GOOGL, on the other hand, risks costly royalty or licensing agreements due to frequent intellectual property litigation, which could result in monetary damages or restrictions on product features. These differing impacts reflect their distinct business models: CMCSA's reliance on content licensing and distribution agreements versus GOOGL's exposure to IP litigation tied to technology development.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - CMCSA notes that 'the inability to license such content on acceptable terms or at all could negatively impact our business' and that 'programming expenses... may be exacerbated by consolidation in the media industry.'",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - GOOGL states that 'adverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements (if licenses are available at all), or orders limiting our ability to sell our products and services.'",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies face financial risks from unfavorable royalty or licensing agreements, but the nature of these risks differs: CMCSA is exposed through content licensing and distribution agreements, while GOOGL faces exposure through intellectual property litigation tied to its technology products."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe also create content for licensing to third parties and to our linear television networks or Peacock. The inability to license such content on acceptable terms or at all could negatively impact our business. Moreover, we may generate lower revenue when we opt to retain our content for our own use, including for Peacock, rather than licensing it to third parties who pay licensing fees for such content.\n\nIf  our  content  does  not  achieve  sufficient  consumer  acceptance,  or  if  we  cannot  obtain  or  retain  rights  to  popular  content  on  acceptable  terms,  or  at  all,  our businesses may be adversely affected.\n\n## Programming expenses for our video services are increasing on a per subscriber basis, which could adversely affect our video businesses.\n\nWe expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to be the largest single expense item for our Residential Connectivity &amp; Platforms business and to continue to increase on a per subscriber basis. Part of these programming expenses include payments to certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to video services customers; we expect to continue to be subject to demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations. These market factors may be exacerbated by consolidation in the media industry, which may further  increase  our  programming  ex penses.  If  we  are  unable  to  offset  programming  cost  increases  through  rate  increases,  the  sale  of  additional  services,  cost management or other initiatives, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\nMoreover, as our contracts with programming providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms, or at all, in which case we may be unable to provide such programming as part of our video services, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\n## The loss of programming distribution agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect our businesses.\n\nOur linear television networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain distribution agreements with traditional and virtual multichannel video providers. The number of subscribers to our television networks has been, and likely will continue to be, reduced as a result of fewer subscribers to multichannel video providers as the media distribution business model changes. Similarly, multichannel video providers may elect not to enter into agreements to distribute some or all of our linear television networks as a result of these changing market dynamics. In addition, our broadcast television networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain network affiliation agreements with third-party local broadcast television stations in the markets where we do not own the affiliated local broadcast television station. Our owned local broadcast television stations must elect, with respect to retransmission by certain multichannel video providers, either 'must-carry' status, in which we require the provider to carry the station without paying any compensation to us, or 'retransmission consent,' in which we give up our right to mandatory carriage and instead seek to negotiate the terms and conditions of carriage, including the amount of compensation, if any, paid to us by such provider.\n\nFor all of these types of arrangements, our ability to renew agreements on acceptable terms may be affected by evolving market dynamics and industry consolidation. There can be no assurance that any of these agreements will be entered into or renewed in the future on similar terms. The inability to enter into or renew some or all of these agreements could reduce our revenues and the reach of our programming, which could adversely affect our businesses.\n\n## Our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of others.\n\nWe rely on our intellectual property, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other third parties, to use various technologies, conduct our business operations and sell our products and services. Legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or other violation by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability, or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question, from importing into the United States or other jurisdictions in which we operate hardware or software that uses such intellectual property or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted. We may need to change our business practices if any of these events occur, which may limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming, costly to defend and may divert management's attention and resources away from our businesses. Moreover, if we are unable to obtain, or continue to obtain, licenses from our vendors and other third parties on reasonable terms, or at all, our businesses could be adversely affected.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

T he v alidity of v arious data transfer mechanisms we currently rely upon remains subject to legal, regulatory, and political dev elopments globally, which may require us to adapt our existing arrangements.\n\nWe face, and may continue to face, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, violation  of  rights  of  publicity,  and  other claims that could be costly to defend, result in significant damage awards or other costs (including indemnification awards), and limit our ability to us e certain technologies.\n\nWe, like other internet, technology, and media companies, are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other v iolations of intellectual property rights, including patent, copyright, trade secrets, and trademarks. Parties hav e also sought broad injunctiv e relief against us by filing claims in U.S. and international courts and the U.S. International T rade Commission (ITC) for exclusion and cease-and-desist orders. In addition, patent-holding companies may frequently seek to generate income from patents they hav e obtained by bringing claims against us. As we continue to expand our business, the number of intellectual property claims against us has increased and may continue to increase as we dev elop and acquire new products, serv ices, and technologies, including AI technologies.\n\nAdverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements (if licenses are av ailable at all), or orders limiting our ability to sell our products and serv ices in the U.S. or elsewhere, including by prev enting us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or serv ices in certain jurisdictions. T hey may also cause us to change our business practices in ways that could result in a loss of rev enues for us and otherwise harm our business.\n\nMany of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to defend against certain intellectual property infringement claims and in some cases indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them, which could result in increased costs for defending such claims or significant damages if there were an adv erse ruling in any such claims.  Such customers and partners may also discontinue the use of our products, serv ices, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of rev enues and harm our  business.

Furthermore, in connection with our div estitures, we hav e agreed, and  may  in  the  future  agree,  to  prov ide  indemnification  for  certain  potential  liabilities,  including  those  associated  with  intellectual  property  claims. Regardless  of  their  merits,  intellectual  property  claims  are  often  time  consuming  and  expensiv e  to  litigate  or  settle.  T o  the  extent  such  claims  are successful, they could harm our business, including our product and serv ice offerings, financial condition, and operating results.\n\n## We could be subject to changes in tax rates,  the  adoption  of  new  U.S.  or  international  tax  legislation,  or  exposure  to  additional  tax liabilities .\n\nWe are subject to a v ariety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effectiv e tax rates are affected by a v ariety of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates, net gains and losses on hedges and related transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, changes in our stock price for shares issued as employee compensation, changes in the v aluation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, and the application of different prov isions of tax laws or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles (including changes in the interpretation of existing laws). Further, if we are unable or fail to collect taxes on behalf of customers, employees and partners as the withholding agent, we could become liable for taxes that are lev ied against third parties.\n\nWe are subject to regular rev iew and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. As a result, we hav e receiv ed, and may in the future receiv e,  assessments  in  multiple  jurisdictions,  on  v arious  tax-related  assertions,  such  as  transfer-pricing  adjustments  or  permanent-establishment claims. Any adv erse outcome of such a rev iew or audit could harm our financial condition and operating results, require adv erse changes to our business practices, or subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries. In addition, the determination of our worldwide prov ision for income taxes and other  tax  liabilities  requires  significant  judgment  and  often  inv olv es  uncertainty. Although  we  believ e  our  estimates  are  reasonable,  the  ultimate  tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\n\nFurthermore, due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies, laws, or rates in v arious jurisdictions may be subject to significant changes in ways that could harm our financial condition and operating results.

Revenues  related  to  cloud  services  provided  on  a  consumption  basis  are  recognized  when  the customer utilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the cloud services.\n\n## Google Other Revenues\n\nGoogle other revenues consist of revenues from:\n\n- Google Play, which includes sales of apps and in-app purchases and digital content sold in the Google Play store;\n- hardware, which includes sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel phones;\n- YouTube non-advertising, which includes YouTube Premium and YouTube TV subscriptions; and\n- other products and services.\n\nAs it relates to Google other revenues, the most significant judgment is determining whether we are the principal or agent for app sales and in-app purchases through the Google Play store. We report revenues from these transactions on a net  basis  because  our  performance  obligation  is  to  facilitate  a  transaction  between  app  developers  and  end  users,  for which we earn a service fee.\n\n## Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\n\nOur  contracts  with  customers  may  include  multiple  performance  obligations.  For  such  arrangements,  we  allocate revenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus margin.\n\n## Customer Incentives and Credits\n\nCertain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration.\n\n## Sales Commissions\n\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred and when the amortization period (the period of the expected benefit) is one year or less. We recognize an asset for certain sales commissions if we expect the period of benefit of these costs to exceed one year and recognize the expense over the amortization period. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.\n\n## Cost of Revenues\n\nCost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n\n- TAC includes:\n- Amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution  partners  include  browser  providers,  mobile  carriers,  original  equipment  manufacturers,  and software developers.\n- Amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n- Other cost of revenues includes:\n- Content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee).",

A membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in the above metrics as of the effective cancellation date. V oluntary cancellations generally become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period. Involuntary cancellations, as a result of a failed method of payment, become effective immediately. Memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign-up as determined by the Company's internal systems, which utilize industry standard geo-location technology.\n\n(2) We believe constant currency information is useful in analyzing the underlying trends in average monthly revenue per paying membership. In order to exclude the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on average monthly revenue per paying membership, we estimate current period revenue assuming foreign exchange rates had remained constant with foreign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prior-year period. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our revenues would have been approximately $443 million lower had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\n## Cost of Revenues\n\nAmortization of content assets makes up the majority of cost of revenues. Expenses directly associated with the acquisition, licensing and production of content (such as payroll and related personnel expenses, costs associated with obtaining rights to music included in our content, overall deals with talent, miscellaneous production related costs and participations and residuals), streaming delivery costs and other operations costs make up the remainder of cost of revenues. We have built our own global content delivery network ('Open Connect') to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet. Delivery expenses, therefore, include equipment costs related to Open Connect, payroll and related personnel expenses and all third-party costs, such as cloud computing costs, associated with delivering content over the internet. Other operations costs include customer service and payment processing fees, including those we pay to our integrated payment partners, as well as other costs directly incurred in making our content available to members.\n\n",

Google's cost of revenues was $110.9 billion, primarily driven by traffic acquisition costs (TAC) and content acquisition costs, with additional contributions from data centers and other operations costs. Netflix's cost of revenues primarily consists of amortization of content assets, expenses related to content acquisition and production, and streaming delivery costs via their global content delivery network (Open Connect), along with third-party cloud computing costs. These cost structures differ significantly, with Google's being more operations and advertising traffic-driven, while Netflix's is centered around content licensing, production, and delivery infrastructure.",

A membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in the above metrics as of the effective cancellation date. V oluntary cancellations generally become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period. Involuntary cancellations, as a result of a failed method of payment, become effective immediately. Memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign-up as determined by the Company's internal systems, which utilize industry standard geo-location technology.\n\n(2) We believe constant currency information is useful in analyzing the underlying trends in average monthly revenue per paying membership. In order to exclude the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on average monthly revenue per paying membership, we estimate current period revenue assuming foreign exchange rates had remained constant with foreign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prior-year period. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our revenues would have been approximately $443 million lower had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\n## Cost of Revenues\n\nAmortization of content assets makes up the majority of cost of revenues. Expenses directly associated with the acquisition, licensing and production of content (such as payroll and related personnel expenses, costs associated with obtaining rights to music included in our content, overall deals with talent, miscellaneous production related costs and participations and residuals), streaming delivery costs and other operations costs make up the remainder of cost of revenues. We have built our own global content delivery network ('Open Connect') to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet. Delivery expenses, therefore, include equipment costs related to Open Connect, payroll and related personnel expenses and all third-party costs, such as cloud computing costs, associated with delivering content over the internet. Other operations costs include customer service and payment processing fees, including those we pay to our integrated payment partners, as well as other costs directly incurred in making our content available to members.\n\n",

      "answer": "Disney amortizes participations and residuals over the applicable product life cycle based on the ratio of the current period's revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues for each production, which results in a more revenue-aligned expense pattern. In contrast, Netflix expenses participations and residuals in line with an accelerated amortization pattern, expecting more upfront viewing, with over 90% of a content asset amortized within four years. This leads to Netflix recognizing a larger portion of expenses earlier in the product life cycle compared to Disney, which adjusts expenses dynamically based on ongoing revenue performance.",

      "question": "How does the allocation of production overhead in capitalized content costs differ between Disney and Netflix, based on their amortization strategies and content monetization models?",
      "answer": "Disney allocates production overhead to capitalized content costs for produced films and television content, and amortizes these costs based on the ratio of current period revenues to estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues) for content monetized individually, such as theatrical films or titles sold to third parties. For group-monetized content (e.g., content used on DTC services or Linear Networks), Disney amortizes the costs based on projected usage, typically resulting in an accelerated or straight-line pattern. In contrast, Netflix also capitalizes production overhead for produced content and amortizes it over the shorter of the contractual window or estimated period of use (typically up to ten years), using an accelerated basis driven by expected viewing patterns. Netflix's amortization is not tied to revenue ratios but rather to viewing behavior, with over 90% of a title's cost typically amortized within four years. This reflects a difference in monetization focus: Disney aligns amortization with revenue realization, while Netflix aligns it with consumption patterns.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Disney capitalizes production overhead for produced content and uses revenue-based amortization for individual monetization, while group content is amortized based on usage.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Netflix capitalizes production overhead for produced content and amortizes it on an accelerated basis over up to ten years, based on viewing patterns.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies capitalize production overhead, but their amortization methods differ: Disney uses revenue-based models tied to monetization strategy (individual vs. group), while Netflix uses consumption-based accelerated amortization."

      "answer": "DIS expenses Participations and Residuals over the applicable product life cycle based on the ratio of current period revenues to estimated remaining total revenues for each production, directly tying these expenses to the monetization pattern of the content. In contrast, NFLX expenses Participations and Residuals in line with the amortization of production costs, which follows an accelerated basis based on expected viewing patterns. This means that DIS's expense recognition is more closely tied to actual revenue generation, whereas NFLX's is aligned with its amortization assumptions and viewing forecasts.",

      "question": "How did the changes in programming and production costs for sports events in 2023 at CMCSA compare to the changes at DIS, considering the specific cost impacts of events like the FIFA World Cup and streaming platform expenditures?",
      "answer": "CMCSA experienced a decrease in programming and production costs in 2023, primarily due to the absence of major sports events like the Beijing Olympics, Super Bowl, and FIFA World Cup, which were broadcast in 2022, and reduced entertainment content costs, despite higher costs at Peacock and international sports programming, including the timing impact of the 2022 FIFA World Cup matches shifting to early 2023. In contrast, DIS saw a slight 1% increase in total programming and production costs in 2023, with Hulu's costs rising by $317 million (from $8,265M to $8,582M), partially offset by a decrease in Disney+ and other costs (from $5,694M to $5,499M). Thus, while CMCSA benefited from lower sports programming costs, DIS faced increased streaming content costs, particularly on Hulu.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - CMCSA's 2023 programming and production costs decreased due to the absence of Beijing Olympics, Super Bowl, and FIFA World Cup costs from 2022 and reduced entertainment content costs, partially offset by higher Peacock and international sports costs, including the timing shift of 2022 FIFA World Cup matches into 2023.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - DIS's total programming and production costs increased by 1% in 2023, with Hulu's costs increasing by $317 million (from $8,265M to $8,582M), while Disney+ and other costs decreased by $195 million (from $5,694M to $5,499M).",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - CMCSA's decrease in programming costs contrasts with DIS's slight increase, with both companies experiencing different cost dynamics related to sports events and streaming platforms. CMCSA saw a benefit from not hosting major sports events in 2023, while DIS faced higher costs on Hulu."

While exact dollar figures were not disclosed for Comcast\u2019s cost reductions, the directional decrease suggests a reduction in content production activity. In contrast, Disney reported specific figures: programming and production costs for Hulu increased by 4% to $8,582 million in 2024 from $8,265 million in 2023, while Disney+ and other services saw a 3% decrease to $5,499 million from $5,694 million. This mixed trend indicates that Disney continued to invest heavily in content for Hulu even as it reduced spending on Disney+. The differing trends suggest that Comcast may have scaled back content production more broadly due to external disruptions, while Disney reallocated resources between platforms.",

      "question": "Given AT&T's disclosures about FCC authority to revoke wireless licenses for cause and Verizon's $155.7 billion valuation of wireless licenses as of December 31, 2023, what specific regulatory risk could directly impact Verizon's asset valuation?",
      "answer": "Verizon faces a direct regulatory risk where the FCC could revoke its wireless licenses for cause, potentially impairing the value of its $155.7 billion wireless license asset. AT&T\u2019s disclosures indicate that while licenses are generally renewed, the FCC has the authority to revoke them if continued operation is not in the public interest. Since wireless licenses are a core intangible asset for carriers and directly tied to their ability to operate, any revocation or non-renewal could materially reduce Verizon\u2019s asset valuation and affect its competitive position.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AT&T discloses that the FCC has the authority to revoke wireless licenses 'for cause' and deny renewal if it is not in the public interest.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Verizon reports a $155.7 billion valuation of its wireless licenses as of December 31, 2023, making it one of its largest assets.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Since wireless licenses are critical assets for wireless carriers and the FCC has the power to revoke them, this regulatory risk could directly impair Verizon\u2019s $155.7 billion asset if the FCC determines Verizon is not operating in the public interest."

      "answer": "T reported a significant increase in Debt Maturing Within One Year from $7,467 million in 2022 to $9,477 million in 2023, indicating a growing short-term liquidity need. In contrast, VZ manages its short-term obligations through asset-backed debt secured by receivables and participation interest, with proceeds classified under Debt Maturing Within One Year and Long-Term Debt. VZ's strategy includes restricted cash and segregated accounts for debt servicing, limiting the impact on general liquidity. T's increase in short-term debt without similar structured arrangements suggests a more direct reliance on near-term financing, which may constrain its liquidity flexibility compared to VZ's structured approach.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - T's Debt Maturing Within One Year increased from $7,467 million in 2022 to $9,477 million in 2023.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - VZ uses asset-backed debt secured by receivables, with cash collections placed in segregated accounts, impacting liquidity differently.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Compare T's rising short-term debt without structured arrangements to VZ's structured, asset-backed approach, which isolates debt-related cash flows from general liquidity."

In contrast, T discloses that its restricted cash balances are specifically maintained for funding deferred compensation benefit payments, reflecting an operational use tied to employee compensation commitments.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities, and Restricted Cash\n\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with financial institutions globally and highly liquid investments with maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. We classify amounts in transit from customer credit cards and payment service providers as cash on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nWe hold investments in  marketable  debt  securities,  consisting  of  U.S.  government  securities,  U.S.  government  agency  securities,  and  investment  grade corporate  debt  securities.  We  classify  our  marketable  debt  securities  as  available-for-sale  (AFS)  investments  in  our  current  assets  because  they  represent investments of cash available for current operations. Our AFS investments are carried at estimated fair value with any unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. AFS debt securities with an amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair value are  assessed  to  determine  what  amount  of  that  difference,  if  any,  is  caused  by  ex pected  credit  losses. Allowance  for  credit  losses  on AFS  debt  securities  are recognized as a charge in interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income, and any remaining unrealized losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. We determine realized gains or losses on sale of marketable securities on a specific identification method and include such gains or losses in interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income.\n\nWe also hold investments in marketable equity securities that are publicly traded stocks. We classify these equity securities as marketable securities within current assets on our consolidated balance sheets because they are available to be converted into cash to fund current operations without any restriction. These marketable equity securities are measured at fair value at each reporting date with the resulted unrealized gains and losses recognized in interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income.\n\nWe classify certain restricted cash balances, consisting mostly of cash related to insurance policies, cash reserves designated for a specific purpose, as well as retention and indemnification holdback for our acquisitions, within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets, based upon the expected duration of the restrictions.\n\n## Non-marketable Equity Securities\n\nOur  non-marketable  equity  securities  are  investments  in  privately-held  companies  without  readily  determinable  fair  values.  We  elected  to  account  for substantially all of our non-marketable equity securities using the measurement alternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer as of the respective transaction dates. We periodically review our nonmarketable equity securities for impairment. When indicators exist and the estimated fair value of an investment is below its carrying amount, we write down the investment  to  fair  value.  The  change  in  carrying  value,  resulted  from  the  remeasurements,  is  recognized  in  interest  and  other  income  (ex pense),  net  on  our consolidated statements of income. For additional information, see Note 6 - Non-marketable Equity Securities.\n\nIn addition, we also held other non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the equity method which were not material as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nWe apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. We define fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:\n\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.",

      "question": "How do the dependencies of both Google and Verizon on market rates affect their respective credit facilities and borrowing costs, and what specific financial risks does this expose each company to?",
      "answer": "Google's credit facilities are tied to market rates, with $4.0 billion expiring in April 2024 and $6.0 billion in April 2028, and interest rates are determined using market rates and sustainability progress. Verizon, on the other hand, faces increased borrowing costs and reduced financing availability due to exposure to market rate fluctuations. This exposes Google to potential increases in interest costs if market rates rise before refinancing, while Verizon risks higher debt servicing costs, reduced flexibility, and vulnerability during business downturns due to its significant reliance on external financing.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Google has $10.0 billion in credit facilities, with interest rates based on market rates and sustainability progress; no amounts were outstanding as of December 31, 2023.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Verizon's debt obligations are subject to variable interest rates or refinancing at potentially higher market rates, increasing interest rate risk and reducing financial flexibility.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies depend on market rates, but in different ways: Google faces refinancing risk tied to rate changes, while Verizon faces ongoing borrowing cost increases and reduced access to financing, exposing each to distinct financial risks."

Both companies use these standalone selling price estimates to allocate transaction prices between services and equipment in bundled contracts, which directly affects the timing and pattern of revenue recognition\u2014Google recognizes revenue ratably over the contract term for subscription-based services, while Verizon recognizes equipment revenue at the point of delivery and service revenue over the enforceable contract term.",

In contrast, Meta's content costs are embedded within broader cost of revenue and tied to infrastructure and partner arrangements, reflecting its ad-based and platform-driven monetization model.

Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\n\nSales commissions we pay in connection with contracts are expensed when incurred because the amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within marketing and sales on our consolidated statements of income. We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original ex pected length of one year or less.\n\nRevenue includes sales and usage-based taxes, except for cases where we are acting as a pass-through agent.\n\n## Advertising Revenue\n\nAdvertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken by our users.\n\nWe recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to users. We recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. In general, we report advertising revenue on a gross basis, since we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers.\n\nFor revenue generated from arrangements that involve third-parties, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report revenue on a gross basis, or the agent, and report revenue on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price.\n\nWe may accept lower consideration than the amount promised per the contract for certain revenue transactions and certain customers may receive cash-based incentives, credits, or refunds, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. We estimate these amounts and reduce revenue based on the amounts expected to be provided to customers. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration for the reported periods.\n\n## Reality Labs Revenue\n\nRL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest and Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, and related software and content. Revenue is recognized at the time control of the products is transferred to customers, which is generally at the time of delivery, in an amount that reflects the consideration RL expects to be entitled to in ex change for the products.\n\n## Other Revenue\n\nFoA other revenue consists of revenue from  WhatsApp Business Platform,  Meta  V erified subscriptions, net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure, and revenue from various other sources.\n\n## Cost of Revenue\n\nOur cost of revenue consists of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These mainly include expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as depreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings, employee compensation which includes payroll, share-based compensation and benefits for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also consists of costs  associated  with  partner  arrangements,  including  traffic  acquisition  costs  and  credit  card  and  other  fees  related  to  processing  customer  transactions;  RL inventory costs, which consist of cost of products sold and estimated losses on non-cancelable contractual commitments; and content costs.",

      "question": "Considering the $10 billion multi-year investment by CMCSA in premium sports content distribution rights, including exclusive NFL and NBA games through 2034, and META's explicit acknowledgment that Reels monetizes at a lower rate than Feed and Stories products, how might the shift in digital advertising pricing baselines impact CMCSA's ability to sustain premium CPMs for linear TV sports advertising over the term of their content agreements?",
      "answer": "CMCSA's $10 billion investment in exclusive sports content distribution rights (including NFL Sunday Night Football and NBA games through 2034) depends on maintaining premium CPMs for linear TV advertising. However, META's shift toward Reels\u2014a format that explicitly monetizes at lower rates than traditional Feed and Stories products\u2014could establish a new baseline for digital advertising pricing. If advertisers reallocate budgets toward lower-cost digital formats like Reels while reducing spending on premium linear TV sports advertising, CMCSA may face pressure to lower CPMs or increase volume to recoup their content investment. This dynamic could challenge the financial returns from CMCSA's long-term sports rights agreements.",

A certain number of NBA games w ill also be distributed in the S panish language on Telemundo.\n\n(b) Includes the rights to produce and distribute on NBC  and on Peacock a specified number of regular season games that includes S unday Night Football games, Thursday Kickoff games and Thanksgiving night games, playoff games, and three remaining S uper Bow l games, the next of w hich is in  February 2026.  The agreement expires after the 2033-34 season, w ith a termination right available to the NFL after the 2029-30 season. The agreement also includes rights to additional exclusive games on Peacock. All of the NFL games are also distributed in the S panish language on Universo or Telemundo.\n\n(c) Includes the unilateral right by the other party (i.e., the licensor) to the agreement, under certain circumstances, to shorten the term of the agreement by one year.\n\nOur  television  and  streaming  business  competes  for  the  acquisition  of  content,  including  sports  rights,  and  for  on-air  and  creative  talent  primarily  with  other television networks,  DTC streaming providers, and local broadcast television stations.  In  Europe, major sports rights, which are significant to our international networks, are usually tendered through a competitive auction process, with the winning bidder or bidders acquiring rights over a 3 to 5 year period.\n\n## Studios Segment\n\nOur Studios segment primarily includes our NBCUniversal and Sky film and television studio production and distribution operations. Our studio production facilities primarily include our owned Universal City location in Los Angeles, California and our leased studios in Atlanta, G eorgia and in Elstree, United Kingdom. Revenue is generated primarily from the worldwide licensing of our owned film and television content and from the worldwide distribution of our produced and acquired films for exhibition in movie theaters. We also generate revenue from the sale of physical and digital home entertainment products, as well as the production and licensing of live stage plays and the distribution of content produced by third parties.\n\n## Film Studios\n\nOur film studios develop, produce, acquire, market and distribute filmed entertainment worldwide. Our films are produced primarily under the following names:\n\n- Universal Pictures\n- Illumination\n- DreamWorks Animation\n- Focus Features\n- Working Title\n\nWe distribute the majority of our films initially for ex hibition in movie theaters, while other films are initially distributed through licensing agreements. After their initial release, we distribute films globally to different customers over multiple licensing windows. We license films, including recent films and selections from our film library, which is comprised of more than 6,500 movies in a variety of genres, to linear television networks and DTC streaming service providers, and to video on demand services provided by multichannel video providers. This includes licenses to our Media and Residential Connectivity &amp; Platforms segments. Certain films are also licensed to our Media segment and made available for viewing on Peacock on the same date as the theatrical release. We also distribute films globally through the sale of physical and digital home entertainment products. Additionally, we acquire distribution rights to films produced by third parties, which may be limited to particular geographic regions, specific forms of media or certain periods of time. Theatrical revenue is significantly affected by the timing of each release and the number of films we distribute, their acceptance by audiences, the number of exhibition screens, ticket prices, the percentage of ticket sales retention by the exhibitors and the popularity of competing films at the time our films are released. The success of a film in movie theaters is generally a significant factor in determining the revenue a film is likely to generate in succeeding licensing windows and through physical and digital home entertainment product sales.\n\nWe develop and produce films both alone and jointly with other studios or production companies. In certain cases, we have also entered into film co-financing arrangements with third party studios and non-studio entities to jointly finance or distribute certain of our film productions. These arrangements can take various forms, but in most cases involve the grant of an economic interest in a film to an investor. Investors generally assume the full risks and rewards of ownership proportionate to their ownership in the film.\n\nIn connection with film studio productions, we typically owe 'residuals' payments to individuals hired under collective bargaining agreements, which are generally calculated based on post-theatrical or content licensing revenue.  We also typically owe 'participations' payments to creative talent, to third parties under cofinancing agreements and to other parties involved in content production, which are generally based on the financial performance of the content.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

From time to time, we also change the size, frequency, or relative prominence of ads as part of our product and monetization strategies. In addition, we have made, and we expect to continue to make, other changes to our products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of publishers, marketers, and developers, and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on our products. We also may introduce new features or other changes to existing products, or introduce new stand-alone products, that attract users away from properties, formats, or use cases where we have more proven means of monetization, such as our Feed products. In addition, as we focus on growing users and engagement across our family of products, from time to time these efforts have reduced, and may in the future reduce, engagement with one or more products and services in favor of other products or services that we monetize less successfully or that are not growing as quickly. For example, we plan to continue to promote Reels, which we expect will continue to monetize at a lower rate than our Feed and Stories products for the foreseeable future. These decisions may adversely affect our business and results of operations and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.\n\n## We may not be successful in our Reality Labs strategy and investments, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\n\nOur  Reality  Labs  efforts  include  our  metaverse  and  wearables  initiatives.  We  believe  the  metaverse,  an  embodied  internet  where  people  have  immersive experiences beyond two-dimensional screens, is the next evolution in social technology. In 2021, we announced a shift in our business and product strategy to focus on helping to bring the metaverse to life, and we are directing our efforts toward innovations in AI, wearables, and devices to help build next-generation interfaces. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative that will involve the development of new and emerging technologies, continued investment in infrastructure as well as privacy, safety, and security efforts, and collaboration with other companies, developers, partners, and other participants. However, the metaverse may not develop in accordance with our expectations, and market acceptance of features, products, or services we build is uncertain.  We regularly evaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as our understanding of the technological challenges and market landscape and our product ideas and designs evolve. In addition, we have relatively limited experience with consumer hardware products and virtual, augmented, and mixed reality technology, which may enable other companies to compete more effectively than us. We may be unsuccessful in our research and product development efforts, including if we are unable to develop relationships with key participants in the metaverse or develop products that operate effectively with metaverse technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. For example, some of our consumer hardware products depend on the ability to operate with third-party mobile platforms and these platforms do not necessarily provide our products with the same levels of interoperability that they provide to their own competing products. In addition, our Reality Labs efforts may also divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We expect to continue to make significant investments in virtual, augmented, and mixed reality and other technologies to support these efforts, and our ability to support these efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. In addition, as our Reality Labs efforts evolve, we may be subject to a variety of existing or new laws and regulations in the United States and international jurisdictions, including in the areas of privacy, safety, AI, competition, content regulation, tariffs, ex port controls, consumer protection, and e-commerce, which may delay or impede the development of our products and services, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, or otherwise harm our business. As a result of these or other factors, our Reality Labs strategy and investments may not be successful in the foreseeable future, or at all, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\n\n## If we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, our ability to maintain or expand our base of users, marketers, and developers may be impaired, and our business and financial results may be harmed.\n\nWe believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to maintaining and ex panding our base of users, marketers, and developers. Many of our new users are referred by existing users. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which we may not do successfully. We may introduce new products, terms of service, or policies that users do not like, which may negatively affect our brands. Additionally, the actions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using third-party applications integrated with our products or interacting with parties that advertise through our products. We will also continue to experience media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny of our actions or decisions regarding user privacy, data use, encryption, content, product design, algorithms, advertising, competition, generative AI, younger users, and other issues, including actions or decisions in connection with elections or geopolitical events, which has adversely affected, and",

In contrast, META's cost of revenue includes expenses related to content delivery, such as traffic acquisition costs and infrastructure, which are part of its broader operational expenses.

Payments of income taxes in 2024 were favorably impacted by the timing of transferable tax credit purchases, as payments for certain tax  credits used in 2024 will be made in 2025. Additionally, we ex pect to receive a federal income tax  refund in 2025 as a result of carrying back a capital loss created primarily as part of a 2024 internal corporate reorganization to offset capital gains recognized in our federal income tax  returns for 2021 through 2023 (see Note 5).\n\n## Investing Activities\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased in 2024 primarily due to net proceeds received as an advance on the sale of our interest in Hulu in the prior year (see Note 7), partially offset by decreased cash paid for intangible assets related to software development in the current year and decreased purchases of investments.\n\nWe expect to receive additional proceeds for the sale of our interest in Hulu following the finalization of the third-party appraisal process, at which time we will recognize the sale of our interest. See Note 7.\n\nIn September 2023, we entered into an agreement with T-Mobile to sell certain of our spectrum licenses. The agreement provides us with a right to remove certain licenses from the transaction, which will result in total cash consideration between $1.2 billion and $3.3 billion. The sale is ex pected to close in 2028 subject to various conditions and approvals.\n\n## Capital Expenditures\n\nCapital expenditures remained consistent in 2024 compared to 2023. Spending on theme park attractions increased in 2024, and included costs associated with the construction of Epic Universe. 2023 expenditures included the acquisition of land for potential theme park expansion opportunities. The costs associated with the construction of Universal Beijing Resort are presented separately in our consolidated statements of cash flows. See Note 7.\n\nOur most significant capital expenditures are within the Connectivity &amp; Platforms business, and we expect that this will continue in the future. Connectivity &amp; Platforms' capital ex penditures remained consistent in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to increased spending on line extensions and support capital, offset by decreased spending on customer premise equipment and scalable infrastructure. The table below summarizes the capital expenditures we incurred in our segments in the Connectivity &amp; Platforms business in 2024 and 2023.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\n\nSales commissions we pay in connection with contracts are expensed when incurred because the amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within marketing and sales on our consolidated statements of income. We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original ex pected length of one year or less.\n\nRevenue includes sales and usage-based taxes, except for cases where we are acting as a pass-through agent.\n\n## Advertising Revenue\n\nAdvertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken by our users.\n\nWe recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to users. We recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. In general, we report advertising revenue on a gross basis, since we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers.\n\nFor revenue generated from arrangements that involve third-parties, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report revenue on a gross basis, or the agent, and report revenue on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price.\n\nWe may accept lower consideration than the amount promised per the contract for certain revenue transactions and certain customers may receive cash-based incentives, credits, or refunds, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. We estimate these amounts and reduce revenue based on the amounts expected to be provided to customers. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration for the reported periods.\n\n## Reality Labs Revenue\n\nRL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest and Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, and related software and content. Revenue is recognized at the time control of the products is transferred to customers, which is generally at the time of delivery, in an amount that reflects the consideration RL expects to be entitled to in ex change for the products.\n\n## Other Revenue\n\nFoA other revenue consists of revenue from  WhatsApp Business Platform,  Meta  V erified subscriptions, net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure, and revenue from various other sources.\n\n## Cost of Revenue\n\nOur cost of revenue consists of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These mainly include expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as depreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings, employee compensation which includes payroll, share-based compensation and benefits for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also consists of costs  associated  with  partner  arrangements,  including  traffic  acquisition  costs  and  credit  card  and  other  fees  related  to  processing  customer  transactions;  RL inventory costs, which consist of cost of products sold and estimated losses on non-cancelable contractual commitments; and content costs.",

      "answer": "Comcast recognizes ad revenue net of agency commissions in the period advertisements are aired or delivered, with payment generally required within 30 days, and defers revenue when ratings guarantees are not met, providing additional advertising units to settle shortfalls. This structured revenue recognition approach provides a relatively stable and predictable financial reporting framework for Comcast's advertising business. In contrast, Meta's stock price is explicitly noted to be sensitive to announcements or estimates of changes in user base, engagement levels, or ad product effectiveness, which introduces volatility and unpredictability into Meta's financial reporting environment. As a result, while Comcast's ad revenue is reported with defined timing and contractual obligations, Meta's financial outcomes are more exposed to market sentiment shifts based on public disclosures, making its financial reporting less predictable.",

      "question": "Considering META's challenges in digital advertising competition affecting ad targeting and measurement, and CMCSA's policy of recognizing advertising revenue net of agency commissions upon delivery, how would a shift in advertiser spending from digital platforms like META to traditional linear TV advertising impact CMCSA's revenue recognition timing and META's financial performance, given META's stated competitive risks?",
      "answer": "A shift in advertiser spending from digital platforms like META to traditional linear TV advertising would accelerate CMCSA's revenue recognition and potentially increase its reported revenue, as CMCSA recognizes advertising revenue in the period in which advertisements are aired or delivered. This shift would also negatively impact META's financial performance, as META explicitly states that competition, particularly from companies that limit its ability to target and measure ads effectively, could cause advertisers to generate revenue at the expense of META\u2019s own advertising business.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From CMCSA's filing, advertising revenue is recognized net of agency commissions in the period advertisements are aired or delivered, indicating that increased ad spending on linear TV would result in faster and potentially higher revenue recognition for CMCSA.",
        "Step 2: From META's filing, the company acknowledges that competition, especially from companies that limit META\u2019s ability to target and measure ads (such as Apple\u2019s iOS changes), could cause advertisers to shift budgets away from META and toward competing platforms, directly harming its advertising revenue.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize \u2014 If advertisers shift spending from META\u2019s digital platform to CMCSA\u2019s linear TV due to competitive pressures affecting META\u2019s targeting and measurement capabilities, CMCSA would see faster revenue recognition and potentially higher revenue, while META would experience reduced advertising revenue, aligning with the risks META explicitly discloses."

      "answer": "VZ reported a decrease of $82 million in customer premise equipment costs due to lower volumes sold, treating these costs as operating expenses that directly reduced current period profitability. In contrast, CMCSA capitalizes customer premise equipment costs associated with installation as part of property and equipment, spreading the expense over the asset's estimated useful life rather than recognizing it immediately. This results in different financial impacts: VZ's approach lowers current expenses and potentially short-term profitability, while CMCSA's capitalization defers costs to future periods through depreciation.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_b, VZ explicitly states a decrease of $82 million in customer premise equipment costs due to lower volumes sold, indicating these are treated as operating expenses in the current period.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_a, CMCSA states that it capitalizes the costs associated with acquiring and deploying new customer premise equipment in accordance with cable television company accounting guidance, meaning these are not expensed immediately but instead depreciated over time.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize that while both companies incur customer premise equipment costs, their financial treatment differs significantly\u2014VZ expenses these items directly affecting current earnings, whereas CMCSA capitalizes and depreciates them, impacting long-term asset values and future depreciation expense."

In addition to our significant U.S. infrastructure, we have a presence globally and relationships with many operators and partners allowing us to service multinational network needs.\n- Services and capabilities - We provide connectivity , access to the internet, voice calling, text messaging and both linear and streaming video capabilities. Beyond these basic services, our network solutions include advanced services and capabilities such as E911, first responder solutions and private networking solutions.\n- Reliability - We strive to design and deploy reliable networks. We test our networks for reliability and use various methods and procedures to maintain network availability , capability  and capacity . T o mitigate the impact of power disruptions on our operations, we have battery backup at every switch and every macro cell. We also utilize backup generators at a majority of our macro cells and at every switch location. In addition, we have a fleet of portable backup generators that can be deployed if needed.\n\n## Network Evolution\n\nWe consider the reliability , speed, capacity , coverage and security of our wireless network to be key factors in our continued success. We are evolving and transforming our networks to ensure our customers receive access to the best network possible. A reas of evolution and transformation include:\n\n- 5G Wireless - V eriz on has driv en the conversion from 4G to 5G through a sequence of network changes involving the radio access network, the core network infrastructure and change to the devices connecting to the network. Over the past several years, we have been leading the development of 5G wireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and mobile 5G wireless services. 5G technology enables higher throughput and lower latency than 4G LTE technology and allows our networks to handle more traffic as the number of internet-connected devices and customer usage needs grow. Our evolution to 5G with its new architecture allows us to simplify operations by eliminating legacy network elements.\n- Coverage and densification - We continue to improve 5G wireless service coverage by leveraging our breadth of wireless spectrum, including millimeter wave and C-Band spectrum, which we are continuing to deploy across the continental U.S. We are densifying our networks by utilizing macro and small cell technology , in-building solutions and distributed antenna systems. Network densification enables us to increase coverage, improve quality of service and add capacity to accommodate an increasing number of users. It also supports our growing FWA  business and growing bandwidth needs for uses such as streaming and video content creation.\n- Virtualization - We are leveraging the benefits of cloud computing and storage as we evolve our network infrastructure. Our private cloud infrastructure allows us to use shared compute, storage and networking resources rather than building unique physical instances for our network infrastructure.\n- Fiber transport and IP networking - We own and operate one of the largest global fiber-optic networks in the world, providing connectivity to Business customers in more than 180 countries. Our global IP network includes long-haul, metro and submarine assets that enable and support international operations. In response to growing bandwidth demand, we have upgraded and increased our long-haul core fiber-based transport capacity as well as our IP network capacity and efficiency . W e continue to build local fiber networks by adding fiber connectivity to premises, venues, cell tower locations and data centers.\n- Energy efficiency - We strive to improve the energy efficiency of our networks, facilities and fleet. W e are balancing increased energy needs from ongoing expansion and densification of our networks with initiatives to effectively manage energy consumption, including using more energy-efficient equipment, discontinuing or migrating legacy services and pursuing opportunities to use renewable energy sources.\n\n## Fios\n\nResidential broadband service has seen significant growth in bandwidth demand over the past several years, and we believe that demand will continue to grow. We expect that the continued emergence of new video services, new data applications and the proliferation of IP devices in the home will continue to drive new network requirements for increased data speeds and throughput. We believe that the Passive Optical Network (PON) technology underpinning Fios positions us well to meet these demands in a cost-effective and efficient manner. We also continue to evolve the in-home broadband router element to bring new capability and improved performance, such as improved Wi-Fi, to our retail customers.\n\nWhile deployed initially as a consumer broadband network, our Fios infrastructure is also experiencing more widespread application in the Business segment, especially as businesses increasingly migrate to ethernet-based access services.\n\nIn September 2024, we entered into an agreement to acquire Frontier Communications Parent, Inc. (Frontier), a U.S. provider of broadband internet and other communication services. Upon closing, this transaction is expected to enhance our fiber broadband footprint and provide opportunities for future Fios growth.",

      "answer": "CMCSA's consolidated interest expense increased in 2024 due to both a rise in average debt outstanding and higher weighted-average interest rates, despite a prior-year expense related to a collateralized obligation that was repaid. In contrast, VZ also experienced higher interest expense, but this was driven by a higher average interest rate even though its average debt balances decreased. This reveals that CMCSA's strategy involved maintaining or increasing debt levels despite higher borrowing costs, while VZ managed to reduce debt but faced cost pressures from rising interest rates. Both companies faced higher interest expenses, but the underlying drivers reflect different approaches to managing their capital structures.",

      "answer": "Meta's financial performance is more directly tied to maintaining user retention because its revenue is heavily dependent on ad impressions from active users on platforms like Facebook and Instagram. Google also relies on user retention, particularly for services that support its advertising ecosystem, but its broader portfolio\u2014including cloud services and enterprise offerings\u2014provides more diversified revenue streams.

Failing to attract  and  retain  a  substantial  number  of  dev ice  manufacturers,  suppliers,  distributors,  dev elopers,  and  users,  or  failing  to  dev elop  products  and technologies that work well on new dev ices and platforms, could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results and ability to capture future business opportunities.\n\n## Is s ues  in the development and use of AI may result in reputational harm and increased liability exposure.\n\nOur evolv ing AI-related efforts may giv e rise to risks related to harmful content, inaccuracies, discrimination, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, v iolation of rights of publicity, defamation, data priv acy, cybersecurity, and other issues. As a result of these and other challenges associated  with  innov ativ e  technologies,  our  implementation  of  AI  systems  could  subject  us  to  competitiv e  harm,  regulatory  action,  legal  liability (including under new and proposed legislation and regulations), new applications of existing data protection, priv acy, intellectual property, and other laws, and brand or reputational harm.\n\nSome uses of AI will present ethical issues and may hav e broad effects on society. In order to implement AI responsibly and minimize unintended harmful effects, we hav e already dev oted and will continue to inv est significant resources to dev elop, test, and maintain our products and serv ices, but we may  not  be  able  to  identify  or  resolv e  all  AI-related  issues,  deficiencies,  and/or  failures  before  they  arise.  Unintended  consequences,  uses,  or customization of our AI tools and systems may negativ ely affect human rights, priv acy, employment, or other social concerns, which may result in claims, lawsuits, brand or reputational harm, and increased regulatory scrutiny, any of which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nData privacy and security concerns relating to our technology and our practices could harm our reputation, cause us to incur significant liability, and deter current and potential users or customers from using our products and services. Computer viruses, software bugs or defects, security breaches, and attacks on our systems could result in the improper disclosure and use of user data and interference with our users' and customers' ability to use our products and services, harming our business and reputation.\n\nConcerns about, including the adequacy of, our practices with regard to the collection, use, gov ernance, disclosure, or security of personal data or other data-priv acy-related matters, ev en if unfounded, could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Our policies and practices may change ov er time as expectations and regulations regarding priv acy and data change.\n\nOur products and serv ices inv olv e the storage, handling, and transmission of proprietary and other sensitiv e information. Malicious software such as viruses, software bugs, theft, misuse, defects, v ulnerabilities in our products and serv ices, as well as cyber attacks, phishing schemes, and other types of security breaches expose us to a risk of loss or improper use and disclosure of such information, which could result in litigation and other potential liabilities,  including  regulatory  fines  and  penalties,  as  well  as  reputational  harm. Additionally,  our  products  incorporate  highly  technical  and  complex technologies,  and  thus  our  technologies  and  software  hav e  contained,  and  are  likely  in  the  future  to  contain,  undetected  errors,  bugs,  and/or vulnerabilities. We continue to add new features inv olv ing AI to our offerings and internal systems, and features that rely on AI may be susceptible to unanticipated security threats as our and the market's understanding of AI-centric security risks and protection methods continue to dev elop. We hav e in the  past  discov ered,  and  may  in  the  future  discov er ,  some  errors  in  our  software  code  only  after  we  hav e  released  the  code.  Systems  and  control failures,  security  breaches,  failure  to  comply  with  our  priv acy  policies,  and/or  inadv ertent  disclosure  of  user  data  could  result  in  regulatory  and  legal exposure, seriously  harm  our  reputation,  brand,  and  business,  and  impair  our  ability  to  attract  and  retain  users  or  customers.  Such  incidents  hav e occurred  in  the  past  and  may  continue  to  occur  due  to  the  scale  and  nature  of  our  products  and  serv ices.  While  there  is  no  guarantee  that  such incidents will not cause significant damage, we expect to continue to expend significant resources to maintain security protections that limit the effect of bugs, theft, misuse, and security v ulnerabilities or breaches.\n\nWe experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis. Cyber attacks continue to ev olv e in sophistication and v olume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. For example, the dev elopment and implementation of AI technologies  may  further  increase  our  exposure  to  or  exacerbate  the  risks  of  cyber  attacks  or  other  security  incidents,  particularly  where  such technologies are exploited by third parties to breach our or other parties' systems, including when such technologies are used to target our employees or impersonate members of senior management in order to gain unauthorized access to our systems. We have also seen, and will continue to see, industry-wide software supply chain v ulnerabilities, which could affect our or other parties' systems. We expect to continue to experience such incidents or v ulnerabilities in the future. Our efforts to prev ent security incidents and address undesirable activ ity on our platform may require us to spend additional resources to prepare and defend against such threats, and could also increase the risk of retaliatory attack.

Our financial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in adding, retaining, and engaging active users of our products that deliver ad impressions, particularly for Facebook and Instagram. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations and declines in the size of our active user base in one or more markets from time to time, particularly in markets where we have achieved higher penetration rates. User growth and engagement are also impacted by a number of other factors, including competitive products and services, such as TikTok, that have reduced some users' engagement with our products and services, as well as global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical conditions. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic led to increases and decreases in the size and engagement of our active user base from period to period at different points during the pandemic. In addition, in connection with the war in Ukraine, access to Facebook and Instagram was restricted in Russia and these services were then prohibited by the Russian government, which contributed to slight decreases in the size of our active user base following the onset of the war. Any future declines in the size of our active user base may adversely impact our ability to deliver ad impressions and, in turn, our financial performance.\n\nIf people do not perceive our products to be useful, reliable, and trustworthy, we may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement. A number of other social networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user bases or  levels  of  engagement  decline,  in  some  cases  precipitously.

      "question": "How did CMCSA's change in amortization of software in 2024 compare with T's reported amortization of network software, and what does this indicate about their respective capital investment patterns?",
      "answer": "CMCSA reported a decrease in the amortization of software in 2024, which partially offset the overall increase in consolidated depreciation and amortization expense driven by higher amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets (e.g., $2.7 billion in 2024 from such assets). In contrast, T disclosed a consistent increase in amortization of network software, reaching $3,076 million in 2024, indicating sustained investment in software supporting its network infrastructure. This comparison suggests that while T is continuing to invest in and amortize network software, CMCSA appears to be managing software investment more cautiously, even as it increases spending on intangible assets from acquisitions like the linear media business.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, identify that CMCSA experienced a decrease in amortization of software in 2024, despite an overall increase in depreciation and amortization driven by acquisition-related intangible assets.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, extract T's amortization of network software at $3,076 million in 2024, showing an upward trend.",
        "Step 3: Compare the two trends: CMCSA's software amortization decreased while T's increased, despite both being in the same sector.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize to infer differing capital investment patterns: T is investing more in network software, while CMCSA is focusing on intangible assets from acquisitions and managing software amortization downward."

Depreciation expense included amortization of software totaling $3,076 in 2024, $3,023 in 2023 and $2,972 in 2022.\n\nIn December 2022, we recorded a noncash pre-tax charge of $1,413 to abandon conduits that will not be utilized to support future network activity. The abandonment was considered outside the ordinary course of business.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, we updated our analysis of economic lives of AT&amp;T-owned fiber network assets. As of January 1, 2022, we extended the estimated economic life and depreciation period of such costs to better reflect the physical life of the assets that we had been ex periencing and absence of technological changes that would replace fiber as the best broadband technology in the industry. The change in accounting estimate decreased depreciation expense $280, or $0.03 per diluted share from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\n## NOTE 8. LEASES\n\nWe have operating and finance leases for certain facilities and equipment used in our operations. Our leases generally have remaining lease terms of up to 15 years. Some of our operating leases (e.g., for towers and real estate) contain renewal options that may be exercised, and some of our leases include options to terminate the leases within one year.\n\nWe have recognized a right-of-use asset for both operating and finance leases, and a corresponding lease liability that represents the present value of our obligation to make payments over the lease term. The present value of the lease payments is calculated using the incremental borrowing rate for operating and finance leases, which was determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest that we would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. We use the unsecured borrowing rate and risk-adjust that rate to approximate a collateralized rate in the currency of the lease, which will be updated on a quarterly basis for measurement of new lease liabilities.\n\nThe components of lease expense were as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "GOOGL experienced a $5.2 billion increase in Other Cost of Revenues in 2023, driven by higher content acquisition costs for YouTube and compensation expenses, including $479 million in employee severance charges. This increase put upward pressure on total costs, likely compressing operating margins unless offset by revenue growth. In contrast, T saw a $395 million decrease in Other Cost of Revenues due to a change in accounting estimate that extended the amortization period for customer acquisition and fulfillment costs, which improved their operating margin by reducing current-period expenses. These contrasting trends reflect GOOGL\u2019s strategic investments and restructuring while T optimized accounting policies to enhance margin performance.",

        "Step 1: From GOOGL's 10-K, extract the $5.2 billion increase in Other Cost of Revenues and the specific drivers: YouTube content costs, compensation expenses, and $479 million in severance charges.",
        "Step 2: From T's 10-K, extract the $395 million decrease in Other Cost of Revenues due to a change in accounting estimate for amortization periods of customer contracts.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the implications: GOOGL\u2019s cost increase likely pressured margins unless offset by revenue, while T\u2019s cost reduction improved margins without operational changes, highlighting different approaches to cost management."

AT&T's disclosure reveals that amortization costs related to customer contract acquisition and fulfillment\u2014primarily included in 'Selling, general and administrative' and 'Other cost of revenues'\u2014suggest a different composition of operational expenses focused on customer acquisition rather than content and labor.

      "question": "Given META's 13% increase in annual worldwide ARPU in 2023 and VZ's exposure to regulatory risks including privacy laws and potential Title II regulation, how do differing external pressures shape each company's ability to sustain revenue growth through ARPU expansion?",
      "answer": "META achieved a 13% increase in annual worldwide ARPU in 2023, driven by double-digit growth across all geographic regions, despite user growth being concentrated in lower ARPU areas like Asia-Pacific and Rest of World. In contrast, VZ faces significant regulatory risks\u2014including privacy laws like the California Consumer Privacy Act and Europe\u2019s GDPR, as well as the FCC\u2019s potential return to Title II regulation\u2014which could restrict its ability to manage networks, introduce new services, and maintain pricing flexibility. These regulatory pressures may limit VZ\u2019s capacity to grow ARPU through service innovation or pricing adjustments, unlike META, which operates with fewer such constraints and has demonstrated strong ARPU growth.

      "answer": "Google's cost of revenues increased by 6% year-over-year, driven in part by increases in content acquisition costs, compensation expenses, and TAC. This included $2.1 billion in employee severance charges and $1.8 billion in exit charges related to office space optimization. Meanwhile, Netflix's cost of revenues was primarily driven by amortization of content assets, with additional expenses related to content acquisition, production, and streaming delivery through its Open Connect network. Both companies experienced cost pressures in their content strategies, though Google offset some of its cost increases through a change in the estimated useful lives of servers, reducing depreciation expense by $3.9 billion, while Netflix focused on internal content delivery efficiency to manage costs.",

This reflects a platform-centric model where Google leverages external content to drive engagement and monetization through advertising and distribution. In contrast, Netflix's cost of revenues is dominated by amortization of content assets, which includes expenses related to content acquisition, licensing, and production, such as payroll, stock-based compensation, and production costs. This highlights Netflix's vertically integrated model, where it invests heavily in acquiring and producing exclusive content to monetize directly through subscriptions.

      "answer": "A decline in ad quality would negatively impact META's advertising revenue because their revenue is heavily dependent on delivering effective ads to marketers. If ad targeting capabilities are reduced or the quantity/quality of ads declines, it could lead to reduced demand from marketers and lower pricing power, directly harming revenue. For NFLX, a decline in ad quality could reduce member satisfaction and retention, particularly among users of their ad-supported subscription plan. Since NFLX's advertising revenue depends on member engagement and the attractiveness of its ad inventory, poor ad quality could lead to dissatisfaction, higher churn, and reduced advertising demand, thereby negatively impacting both revenue streams.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From META's 10-K, ad quality directly affects their ability to deliver effective ads, which influences marketer demand and pricing. A decline in ad quality would likely reduce the return on investment for marketers, leading to reduced ad spending and negatively affecting META's advertising revenue.",
        "Step 2: From NFLX's 10-K, their ad-supported subscription plan relies on member engagement and the quantity/quality of ads shown. Poor ad quality could lead to dissatisfaction among members, increasing churn and reducing the attractiveness of their service to advertisers.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - A simultaneous decline in ad quality would harm both companies by undermining META's core advertising business and NFLX's ability to retain ad-supported subscribers and attract advertisers, creating dual financial pressures on both revenue models."

      "question": "How did foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the combined constant currency revenue growth for Meta and Netflix in 2023?",
      "answer": "Meta's total revenue for 2023 was $134.90 billion, reflecting a 16% year-over-year increase, but on a constant currency basis, the growth would have been 15%. This indicates that foreign exchange rate fluctuations contributed approximately 1% to Meta's revenue growth. For Netflix, foreign exchange rate fluctuations reduced revenue by approximately $597 million in 2023 compared to constant currency rates from the prior year. When combining the two effects, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had a mixed impact: contributing positively to Meta's reported growth rate while negatively affecting Netflix's revenue in absolute terms.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Meta's total revenue for 2023 was $134.90 billion, with a 16% year-over-year increase; however, on a constant currency basis, the growth would have been 15%.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Netflix reported that foreign exchange rate fluctuations reduced its 2023 revenue by approximately $597 million compared to constant currency rates from the prior year.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Meta's revenue growth was slightly inflated by foreign exchange effects (16% vs. 15%), whereas Netflix experienced an absolute revenue reduction of $597 million. This shows that foreign exchange fluctuations had opposing impacts on the two companies' constant currency revenue growth."

      "answer": "META identifies that the 'frequency, prominence, size, format, and quality of the ads displayed' directly influence its ability to monetize its platform and deliver a compelling return on investment for marketers. If these ad characteristics are not optimized, META risks losing marketer interest, which could materially affect its revenue. On the other hand, NFLX acknowledges that 'member dissatisfaction due to advertisements' poses a unique risk to its ad-supported subscription plan, which could impact membership growth and engagement, ultimately limiting its ability to attract and retain advertisers. While both companies depend on ad quality, META's vulnerability centers on ad effectiveness for marketers, whereas NFLX faces a dual challenge of maintaining subscriber satisfaction while monetizing ads, making their financial risks distinct and specific to their business models.",

      "answer": "META's product changes, such as limiting ad targeting through user data controls and promoting Reels (which monetizes at a lower rate), reduce user engagement and content distribution effectiveness for publishers and developers, thereby decreasing their incentive to invest in META\u2019s platform. Meanwhile, NFLX's ability to maintain a compelling content mix depends on securing third-party licenses, and any failure to do so could lead to reduced member retention and satisfaction. Together, both companies face challenges in maintaining user engagement and monetization: META through self-imposed product constraints and NFLX through external licensing dependencies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - META has implemented changes such as the Off-Facebook Activity tool and promotion of Reels, which reduce ad targeting effectiveness and monetization potential, adversely affecting content distribution and publisher incentives.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - NFLX relies on third-party licenses for content distribution and faces risks if rights holders refuse to license content on acceptable terms, which could reduce the availability of compelling content and impact member retention.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies experience challenges in content distribution that affect user engagement and monetization: META through internal product decisions and NFLX through external licensing constraints."

      "question": "As both NFLX and T reported changes in their 'Other Cost of Revenues' for 2023, how do the underlying drivers of these changes reflect differing cost management strategies, considering NFLX experienced a $376 million increase due to content acquisition and T reported a $395 million decrease from extended amortization periods for customer contracts?",
      "answer": "NFLX's 'Other Cost of Revenues' increased by $376 million in 2023, primarily due to higher expenses associated with content acquisition, licensing, and production. This reflects a strategy of investing more heavily in content to support growth. In contrast, T's 'Other Cost of Revenues' decreased by approximately $395 million due to an accounting policy change that extended the amortization period for customer acquisition and fulfillment costs. This change indicates a cost management strategy focused on spreading expenses over a longer period, reducing short-term cost impact. The two companies, while both in the Communication Services sector, demonstrate opposing trends and strategies: NFLX is increasing investment in direct content costs, while T is optimizing cost recognition through accounting adjustments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - NFLX reported a $376 million increase in 'Other Cost of Revenues' due to expenses related to content acquisition, licensing, and production.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - T reported a $395 million decrease in 'Other Cost of Revenues' due to extended amortization periods for customer contract acquisition and fulfillment costs.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are in the same sector but show opposite changes in the same financial metric. NFLX's increase reflects aggressive investment in content, while T's decrease reflects a cost-reduction accounting policy change."

      "answer": "The total potential favorable impact on effective tax rates from unrecognized tax benefits at both NFLX and T as of December 31, 2023, is $188 million for NFLX and $2,361 for T, resulting in a combined impact of $188,002,361. This is calculated by summing the respective unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) that both companies disclose would favorably impact their effective tax rates if recognized.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A (NFLX) - As of December 31, 2023, $188 million of the $327 million in gross unrecognized tax benefits would favorably impact the effective tax rate.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B (T) - As of December 31, 2023, $2,361 in deposits reduced the UTB balance, which directly affects the unrecognized tax benefits that could impact the effective tax rate.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The question requires summing the specific UTB amounts from both NFLX and T that would impact the effective tax rate, which can only be answered by combining the precise figures from both filings."

      "question": "How does the 26% increase in Disney's advertising revenue from impressions, driven by Disney+ ad-supported service launches and increased cricket programming, compare with Alphabet's impression-based monetization performance as disclosed in their 2023 10-K?",
      "answer": "Disney reported a 26% increase in advertising revenue from impressions, driven by the launch of the ad-supported Disney+ service domestically in December 2022 and internationally starting in November 2023, as well as increased cricket programming on Disney+ Hotstar, including two ICC tournaments compared to one in the prior year. Alphabet disclosed changes in monetization metrics for Google Network revenues, which are impression- and cost-per-impression-based, but did not provide specific growth percentages or drivers for impression volume growth. This makes a direct performance comparison between Disney's impression growth and Alphabet's impression monetization metrics impossible, though both companies highlight impressions as a key advertising revenue driver.",

      "question": "How does the increase in cash tax payments for DIS in fiscal 2023, influenced by tax deferrals due to California winter storms, contrast with the potential future increase in GOOGL's cash tax payments due to international tax policy changes, and what is the combined impact on their respective cash reserves?",
      "answer": "DIS experienced an increase in cash tax payments in fiscal 2023, partly due to deferred fiscal 2023 U.S. federal and California state tax payments being paid in fiscal 2024 as a result of relief following 2023 winter storms. This led to higher cash outflows for DIS in the current year. Meanwhile, GOOGL anticipates that international tax policy changes, such as the OECD's proposed global minimum effective tax rate of 15%, could increase its effective tax rate and cash tax payments in future years. The combined impact is that both companies face upward pressure on cash tax payments, but DIS is dealing with timing shifts due to natural disasters, while GOOGL faces structural tax risk due to regulatory changes, both of which constrain cash reserves available for reinvestment or shareholder returns.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - DIS had higher cash tax payments in fiscal 2023, with fiscal 2023 U.S. federal and California state tax payments deferred and paid in fiscal 2024 due to 2023 winter storms.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - GOOGL expects its effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase in future years due to international tax policy changes, including the OECD's proposed 15% global minimum effective tax rate.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both DIS and GOOGL are experiencing or anticipating increases in cash tax payments, but for different reasons: DIS due to timing shifts from natural disaster-related tax deferrals, and GOOGL due to regulatory and policy-driven tax rate increases. Both impact cash reserves, though through different mechanisms and timeframes."

We may not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims.\n\n## If we are not able to manage change and growth, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nWe are expanding our operations internationally, scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members and features related to our service, as well as scaling our ability to program and produce original content, introducing games on our service. As our international offering evolves, we are managing and adjusting our business to address varied content offerings, consumer customs and practices, in particular those dealing with e-commerce and streaming video, as well as differing legal and regulatory environments. As we scale our streaming service, we are developing technology and utilizing third-party 'cloud' computing services. As we scale our content production, including now games, we are building out expertise in a number of disciplines, including creative, marketing, legal, finance, licensing, merchandising and other resources related to the development and physical production of content. Further, we may expand our content offering in a manner that is not well received by consumers. As we grow our operations, we may face integration and operational challenges as well as potential unknown liabilities and reputational concerns in connection with partners we work with or companies we may acquire or control. If we are not able to manage the growing complexity of our business, including improving, refining or revising our corporate culture as well as our systems and operational practices related to our streaming operations and original content, our business may be adversely affected.\n\n## If we fail to maintain or, in newer markets establish, a positive reputation concerning our service, including the content we offer, we may not be able to attract or retain members, and our operating results may be adversely affected.\n\nWe believe that a positive reputation concerning our service is important in attracting and retaining members. To the extent our content, in particular, our original programming, is perceived as low quality, offensive or otherwise not compelling to consumers, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted. To the extent our content is deemed controversial or offensive by government regulators, we may face direct or indirect retaliatory action or behavior, including being required to remove such content from our service, our entire service could be banned and/or become subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny across our business and operations. We could also face boycotts which could adversely affect our business. Furthermore, to the extent our response to government action or our marketing, customer service and public relations efforts are not effective or result in negative reaction, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may likewise be adversely impacted. With newer markets, we also need to establish our reputation with consumers and to the extent we are not successful in creating positive impressions, our business in these newer markets may be adversely impacted.\n\n## Our business could be adversely impacted by costs and challenges associated with strategic acquisitions and investments.\n\nFrom time to time, we acquire or invest in businesses, content, and technologies that support our business. The risks associated with such acquisitions or investments include the difficulty of integrating solutions, operations, and personnel; inheriting liabilities and exposure to litigation; failure to realize anticipated benefits and expected synergies; and diversion of management's time and attention, among other acquisition-related risks.\n\nWe may not be successful in overcoming such risks, and such acquisitions and investments may negatively impact our business. In addition, if we do not complete an announced acquisition transaction or integrate an acquired business successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition to the extent anticipated. Acquisitions and investments may contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly financial results. These fluctuations could arise from transaction-related costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or write-offs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions and investments, and could negatively impact our financial results.\n\n## We rely upon a number of partners to make our service available on their devices.\n\nWe currently offer members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internet-connected devices, including TVs, digital video players, TV set-top boxes and mobile devices. We have agreements with various cable, satellite and telecommunications operators to make our service available through the TV set-top boxes of these service providers, some of which compete directly with us or have investments in competing streaming content providers. In many instances, our agreements also include provisions by which the partner bills consumers directly for the Netflix service or otherwise offers services or products in connection with offering our service. If partners or other providers do a better job of connecting consumers with content they want to watch, for example through multi-service discovery interfaces, our service may be adversely impacted.

Meanwhile, Comcast's Studios segment recognizes content licensing revenue 'when the content is delivered and available for use' with approximately 'half year to 1 year of annual Studios content licensing revenue' remaining in deferred revenue at any given time.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\n## NBCUniversal Segments\n\n## Advertising\n\nMedia generates revenue from the sale of advertising on our television networks, Peacock and digital properties.\n\nWe enter into advertising arrangements with customers and have determined that a contract exists once all terms and conditions are agreed  upon,  typically  when  the  number  of  advertising  units  is  specifically  identified  and  the  timing  of  airing  is  scheduled. Advertisements are generally aired or viewed within one year once all terms are agreed upon. Revenue is recognized, net of agency commissions, in the period in which advertisements are aired or viewed and payment occurs thereafter, with payment generally required within 30 days. In some instances, we guarantee audience ratings for the advertisements. To the extent there is a shortfall in  contracts  where  the  ratings  were  guaranteed,  a  portion  of  the  revenue  is  deferred  until  the  shortfall  is  settled,  typically  by providing additional advertising units generally within one year of the original airing.\n\n## Distribution\n\nMedia  generates  revenue  from  the  distribution  of  cable  network  programming  in  the  United  States  and  internationally  to multichannel  video  providers,  including  both  traditional  providers  of  linear  programming  and  virtual  providers  who  provide streaming services for linear programming. Media also generates revenue from the fees received from multichannel video providers under NBC and Telemundo retransmission consent agreements and associated fees from NBC-affiliated and Telemundo-affiliated local  broadcast  television  stations. Additionally,  Media  generates  revenue  from  monthly  subscription  fees  received  from  certain Peacock subscribers.\n\nMonthly fees received under distribution agreements with multichannel video providers are generally under multiyear agreements and based on the number of subscribers. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include payment  within  60  days.  These  arrangements  are  accounted  for  as  licenses  of  functional  intellectual  property  and  revenue  is recognized as programming is provided on a monthly basis.\n\n## Content Licensing\n\nStudios generates revenue from the licensing of our owned film and television content in the United States and internationally to cable, broadcast and premium networks and to DTC streaming service providers, as well as through video on demand and pay-perview services. Media also generates revenue from licensing of our owned television content, which is reported in other revenue. Our agreements generally include fixed pricing and span multiple years. For example, following a film's theatrical release, Studios may license the exhibition rights of a film to different customers over multiple successive distribution windows.\n\nWe recognize revenue when the content is delivered and available for use by the licensee. When the term of an existing agreement is renewed or extended, we recognize revenue at the later of when the content is available or when the renewal or extension period begins. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although payments are generally collected over the license term. The amount  of  future  revenue  to  be  earned  related  to  fixed  pricing  under  existing  third-party  agreements  at  any  given  time  equals approximately one half year to 1 year of annual Studios content licensing revenue, which is the segment with the largest portion of this  future  revenue. The  majority  of  this  revenue  will  be  recognized  within  2  years. This  amount  may  fluctuate  from  period  to period depending on the timing of the releases and the availability of content under existing agreements and may not represent the total revenue expected to be recognized as it does not include revenue from future agreements or from variable pricing or optional purchases under existing agreements.\n\nFor our agreements that include variable pricing, such as pricing based on the number of subscribers to a DTC streaming service sold by our customers, we generally recognize revenue as our customers sell to their subscribers.\n\n## Theatrical\n\nStudios generates revenue from the worldwide theatrical release of produced and acquired films for exhibition in movie theaters. Our arrangements with exhibitors generally entitle us to a percentage of ticket sales. We recognize revenue as the films are viewed and exhibited in theaters and payment generally occurs within 30 days after exhibition.\n\n## Home Entertainment\n\nStudios generates revenue from the sale of our produced and acquired films on DVDs and through digital distribution services. Media also generates revenue from the sale of owned programming on DVDs and through digital distribution services, which is reported in other revenue. We generally recognize revenue from DVD sales, net of estimated returns and customer incentives, on the date that DVDs are delivered to and made available for sale by retailers. Payment terms generally include payment within 60 to 90 days from delivery to the retailer.",

The amount of principal and interest due in the next twelve months is $1,408 million. The amount of principal and interest due beyond the next twelve months is $18,638 million. As of December 31, 2021, no amounts had been borrowed under our $1 billion Revolving Credit Agreement. See Note 6 Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe anticipate that our future capital needs from the debt market will be more limited compared to prior years. Our ability to obtain this or any additional financing that we may choose to, or need to, obtain will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.\n\nIn March 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion of our common stock, with no expiration date. Stock repurchases may be effected through open market repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, privately-negotiated transactions, accelerated stock repurchase plans, block purchases, or other similar purchase techniques and in such amounts as management deems appropriate. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares, and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, general economic, business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities. We may discontinue any repurchases of our common stock at any time without prior notice. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has repurchased 1,182,410 shares of common stock for an aggregate amount of $600 million. As of December 31, 2021, $4.4 billion remains available for repurchases.\n\nOur primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, marketing programs, streaming delivery and personnel-related costs. Cash payment terms for non-original content are in line with the amortization period. Investments in original content, and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to licensed content. For example, production costs are paid as the content is created, well in advance of when the content is available on the service and amortized. We expect to continue to significantly increase our investments in global content, particularly in original content. We currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, available funds and access to financing sources, including our revolving credit facility, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months and beyond.\n\nOur material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations primarily relate to our content, debt and lease obligations. Expected timing of those payments are as follows:\n\n",

An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements and other production related commitments. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time we enter into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of these types of agreements. The contractual obligations table above does not include any estimated obligation for the unknown future titles, payment for which could range from less than one year to more than five years. However, these unknown obligations are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately $1 billion to $4 billion over the next three years, with the payments for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months. The foregoing range is based on considerable management judgments and the actual amounts may differ. Once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees, we include the amount in the contractual obligations table above.\n\n(2) Debt obligations include our Notes consisting of principal and interest payments. See Note 6 Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details.\n\n- (3) See Note 5 Balance Sheet Components in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details regarding leases. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has additional operating leases for real estate that have not yet commenced of $366 million which has been included above. Total lease obligations as of December 31, 2021 increased $677 million from $2,839 million as of December 31, 2020 to $3,516 million as of December 31, 2021 due to growth in facilities to support our growing headcount and growing number of original productions.\n\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2021, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $203 million, of which $39 million was classified in 'Other non-current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At this time, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made.\n\n## Free Cash Flow\n\nWe define free cash flow as cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and change in other assets. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make strategic acquisitions and investments and for certain other activities like share repurchases. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net income, operating income, cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nIn assessing liquidity in relation to our results of operations, we compare free cash flow to net income, noting that the major recurring differences are excess content payments over amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, non-cash remeasurement gain/loss on our euro-denominated debt, and other working capital differences. Working capital differences include deferred revenue, excess property and equipment purchases over depreciation, taxes and semi-annual interest payments on our outstanding debt.

      "answer": "Disney's financial planning for employee benefits is influenced by assumptions such as discount rates and long-term returns on plan assets, which are determined by yield curves of high-quality corporate bonds and expected returns on a diversified investment portfolio. These assumptions significantly affect the reported net periodic benefit costs and obligations. In contrast, Verizon assumes a healthcare cost trend rate of 7.30% for the next year, which is expected to gradually decline to 4.50% by 2032. This declining trend rate directly affects Verizon's long-term financial planning by projecting lower future healthcare costs, while Disney must account for higher uncertainty in returns due to its reliance on market-based assumptions. The difference in assumptions reflects contrasting strategies in managing future benefit obligations.",

      "question": "How does the shift in META's reporting methodology from ARPU to ARPP, combined with AT&T's increase in broadband ARPU due to promotional pricing, reflect contrasting strategies in leveraging revenue-per-user metrics to drive financial performance?",
      "answer": "META is shifting from reporting ARPU to ARPP starting in Q1 2024, indicating a strategic move to better reflect revenue generation across its broader Family of products (Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp), where users may engage with multiple platforms. This change aims to provide a more accurate representation of revenue per unique person rather than per user account. In contrast, AT&T experienced an increase in broadband ARPU in 2023 due to the expiration of prior-year promotional pricing, showing a direct financial benefit from pricing adjustments. While META focuses on refining metric accuracy to reflect multi-product engagement, AT&T leverages pricing strategy to boost per-customer revenue in its fiber broadband segment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from META_10k_2023.pdf - META will no longer report ARPU starting in Q1 2024 and will instead report ARPP, calculated based on daily active people (DAP), to better reflect revenue per unique person across its Family of products.",
        "Step 2: Extract from T_10k_2023.pdf - AT&T's broadband revenues increased in 2023 due to higher ARPU driven by the expiration of prior-year promotional pricing.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - META's shift to ARPP reflects a strategic move to align financial metrics with evolving user behavior across multiple platforms, while AT&T's ARPU increase demonstrates a pricing-driven strategy in its broadband business."

      "question": "How does the strategic importance of ARPU differ between Meta's Facebook user engagement model and AT&T's broadband revenue growth, based on their respective 2023 financial reporting?",
      "answer": "Meta uses ARPU as a key performance metric specifically tied to Facebook user engagement, where changes in DAUs and MAUs directly influence ad volume, ad value, and overall revenue. AT&T, on the other hand, reports that higher ARPU in broadband is driven by the end of prior-year promotional pricing, contributing to revenue growth amid a shift toward fiber customers. The strategic importance of ARPU for Meta lies in its direct link to user activity and advertising effectiveness, while for AT&T, it reflects pricing power and service value in a competitive telecom market.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, Meta defines ARPU as a key Facebook metric influenced by user engagement (DAUs and MAUs), which affects ad volume, value, and financial performance.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, AT&T reports that higher ARPU in broadband is a result of the conclusion of promotional pricing, contributing to overall revenue increases despite declines in legacy services.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While both companies report on ARPU, the underlying drivers and strategic implications differ: Meta ties ARPU to user engagement and advertising, whereas AT&T links it to pricing strategy and fiber adoption in a maturing broadband market."

META's ARPU growth was driven by increases across all geographic regions, particularly Europe (21%) and Rest of World (20%), despite user growth being concentrated in lower ARPU regions. AT&T's ARPU growth was specifically attributed to the impact of prior-year promotional pricing.

In contrast, GOOGL faces significant risks due to its reliance on advertising, which accounts for over 80% of its total revenue, including exposure to ad-blocking technologies, changing advertiser spending patterns, and intense competition.

RISK FACTORS\n\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described  below,  which  could  harm  our  business,  reputation,  financial  condition,  and  operating  results,  and  affect  the trading price of our Class A and Class C stock.\n\n## Risks Specific to our Company\n\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising, and reduced spending by advertisers, a loss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to customize ads could harm our business.\n\nWe generated more than 80% of total revenues from the display of ads online  in  2021.  Many  of  our  advertisers, companies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their contracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value (such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more effective monetization) than their  available  alternatives.  Changes  to  our  advertising  policies  and  data  privacy  practices,  as  well  as  changes  to other companies' advertising and/or data privacy practices have in the past, and may in the future, affect the advertising that  we  are  able  to  provide,  which  could  harm  our  business.  In  addition,  technologies  have  been  developed  that  make customized  ads  more  difficult  or  that  block  the  display  of  ads  altogether  and  some  providers  of  online  services  have integrated technologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third-party digital advertising. Failing to  provide  superior  value  or  deliver  advertisements  effectively  and  competitively  could  harm  our  reputation,  financial condition, and operating results.\n\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying  patterns.  Adverse  macroeconomic  conditions  have  affected,  and  may  in  the  future  affect,  the  demand  for advertising, resulting in fluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\n\nWe face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users, customers, and other partners, we may not remain competitive, which could harm our business and operating results.\n\nOur business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Our businesses face changing technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully, we must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services, and technologies in a timely manner. As our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services. We must continue to invest significant resources in R&amp;D, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance our technology and new and existing products and services.\n\nWe have many competitors in different industries. Our current and potential domestic and international competitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Some competitors have longer operating histories and well established relationships in various sectors. They can use their experience and resources in ways that could affect our competitive  position,  including  by  making  acquisitions,  continuing  to  invest  heavily  in  R&amp;D  and  in  talent,  aggressively initiating  intellectual  property  claims  (whether  or  not  meritorious),  and  continuing  to  compete  aggressively  for  users, advertisers,  customers,  and  content  providers.  Further,  discrepancies  in  enforcement  of  existing  laws  may  enable  our lesser  known  competitors  to  aggressively  interpret  those  laws  without  commensurate  scrutiny,  thereby  affording  them competitive advantages. Our competitors may also be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can or may foresee the need for products and services before us.\n\nOur  operating  results  may  also  suffer  if  our  products  and  services  are  not  responsive  to  the  needs  of  our  users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. As technologies continue to develop, our competitors may be able to offer experiences that are, or that are seen to be, substantially similar to or better than ours. This may force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources in order to remain competitive. If our competitors are more successful  than  we  are  in  providing  compelling  products  and  services  or  in  attracting  and  retaining  users,  advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers, our operating results could be harmed.\n\nOur  ongoing  investment  in  new  businesses,  products,  services,  and  technologies  is  inherently  risky,  and could divert management attention and harm our financial condition and operating results.",

      "question": "How does the reliance on advertising revenue, specifically the impact of unauthorized content distribution on ad effectiveness, differ between CMCSA and GOOGL based on their respective risk disclosures?",
      "answer": "CMCSA highlights that unauthorized reproduction and distribution of its content, particularly through digital piracy, negatively affects its ability to generate advertising revenue because it reduces the value of legitimate content distribution and increases enforcement costs. This is especially relevant for NBCUniversal and Sky, whose businesses are highly dependent on protecting intellectual property to maintain advertising revenue. In contrast, GOOGL's advertising revenue risk stems from external technologies that block or interfere with ad delivery, as well as advertiser spending cycles and competitive pressures, rather than content piracy. While both companies rely heavily on advertising revenue\u2014CMCSA through content-linked ads and GOOGL through online ad display\u2014their primary threats to ad revenue differ in nature: CMCSA is more vulnerable to content misappropriation, whereas GOOGL faces challenges related to ad-blocking technologies, shifting advertiser behavior, and intense competition in digital advertising.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - CMCSA identifies that unauthorized use of its content (e.g., piracy of NBCUniversal and Sky content) negatively affects its ability to generate revenue from advertising and increases enforcement costs.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - GOOGL states that over 80% of its revenue comes from online advertising and identifies risks including ad-blocking technologies, advertiser spending cycles, and competitive pressures.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While both companies are heavily reliant on advertising revenue, CMCSA's primary risk is tied to content piracy undermining the value of its intellectual property, whereas GOOGL's risks are more centered on digital ad delivery challenges and market competition."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others.\n\nWe  rely  on  our  intellectual  property,  such  as  patents,  copyrights,  trademarks  and  trade  secrets,  as  well  as  licenses  and  other agreements  with  our  vendors  and  other  third  parties,  to  use  various  technologies,  conduct  our  business  operations  and  sell  our products and services. Legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability, or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question, from importing into the United States or other jurisdictions in which we operate hardware or software that uses such intellectual property or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted. We may need to change our business practices if any of these events occur, which may limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming, costly to defend and may divert management's attention and resources away from our businesses. Moreover, if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from our vendors and other third parties on reasonable terms, our businesses could be adversely affected.\n\nIn  addition,  intellectual  property  constitutes  a  significant  part  of  the  value  of  NBCUniversal's  and  Sky's  businesses,  and  their success is highly dependent on protecting the intellectual property rights of the content they create or acquire against third-party misappropriation,  reproduction  or  infringement.  The  unauthorized  reproduction,  distribution  or  display  of  copyrighted  material negatively affects our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content, as well as from the sale of advertising in connection with our content, and increases our costs due to our active enforcement of our intellectual property rights.\n\nPiracy and other unauthorized uses of content are made easier, and the enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging, by technological advances that allow the conversion of programming, films and other content into digital formats, which facilitates the creation, transmission and sharing of high-quality unauthorized copies. In particular, piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution platforms continues to present challenges for NBCUniversal's businesses, and certain entities may stream our  broadcast  television  content  illegally  online  without  our  consent  and  without  paying  us  any  compensation.  It  also  presents similar challenges for Sky's businesses, including as a result of illegal retransmission of sports events. While piracy is a challenge in  the  United  States,  it  is  particularly  prevalent  in  many  parts  of  the  world  that  lack  developed  copyright  laws,  effective enforcement  of  copyright  laws  and  technical  protective  measures  like  those  in  effect  in  the  United  States.  If  any  U.S.  or international laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights are repealed or weakened or are not adequately enforced, or if the legal system fails to adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy, we may be unable to effectively protect our rights, the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights may increase.\n\n## We may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support.\n\nWe  depend  on  third-party  vendors  to  supply  us  with  a  significant  amount  of  the  hardware,  software  and  operational  support necessary to provide certain of our products and services. Some of these vendors represent our primary source of supply or grant us the  right  to  incorporate  their  intellectual  property  into  some  of  our  hardware  and  software  products.  While  we  monitor  the operations and financial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties, there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulties associated with these vendors or that we could effectively mitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties. For example, global supply chains in general have been, and may continue to be, disrupted as a result of COVID-19. If any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties or any other supply chain compliance-related  issues,  if  our  demand  exceeds  their  capacity  or  if  they  breach  or  terminate  their  agreements  with  us  or  are otherwise unable to meet our specifications or provide the equipment, products or services we need in a timely manner (or at all), or at reasonable prices, our ability to provide some products or services may be adversely affected and we may incur additional costs.\n\n## Our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments.\n\nOur success is, to a large extent, dependent on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and leverage new and existing technologies, and  our  competitors'  use  of  certain  types  of  technology  and  equipment  may  provide  them  with  a  competitive  advantage.  New technologies  can  materially  impact  our  businesses  in  a  number  of  ways,  including  affecting  the  demand  for  our  products,  the distribution methods of our products and content to our customers, the ways in which our customers can purchase and view our content  and  the  growth  of  distribution  platforms  available  to  advertisers.  For  example,  current  and  new  wireless  internet technologies  such  as  4G  and  5G  wireless  broadband  services  continue  to  evolve  rapidly  and  may  allow  for  greater  speed  and reliability for those services as compared with prior technologies. In addition, some companies and U.S. municipalities are building advanced fiber-based networks that provide very fast internet access speeds. We expect advances in communications technology to continue to occur in the future. If we choose technology or equipment that is not as effective or attractive to consumers as that employed by our competitors, if we fail to employ technologies desired by consumers before our competitors do so, or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiatives, our businesses and results of operations",

RISK FACTORS\n\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described  below,  which  could  harm  our  business,  reputation,  financial  condition,  and  operating  results,  and  affect  the trading price of our Class A and Class C stock.\n\n## Risks Specific to our Company\n\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising, and reduced spending by advertisers, a loss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to customize ads could harm our business.\n\nWe generated more than 80% of total revenues from the display of ads online  in  2021.  Many  of  our  advertisers, companies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their contracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value (such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more effective monetization) than their  available  alternatives.  Changes  to  our  advertising  policies  and  data  privacy  practices,  as  well  as  changes  to other companies' advertising and/or data privacy practices have in the past, and may in the future, affect the advertising that  we  are  able  to  provide,  which  could  harm  our  business.  In  addition,  technologies  have  been  developed  that  make customized  ads  more  difficult  or  that  block  the  display  of  ads  altogether  and  some  providers  of  online  services  have integrated technologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third-party digital advertising. Failing to  provide  superior  value  or  deliver  advertisements  effectively  and  competitively  could  harm  our  reputation,  financial condition, and operating results.\n\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying  patterns.  Adverse  macroeconomic  conditions  have  affected,  and  may  in  the  future  affect,  the  demand  for advertising, resulting in fluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\n\nWe face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users, customers, and other partners, we may not remain competitive, which could harm our business and operating results.\n\nOur business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Our businesses face changing technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully, we must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services, and technologies in a timely manner. As our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services. We must continue to invest significant resources in R&amp;D, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance our technology and new and existing products and services.\n\nWe have many competitors in different industries. Our current and potential domestic and international competitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Some competitors have longer operating histories and well established relationships in various sectors. They can use their experience and resources in ways that could affect our competitive  position,  including  by  making  acquisitions,  continuing  to  invest  heavily  in  R&amp;D  and  in  talent,  aggressively initiating  intellectual  property  claims  (whether  or  not  meritorious),  and  continuing  to  compete  aggressively  for  users, advertisers,  customers,  and  content  providers.  Further,  discrepancies  in  enforcement  of  existing  laws  may  enable  our lesser  known  competitors  to  aggressively  interpret  those  laws  without  commensurate  scrutiny,  thereby  affording  them competitive advantages. Our competitors may also be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can or may foresee the need for products and services before us.\n\nOur  operating  results  may  also  suffer  if  our  products  and  services  are  not  responsive  to  the  needs  of  our  users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. As technologies continue to develop, our competitors may be able to offer experiences that are, or that are seen to be, substantially similar to or better than ours. This may force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources in order to remain competitive. If our competitors are more successful  than  we  are  in  providing  compelling  products  and  services  or  in  attracting  and  retaining  users,  advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers, our operating results could be harmed.\n\nOur  ongoing  investment  in  new  businesses,  products,  services,  and  technologies  is  inherently  risky,  and could divert management attention and harm our financial condition and operating results.",

GOOGL reported a $2.3 billion fine and legal settlement for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was included in Corporate costs, unallocated. These differing treatments show that CMCSA excluded its settlement from performance metrics, while GOOGL's settlement was part of its corporate cost structure.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Adding the two figures gives a total of $2.477 billion in legal settlement-related expenses. However, the treatment of these expenses differs significantly: CMCSA explicitly excluded its $177 million adjustment from Adjusted EBITDA and segment results, while GOOGL included its $2.3 billion settlement in Corporate costs, which is not directly tied to segment performance."

      "answer": "Disney recorded $0.7 billion in non-cash impairment charges in fiscal 2024 related to content assets, among others, which reduces the carrying value of those assets and signals a decline in expected future cash flows, negatively impacting financial position. In contrast, Netflix monetizes content assets as a group rather than at the individual title level and amortizes them over time, with over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset amortized within four years. This group-level monetization approach allows Netflix to spread the cost of content over time and across its subscriber base, aligning amortization with viewing patterns and supporting a more stable cost of revenue structure.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nThe qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions and changes in projected future cash flows.\n\nThe quantitative assessment compares the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the ex cess. Fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.\n\nThe Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the Company's intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of the significant assets of an asset group to the carrying amount of the asset group. An asset group is generally established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses. If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset group and the carrying amount of the asset group. For assets held for sale, to the ex tent the carrying amount is greater than the asset's fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values.\n\nAs discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company recorded $1.5 billion of non-cash impairment charges related to the Star India Transaction in fiscal 2024 to reflect Star India at its estimated fair value less costs to sell.\n\nThe Company has investments in equity securities. For equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value, we consider forecasted financial performance of the investee companies, as well as volatility inherent in the ex ternal markets for these investments. If these forecasts are not met, impairment charges may be recorded.\n\nThe Company tested its indefinite-lived intangible assets, long-lived assets and investments for impairment and recorded non-cash impairment charges of $0.7 billion and $2.3 billion in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. The fiscal 2024 charges related to impairments of retail assets, content assets, and equity investments. The fiscal 2023 charges primarily related to content impairments resulting from a strategic change in our approach to content curation. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Allowance for Credit Losses\n\nWe evaluate our allowance for credit losses and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on historical bad debt experience, our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. In times of economic turmoil our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods. If our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and ex penses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, costs and ex penses may decrease in future periods. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\n\n## Contingencies and Litigation\n\nWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these proceedings. These estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and have been developed in consultation with outside counsel as appropriate. From time to time, we are also involved in other contingent matters for which we accrue estimates for a probable and estimable loss. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to legal proceedings or our assumptions regarding other contingent matters. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on litigation exposure.\n\n## Income Tax\n\nAs a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. Our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel, where appropriate, and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax  statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nShort-term investments are reviewed periodically for allowances for credit losses and impairment. When evaluating the investments, the Company reviews factors such as the extent to which the fair value of the security is less than the amortized cost basis, adverse conditions specifically related to the security, the financial condition of the issuer, the Company's intent to sell, and whether it would be more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the investments before the recovery of their amortized cost basis.\n\n## Content\n\nThe Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming, in order to offer members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fix ed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nThe Company recognizes content assets (licensed and produced) as 'Content assets, net' on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, the Company capitalizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, the Company capitalizes costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and production overhead.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, the Company amortizes the content assets (licensed and produced) in 'Cost of revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use over ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as the Company typically ex pects more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability. The Company reviews factors impacting the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis. The Company's estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company, or a third-party producing content on the Company's behalf, may qualify for tax incentives through eligible spend on productions. The accounting for tax incentives is dependent on the particular type of incentive, including the nature of the benefit and the location the incentive is earned. In general, tax  incentives are realized as cash receipts and may be received prior to or after a title launches on the Company's service. Upon a title's launch, any amounts the Company is eligible for through qualified production spend but has not received, are recognized in 'Other current assets' or 'Other non-current assets' on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as receivables. Tax incentives are generally accounted for as a reduction to the cost basis of the Company's content assets (presented in 'Content assets, net') and reduce content amortization over the life of the title (as presented in 'Cost of revenues') on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nThe Company's business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed in aggregate at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, the Company has not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nThe Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. In addition, uncertain tax  positions, tax -related valuation allowances and pre-acquisition contingencies are initially recorded in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date.\n\n## Property and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally up to 30 years, or the ex pected lease term for leasehold improvements, if applicable.\n\n## Trade Receivables\n\nTrade receivables primarily consist of membership and advertising fees due to the Company. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance for credit losses based on historical collection trends, the financial condition of its payment partners, and ex ternal market factors.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company's primary source of revenues is from monthly membership fees. Members are billed in advance of the start of their monthly membership and revenues are recognized ratably over each monthly membership period. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that",

      "answer": "Disney amortizes participations and residuals over the applicable product life cycle based on the ratio of current period revenues to estimated remaining total revenues for content predominantly monetized individually, while for group-monetized content, these costs are expensed in line with the pattern of usage. This reflects Disney's dual strategy of monetizing content either individually (e.g., theatrical films) or as part of a bundle (e.g., DTC subscriptions). Netflix, on the other hand, includes participations and residuals as part of its broader content production and licensing expenses, which are amortized as part of its content asset base, aligning with its primarily subscription-based DTC model. This implies that Disney's expense recognition for participations and residuals varies depending on the monetization model (individual vs. group), while Netflix's is more consistently tied to its streaming delivery and usage patterns.",

Revenue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to the non-monetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in income.\n\nFor local currency functional locations, assets and liabilities are translated at end-of-period rates while revenues and ex penses are translated at average rates in effect during the period. Equity is translated at historical rates and the resulting cumulative translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI).\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventory primarily includes vacation timeshare units, merchandise, food, materials and supplies. Carrying amounts of vacation ownership units are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Carrying amounts of merchandise, food, materials and supplies inventories are generally determined on a moving average cost basis and are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value.\n\n## Film and Television Content Costs\n\nThe Company classifies its capitalized produced and acquired/licensed content costs as long-term assets ('Produced and licensed content costs' in the Consolidated Balance Sheet) and classifies advances for live programming rights made prior to the live event as short-term assets ('Content advances' in the Consolidated Balance Sheet). For produced content, we capitalize all direct costs incurred in the physical production of a film, as well as allocations of production overhead and capitalized interest. For licensed and acquired content, we capitalize the license fee or acquisition cost, respectively. For purposes of amortization and impairment, the capitalized content costs are classified based on their predominant monetization strategy as follows:\n\n- Individual - lifetime value is predominantly derived from third-party revenues that are directly attributable to the specific film or television title (e.g. theatrical revenues or sales to third-party television programmers)\n- Group - lifetime value is predominantly derived from third-party revenues that are attributable only to a bundle of titles (e.g. subscription revenue for a DTC service or affiliate fees for a cable television network)\n\nThe determination of the predominant monetization strategy is made at commencement of production on a consolidated basis and is based on the means by which we derive third-party revenues from use of the content. Imputed title by title license fees that may be necessary for other purposes are established as required for those purposes.\n\nWe generally classify content that is initially intended for use on our DTC streaming services or Linear Networks as group assets. We generally classify content initially intended for theatrical release or for sale to third-party licensees as individual assets. The classification of content as individual or group only changes if there is a significant change to the title's monetization strategy relative to its initial assessment (e.g. content that was initially intended for license to a third party is instead used on an owned DTC service). When there is a significant change in monetization strategy, the title's capitalized content costs are tested for impairment.\n\nProduction costs for content that is predominantly monetized individually are amortized based upon the ratio of the current period's revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues). For film productions, Ultimate Revenues include revenues from all sources, which may include imputed license fees for content that is used on our DTC streaming services, that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial release for theatrical films. For episodic series that are classified as individual, Ultimate Revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years, including imputed license fees for content that is used on our DTC streaming services, from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later. Participations and residuals are ex pensed over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period's revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues for each production.\n\nProduction costs that are predominantly monetized as a group are amortized based on projected usage, generally resulting in an accelerated or straight-line amortization pattern. Adjustments to projected usage are applied prospectively in the period of the change. Participations and residuals are generally expensed in line with the pattern of usage.\n\nLicensed rights to film and television content and other programs for broadcast on our Linear Networks, domestic ESPN television network, International Sports Channels or DTC streaming services are expensed on an accelerated or straight-line basis over their useful life or over the number of times the program is expected to be aired, as appropriate. We amortize rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement. If annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season's estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season.",

In contrast, NFLX did not report specific impairment charges for content assets but instead emphasized a proactive amortization model based on viewing patterns and group-level monetization. This reveals that DIS experienced more direct write-downs of content value during the year, while NFLX manages content valuation risk through accelerated amortization and tax incentive strategies rather than discrete impairment events.

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nThe qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions and changes in projected future cash flows.\n\nThe quantitative assessment compares the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the ex cess. Fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.\n\nThe Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the Company's intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of the significant assets of an asset group to the carrying amount of the asset group. An asset group is generally established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses. If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset group and the carrying amount of the asset group. For assets held for sale, to the ex tent the carrying amount is greater than the asset's fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values.\n\nAs discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company recorded $1.5 billion of non-cash impairment charges related to the Star India Transaction in fiscal 2024 to reflect Star India at its estimated fair value less costs to sell.\n\nThe Company has investments in equity securities. For equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value, we consider forecasted financial performance of the investee companies, as well as volatility inherent in the ex ternal markets for these investments. If these forecasts are not met, impairment charges may be recorded.\n\nThe Company tested its indefinite-lived intangible assets, long-lived assets and investments for impairment and recorded non-cash impairment charges of $0.7 billion and $2.3 billion in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. The fiscal 2024 charges related to impairments of retail assets, content assets, and equity investments. The fiscal 2023 charges primarily related to content impairments resulting from a strategic change in our approach to content curation. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Allowance for Credit Losses\n\nWe evaluate our allowance for credit losses and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on historical bad debt experience, our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. In times of economic turmoil our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods. If our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and ex penses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, costs and ex penses may decrease in future periods. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\n\n## Contingencies and Litigation\n\nWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these proceedings. These estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and have been developed in consultation with outside counsel as appropriate.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n## Content\n\nWe acquire, license and produce content, including original programming, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fix ed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense.

The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as we typically ex pect more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability. We review factors that impact the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis. Our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\n\nIn the normal course of business, we, or a third-party producing content on our behalf, may qualify for tax incentives through eligible spend on productions. The accounting for tax incentives is dependent on the particular type of incentive, including the nature of the benefit and the location the incentive is earned. In general, tax  incentives are realized as cash receipts and may be received prior to or after a title launches on our service.

If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are ex pected to be, abandoned are written off.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax  bases as well as net operating loss and tax  credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax  assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not they will not be realized.\n\nAlthough we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax  assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, our forecast of future earnings and future tax able income, and prudent and feasible tax  planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in determining future tax able income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business.

      "answer": "Both DIS and NFLX highlight that variations in their operating results have a direct impact on their stock price volatility. DIS explains that changes in its operating results\u2014such as fluctuations in revenue from international theme parks due to geopolitical and regulatory factors like U.S. sanctions against Russia or new trade restrictions\u2014can lead to significant stock price swings. Additionally, uncertainty around compliance costs with evolving regulations, including privacy laws and AI-related policies, increases the unpredictability of their financial performance and stock behavior. For NFLX, variations in operating results\u2014such as membership acquisition and retention, content amortization estimates, and new revenue streams like advertising\u2014are cited as key drivers of stock volatility. External factors like competition, pricing strategies, and general market conditions further amplify this volatility. Internally, the company notes that forecasting inaccuracies in consumer adoption of new pricing models or content performance can lead to material differences between expected and actual results, which in turn affects investor sentiment and stock price.",

Some of these regulations include:\n\n- U.S. FCC regulation of our television and radio networks, our national programming networks and our owned television stations. See Item 1 - Federal Communications Commission Regulation.\n- Federal, state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations, including with respect to child safety. See Item 1 - Privacy and Data Protection Regulation.\n- Regulation of the safety and supply chain of consumer products and theme park operations, including regulation regarding the sourcing, importation and the sale of goods.\n- Land planning, use and development regulations applicable to our theme parks operations.\n- Environmental protection regulations.\n- U.S. and international anti-corruption laws, sanction programs, trade restrictions, anti-money laundering laws or currency controls.\n- Restrictions on the manner in which content is currently licensed and distributed, ownership restrictions or film or television content requirements, investment obligations or quotas. See Item 1 - International Content Regulation.\n- Domestic and international labor laws, tax laws and antitrust laws.\n\nNew laws and regulations, as well as changes in any of these current laws and regulations or regulator activities (or, if applicable, private litigation to enforce such laws and regulations) in any of these areas, or others, may require us to incur additional compliance costs, may restrict our ability to ex ecute on our business strategies as planned or offer products and services in ways that are profitable, and create an increasingly unpredictable regulatory landscape. In addition, ongoing and future developments in international political, trade and security policy may lead to new regulations limiting international trade and investment and disrupting our operations outside the U.S., including our international theme parks and resorts operations in France, mainland China and Hong Kong. For example, in 2022 the U.S. and other countries implemented a series of sanctions against Russia in response to events in Russia and Ukraine; U.S. agencies have enhanced trade restrictions, including new prohibitions on the importation of goods from certain regions and other jurisdictions are considering similar measures; and U.S. state governments have become more active in passing legislation targeted at specific sectors and companies and applying existing laws in novel ways to new technologies, including streaming and online commerce. Further the legal and regulatory landscape for certain new technologies, such as AI, is uncertain and evolving and our compliance obligations could increase our costs or limit how we may use these technologies in one or more of our businesses.\n\n## Our operations outside the U.S. are affected by the operation of laws in those jurisdictions.\n\nOur operations outside the U.S. are in many cases subject to the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate rather than, or in addition to, U.S. law. Laws in some international jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the U.S. These differences can affect our ability to react to changes in our business, and our rights or ability to enforce rights are sometimes different than would be ex pected under U.S. law. Moreover, enforcement of laws in some international jurisdictions can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which can affect both our ability to enforce our rights and to undertake activities that we believe are beneficial to our business. In addition, the business and political climate in some jurisdictions may encourage corruption, which could reduce our ability to compete successfully in those jurisdictions while remaining in compliance with local laws or U.S. anti-corruption laws applicable to our businesses. As a result, our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in non-U.S. jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if U.S. law alone governed these operations.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR STOCK\n\n## The price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile.\n\nThe price of our common stock has experienced substantial volatility and may continue to be volatile. Various factors have impacted, and may continue to impact, the price of our common stock, including, among others, changes in management; variations in our operating results; variations between our actual results and expectations of securities analysts; changes in our estimates, guidance or business plans; changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts; the activities, operating results or stock price of our competitors or other industry participants in the industries in which we operate; the announcement or completion of significant transactions by us or a competitor; events affecting the stock market generally; and the economic and political conditions in the U.S. and internationally, as well as other factors described in this Item 1A. Some of these factors may adversely impact the price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Further, volatility in the price of our common stock may negatively impact one or more of our businesses, including by increasing stock awards for our employees who participate in our stock incentive programs or limiting our financing options for acquisitions and other business expansion.",

Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.\n\nIn addition, a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our Amended and Restated Executive Severance and Retention Incentive Plan, thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction.\n\n## Our stock price is volatile.\n\nThe price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly. The price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following, some of which are beyond our control:\n\n- variations in our operating results, including our membership acquisition and retention, revenues, operating income, net income, net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow;\n- variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community;\n- announcements of developments affecting our business, systems or expansion plans by us or others;\n- competition, including the introduction of new competitors, their pricing strategies and services;\n- market volatility in general;\n- the level of demand for our stock, including the amount of short interest in our stock;\n- the impact of our current stock repurchase program and any future stock repurchase program we may adopt;\n- the operating results of our competitors; and\n- other risks and uncertainties described in these risk factors.\n\nAs a result of these and other factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price.\n\nFollowing certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities, we became the subject of securities litigation. We may ex perience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. This type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources.\n\n## Preparing and forecasting our financial results requires us to make judgments and estimates which may differ materially from actual results.\n\nGiven the dynamic nature of our business, and the inherent limitations in predicting the future, forecasts of our revenues, operating margins, net income and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results. Also, predicting consumer adoption of various pricing strategies, such as the adsupported subscription plan or efforts to limit multi-household usage, and new revenue streams, such as advertising revenue, is inherently difficult given the lack of operating history with respect to such offerings, and actual results may differ significantly from the ex pectations of our management, securities analysts or investors. Such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America also requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. We base such estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, but actual results may differ from these estimates. For example, we estimate the content amortization pattern, beginning with the month of first availability, of any particular licensed or produced television series, documentary or feature film based upon various factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the",

In contrast, Netflix follows an amortization policy where content assets are systematically expensed over time, with over 90% of licensed or produced content expected to be amortized within four years.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Critical Accounting E stimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n## Content\n\nWe acquire, license and produce content, including original programming, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fix ed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nWe recognize content assets (licensed and produced) as \"Content assets, net\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and production overhead.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in 'Cost of revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as we typically ex pect more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability. We review factors that impact the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis. Our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\n\nIn the normal course of business, we, or a third-party producing content on our behalf, may qualify for tax incentives through eligible spend on productions. The accounting for tax incentives is dependent on the particular type of incentive, including the nature of the benefit and the location the incentive is earned. In general, tax  incentives are realized as cash receipts and may be received prior to or after a title launches on our service. Upon a title's launch, any amounts we are eligible for through qualified production spend but have not received, are recognized in 'Other current assets' or 'Other non-current assets' on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as receivables. Tax incentives are generally accounted for as a reduction to the cost basis of content assets (presented in 'Content assets, net') and reduce content amortization over the life of the title (as presented in 'Cost of revenues') on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nOur business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are ex pected to be, abandoned are written off.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax  bases as well as net operating loss and tax  credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax  assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not they will not be realized.\n\nAlthough we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax  assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, our forecast of future earnings and future tax able income, and prudent and feasible tax  planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in determining future tax able income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business. Actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates.",

      "answer": "Disney's strategic changes in content distribution, such as the reorganization of media and entertainment operations into two segments and the removal of certain content from DTC platforms, have led to impairment charges and uncertainty in the profitability of DTC products.

Meanwhile, Meta's changes to its Feed display algorithms and the promotion of Reels, which monetizes at a lower rate than Feed and Stories, have led to reduced user engagement and financial results.

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nincluding through third-party licensees or sellers of our licensed goods and services. In addition, third-party suppliers provide products and services essential to the operation of a number of our businesses. A wide variety of factors could influence the success of those third parties and if negative factors significantly impacted a sufficient number of those third parties or materially impacted a supplier of a significant product or service, the profitability of one or more of our businesses could be adversely affected. In specific geographic markets, we have experienced delayed and/or partial payments from certain third parties due to liquidity issues.\n\nWe obtain insurance against the risk of losses relating to some of these events, generally including certain physical damage to our property and resulting business interruption, certain injuries occurring on our property and some liabilities for alleged breach of legal responsibilities. When insurance is obtained it is subject to deductibles, exclusions, terms, conditions and limits of liability. The types and levels of coverage we obtain vary from time to time depending on our view of the likelihood of specific types and levels of loss in relation to the cost of obtaining coverage for such types and levels of loss and we ex perience losses not covered by our insurance, which could be material.\n\n## We face risks related to changes in our business strategy, which have affected and may continue to affect our cost structure, the profitability of our businesses and/or the value of our assets.\n\nWe adjust our business strategies from time to time in connection with changes in senior management and in our efforts to respond to changes in technology, consumer purchasing and consumption patterns, acceptance of our entertainment offerings, the market for advertising, macroeconomic conditions and other changes in the business environment. For example, in fiscal 2024, we announced entering into a definitive agreement to transfer Star India into a joint venture and related impairment charges; in fiscal 2023, we reorganized our media and entertainment operations, which had been previously reported in one segment, into two segments, Entertainment and Sports; in fiscal 2023 we announced that we would review content, primarily on our DTC services, for alignment with a strategic change in our approach to content curation, resulting in removal of certain content from our platforms and related impairment charges; in fiscal 2022, we announced plans to introduce an ad-supported Disney+ service, new pricing model and price increases and cost realignment; and we have announced exploration of a number of new types of businesses. Changes in strategy, such as was the case with the most recent reorganization of our media and entertainment operations, can lead to workforce disruptions. Our new business strategies are, among other things, subject to execution risk and may not produce the anticipated benefits, such as supporting our growth strategies and enhancing shareholder value. For example, notwithstanding our continuing efforts to rationalize costs, the cost of executing on our DTC strategy may continue to grow or be reduced more slowly than anticipated, which may impact our distribution strategy across businesses/distribution platforms, the types of content we distribute through various businesses/distribution platforms, the timing and sequencing of content windows and ultimately, the profitability of our DTC products and other businesses/distribution platforms. Over the long term, our new organization and strategies could be less successful than our previous organizational structure and strategies.\n\nIn addition, changing technology, consumer purchasing patterns and acceptance of content offerings and macroeconomic conditions may impair the value of our assets. We incur costs in connection with changes to our business strategy and have needed and may in the future need to write-down the value of our assets. Among other assets, we have impaired the value of our content primarily at our DTC services and goodwill and intangible assets at our linear networks and impaired the value of certain of our retail store assets. We may write down other assets as our strategy evolves to account for the business environment.\n\nWe also make investments in existing or new businesses, including investments in international expansion of our business and in new business lines. For example, in fiscal 2024, we announced plans for additional expansion of our fleet of cruise ships, and in recent years to ex pand investment in our Ex periences segment. In addition, in recent years, we have made significant investments in our businesses, such as expansion and renovation of certain of our theme parks, additional cruise ships, the acquisition of TFCF Corporation (TFCF) and investments related to DTC offerings. The ultimate success of these investments is uncertain, some of these and future investments may ultimately result in returns that are negative or lower than anticipated, and these investments may impact the resources available to, and the profitability of, our other businesses. In addition, our costs increase in connection with these investments, such as additional ex penses incurred with the launch on new cruise ships, and we may have significant charges associated with the write-down of assets if the investments are not as successful as anticipated, as occurred in connection with the closure of Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser. Even if our strategies are effective in the long term, our new offerings will generally not be profitable in the short term, results of our new offerings are unlikely to be even quarter over quarter and we may not ex pand into new markets as or when anticipated. Our ability to forecast for new businesses is impacted by our lack of experience operating in those new businesses, speed with which the competitive landscape changes, volatility beyond our control (such as the events beyond our control noted above) and our ability to obtain or develop the content and rights on which our projections are based. Accordingly, we may not achieve our forecasted outcomes.",

From time to time, we also change the size, frequency, or relative prominence of ads as part of our product and monetization strategies. In addition, we have made, and we expect to continue to make, other changes to our products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of publishers, marketers, and developers, and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on our products. We also may introduce new features or other changes to existing products, or introduce new stand-alone products, that attract users away from properties, formats, or use cases where we have more proven means of monetization, such as our Feed products. In addition, as we focus on growing users and engagement across our family of products, from time to time these efforts have reduced, and may in the future reduce, engagement with one or more products and services in favor of other products or services that we monetize less successfully or that are not growing as quickly. For example, we plan to continue to promote Reels, which we expect will continue to monetize at a lower rate than our Feed and Stories products for the foreseeable future. These decisions may adversely affect our business and results of operations and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.\n\n## We may not be successful in our Reality Labs strategy and investments, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\n\nOur  Reality  Labs  efforts  include  our  metaverse  and  wearables  initiatives.  We  believe  the  metaverse,  an  embodied  internet  where  people  have  immersive experiences beyond two-dimensional screens, is the next evolution in social technology. In 2021, we announced a shift in our business and product strategy to focus on helping to bring the metaverse to life, and we are directing our efforts toward innovations in AI, wearables, and devices to help build next-generation interfaces. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative that will involve the development of new and emerging technologies, continued investment in infrastructure as well as privacy, safety, and security efforts, and collaboration with other companies, developers, partners, and other participants. However, the metaverse may not develop in accordance with our expectations, and market acceptance of features, products, or services we build is uncertain.  We regularly evaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as our understanding of the technological challenges and market landscape and our product ideas and designs evolve. In addition, we have relatively limited experience with consumer hardware products and virtual, augmented, and mixed reality technology, which may enable other companies to compete more effectively than us. We may be unsuccessful in our research and product development efforts, including if we are unable to develop relationships with key participants in the metaverse or develop products that operate effectively with metaverse technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. For example, some of our consumer hardware products depend on the ability to operate with third-party mobile platforms and these platforms do not necessarily provide our products with the same levels of interoperability that they provide to their own competing products. In addition, our Reality Labs efforts may also divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We expect to continue to make significant investments in virtual, augmented, and mixed reality and other technologies to support these efforts, and our ability to support these efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. In addition, as our Reality Labs efforts evolve, we may be subject to a variety of existing or new laws and regulations in the United States and international jurisdictions, including in the areas of privacy, safety, AI, competition, content regulation, tariffs, ex port controls, consumer protection, and e-commerce, which may delay or impede the development of our products and services, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, or otherwise harm our business. As a result of these or other factors, our Reality Labs strategy and investments may not be successful in the foreseeable future, or at all, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\n\n## If we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, our ability to maintain or expand our base of users, marketers, and developers may be impaired, and our business and financial results may be harmed.\n\nWe believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to maintaining and ex panding our base of users, marketers, and developers. Many of our new users are referred by existing users. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which we may not do successfully. We may introduce new products, terms of service, or policies that users do not like, which may negatively affect our brands. Additionally, the actions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using third-party applications integrated with our products or interacting with parties that advertise through our products. We will also continue to experience media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny of our actions or decisions regarding user privacy, data use, encryption, content, product design, algorithms, advertising, competition, generative AI, younger users, and other issues, including actions or decisions in connection with elections or geopolitical events, which has adversely affected, and",

In contrast, Meta discloses that content costs are part of its cost of revenue, which includes expenses for delivery and distribution of products, but does not specify a dollar amount for content production. Instead, Meta emphasizes revenue recognition tied to advertising impressions and user actions, suggesting that its content-related costs support a platform-based monetization model rather than direct content sales or licensing.",

Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\n\nSales commissions we pay in connection with contracts are expensed when incurred because the amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within marketing and sales on our consolidated statements of income. We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original ex pected length of one year or less.\n\nRevenue includes sales and usage-based taxes, except for cases where we are acting as a pass-through agent.\n\n## Advertising Revenue\n\nAdvertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken by our users.\n\nWe recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to users. We recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. In general, we report advertising revenue on a gross basis, since we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers.\n\nFor revenue generated from arrangements that involve third-parties, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report revenue on a gross basis, or the agent, and report revenue on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price.\n\nWe may accept lower consideration than the amount promised per the contract for certain revenue transactions and certain customers may receive cash-based incentives, credits, or refunds, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. We estimate these amounts and reduce revenue based on the amounts expected to be provided to customers.

The increase in impressions was due to Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar growth, in part reflecting the launches of the ad-supported Disney+ service domestically in December 2022 and internationally starting in November 2023 and airing more cricket programming on Disney+ Hotstar. There were two significant International Cricket Council (ICC) tournaments in the current year compared to one in the prior year.\n\n## Revenues - Other\n\nThe increase in other revenue was due to a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact.\n\n## Key Metrics\n\nIn addition to revenue, costs and operating income, management uses the following key metrics to analyze trends and evaluate the overall performance of Disney+, Disney+ Hotstar and Hulu, and we believe these metrics are useful to investors in analyzing the business: (1)\n\nPaid subscribers at:\n\n",

      "question": "Given that The Walt Disney Company reports advertising revenues as a significant service revenue stream and Alphabet (GOOGL) notes that shifts in advertising formats and device usage are affecting monetization trends and margins, how might these evolving advertising dynamics impact the relative growth and profitability of advertising revenues for both companies?",
      "answer": "The Walt Disney Company lists advertising revenues as a significant service revenue stream, indicating its importance to overall income. Alphabet highlights that shifts toward mobile and newer advertising formats have generally lower margins compared to traditional desktop search, and that changes in device mix, geographic reach, and AI-driven user behavior are affecting monetization trends. These dynamics suggest that while both companies benefit from advertising revenues, Alphabet faces margin pressures due to format and device shifts, which could constrain profitability growth. For Disney, if it relies heavily on traditional advertising formats, it may face challenges adapting to these same evolving dynamics, potentially limiting revenue growth unless it successfully transitions to newer, more competitive formats.",

This implies that evolving advertising dynamics may impact profitability for Alphabet more directly, while Disney may face growth constraints if it does not adapt to these same trends."

(1)\n\n## 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of The Walt Disney Company and its majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\nThe Company enters into relationships with or makes investments in other entities that may be variable interest entities (VIE). A VIE is consolidated in the financial statements if the Company has the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant (as defined by ASC 810-10-25-38) to the VIE. Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort (together, the Asia Theme Parks) are VIEs in which the Company has less than 50% equity ownership. Company subsidiaries (the Management Companies) have management agreements with the Asia Theme Parks, which provide the Management Companies, subject to certain protective rights of joint venture partners, with the ability to direct the day-to-day operating activities and the development of business strategies that we believe most significantly impact the economic performance of the Asia Theme Parks. In addition, the Management Companies receive management fees under these arrangements that we believe could be significant to the Asia Theme Parks. Therefore, the Company has consolidated the Asia Theme Parks in its financial statements.\n\n## Reporting Period\n\nThe Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30 and consists of fifty-two weeks with the exception that approximately every six years, we have a fifty-three week year. When a fifty-three week year occurs, the Company reports the additional week in the fourth quarter. Fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were fifty-two week years.\n\n## Reclassifications\n\nCertain reclassifications have been made in the fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 financial statements and notes to conform to the fiscal 2024 presentation.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and footnotes thereto. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\n\n## Revenues and Costs from Services and Products\n\nThe Company generates revenue from the sale of both services and tangible products and revenues and operating costs are classified under these two categories in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Certain costs related to both the sale of services and tangible products are not specifically allocated between the service or tangible product revenue streams but are instead attributed to the principal revenue stream. The cost of services and tangible products exclude depreciation and amortization.\n\nSignificant service revenues include:\n\n- Subscription fees to our DTC streaming services\n- Affiliate fees\n- Advertising revenues\n- Admissions to our theme parks, charges for room nights at hotels and sales of cruise vacation packages\n- Revenue from the licensing and distribution of film and television properties\n- Royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods, published materials and in multi-platform games",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nPlease read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with 'Note about Forward-Looking Statements,' Part I, Item 1 \"Business,\" Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors,\" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe following section generally discusses 2024 results compared to 2023 results.  Discussion of 2023 results compared to 2022 results to the extent not included in this report can be found in Item 7 of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Understanding Alphabet's Financial Results\n\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses - the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google Serv ices and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectiv ely as Other Bets. For further details on our segments, see Part I, Item 1 Business and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect\n\nThe following long-term trends hav e contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate that they will continue to affect our future results:\n\n- Users' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves.\n\nThe continuing ev olution of the online world has contributed to the growth of our business and our rev enues since inception. We expect that this evolution will continue to benefit our business and our rev enues, although at a slower pace than we hav e experienced historically. In addition, we face increasing competition for user engagement and adv ertisers, including from other dev elopers and prov iders of AI products and serv ices, which may affect our rev enues.\n\n## \u00b7 Users continue to access our products and services using diverse devices and modalities, which allows for new advertising formats that may benefit our revenues but adversely affect our margins.\n\nOur  users  are  accessing  our  products  and  serv ices  v ia  div erse  dev ices  and  modalities  beyond  traditional  desktop,  such  as  smartphones, wearables, connected TVs, and smart home devices, and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or what they are doing. We are focused on expanding our products and serv ices to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and grow our business.\n\nWe benefit from adv ertising rev enues generated from different channels, including mobile, and newer adv ertising formats. T he margins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search. Additionally, as the market for a particular dev ice type or modality matures, our adv ertising rev enues may be affected. For example, changing dynamics within the global smartphone market, such as increased market saturation in dev eloped countries, can affect our mobile adv ertising rev enues.\n\nWe expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our rev enues grow and TAC as a percentage of our advertising rev enues (\"TAC rate\") to be affected by changes in dev ice mix; geographic mix; partner agreement terms; partner mix; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product mix; the relativ e rev enue growth rates of adv ertising rev enues from different channels; and rev enue share terms.\n\nWe expect these trends to continue to affect our rev enues and put pressure on our margins.\n\n- As online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings, which may affect our monetization.\n\nAs interactions between users and adv ertisers change, and as online user behav ior ev olv es, for example with AI, we continue to expand our product offerings  to  serv e  these  changing  needs,  which  may  affect  monetization  of  our  products  and  serv ices.  We  expect  to  continue  to  incorporate  AI innov ations into our products, such as AI in Search, that could affect our monetization trends. When dev eloping new products and serv ices we generally focus first on user experience and then on monetization.\n\n- As users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets continue to increase, and may require continued investments. In addition, movements in foreign exchange rates affect such revenues.\n\nThe shift to online, as well as the adv ent of the multi-dev ice world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S., including in emerging markets, such as India.  We continue to inv est heav ily and dev elop localized v ersions of our products and adv ertising programs relev ant to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased",

These revenues are tied to traditional television broadcasting and promotional services. In contrast, GOOGL generates advertising revenues predominantly through digital platforms such as Google Search, YouTube, and Google Network properties, leveraging both performance and brand advertising models. Revenues are recognized either when a user engages with performance ads or when brand ads are displayed.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Nature of Operations\n\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\n\nWe generate revenues by deliv ering relev ant, cost-effectiv e online adv ertising; cloud-based solutions that prov ide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure, platform serv ices, and applications; sales of other products and serv ices, such as fees receiv ed for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and dev ices.\n\n## Basis of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the v ariable interest and v oting models. Intercompany balances and transactions hav e been eliminated.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported  and  disclosed  in  the  financial  statements  and  the  accompanying  notes. Actual  results  could  differ  materially  from  these  estimates  due  to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we ev aluate our estimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; contingent liabilities; fair v alues of financial instruments and goodwill; income taxes; inv entory; and useful liv es of property and equipment, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believ ed to be reasonable, and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying v alues of assets and liabilities.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or serv ices is transferred to our customers, and the collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or serv ices is probable. Sales and other similar taxes are excluded from rev enues.\n\n## Advertising Revenues\n\nWe generate advertising rev enues primarily by deliv ering adv ertising on:\n\n- Google  Search  and  other  properties,  including  rev enues  from  traffic  generated  by  search  distribution  partners  who  use  Google.com  as  their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n- YouTube properties; and\n- Google Network properties, including rev enues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\n\nOur  customers  generally  purchase  adv ertising  inv entory  through  Google Ads,  Google Ad  Manager,  Google  Display  &amp;  Video  360,  and  Google Marketing Platform, among others.\n\nWe offer adv ertising by deliv ering both performance and brand adv ertising. We recognize rev enues for performance adv ertising when a user engages with the adv ertisement. For brand adv ertising, we recognize rev enues when the ad is displayed, or a user v iews the ad.\n\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we ev aluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report rev enues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report rev enues on a net basis). Generally, we report adv ertising rev enues for ads placed on Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as rev enues, and amounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of rev enues. Where we are the principal,  we  control  the  adv ertising  inv entory  before  it  is  transferred  to  our  customers.  Our  control  is  ev idenced  by  our  sole  ability  to  monetize  the advertising inv entory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers and hav ing a lev el of discretion in establishing pricing.\n\n## Google Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices\n\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and dev ices rev enues consist of rev enues from:",

A VIE is consolidated in the financial statements if the Company has the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant (as defined by ASC 810-10-25-38) to the VIE. Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort (together, the Asia Theme Parks) are VIEs in which the Company has less than 50% equity ownership. Company subsidiaries (the Management Companies) have management agreements with the Asia Theme Parks, which provide the Management Companies, subject to certain protective rights of joint venture partners, with the ability to direct the day-to-day operating activities and the development of business strategies that we believe most significantly impact the economic performance of the Asia Theme Parks. In addition, the Management Companies receive management fees under these arrangements that we believe could be significant to the Asia Theme Parks. Therefore, the Company has consolidated the Asia Theme Parks in its financial statements.\n\n## Reporting Period\n\nThe Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30 and consists of fifty-two weeks with the exception that approximately every six years, we have a fifty-three week year. When a fifty-three week year occurs, the Company reports the additional week in the fourth quarter. Fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were fifty-two week years.\n\n## Reclassifications\n\nCertain reclassifications have been made in the fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 financial statements and notes to conform to the fiscal 2024 presentation.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and footnotes thereto. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\n\n## Revenues and Costs from Services and Products\n\nThe Company generates revenue from the sale of both services and tangible products and revenues and operating costs are classified under these two categories in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Certain costs related to both the sale of services and tangible products are not specifically allocated between the service or tangible product revenue streams but are instead attributed to the principal revenue stream. The cost of services and tangible products exclude depreciation and amortization.\n\nSignificant service revenues include:\n\n- Subscription fees to our DTC streaming services\n- Affiliate fees\n- Advertising revenues\n- Admissions to our theme parks, charges for room nights at hotels and sales of cruise vacation packages\n- Revenue from the licensing and distribution of film and television properties\n- Royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods, published materials and in multi-platform games",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Nature of Operations\n\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\n\nWe generate revenues by deliv ering relev ant, cost-effectiv e online adv ertising; cloud-based solutions that prov ide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure, platform serv ices, and applications; sales of other products and serv ices, such as fees receiv ed for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and dev ices.\n\n## Basis of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the v ariable interest and v oting models. Intercompany balances and transactions hav e been eliminated.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported  and  disclosed  in  the  financial  statements  and  the  accompanying  notes. Actual  results  could  differ  materially  from  these  estimates  due  to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we ev aluate our estimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; contingent liabilities; fair v alues of financial instruments and goodwill; income taxes; inv entory; and useful liv es of property and equipment, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believ ed to be reasonable, and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying v alues of assets and liabilities.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or serv ices is transferred to our customers, and the collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or serv ices is probable. Sales and other similar taxes are excluded from rev enues.\n\n## Advertising Revenues\n\nWe generate advertising rev enues primarily by deliv ering adv ertising on:\n\n- Google  Search  and  other  properties,  including  rev enues  from  traffic  generated  by  search  distribution  partners  who  use  Google.com  as  their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n- YouTube properties; and\n- Google Network properties, including rev enues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\n\nOur  customers  generally  purchase  adv ertising  inv entory  through  Google Ads,  Google Ad  Manager,  Google  Display  &amp;  Video  360,  and  Google Marketing Platform, among others.\n\nWe offer adv ertising by deliv ering both performance and brand adv ertising. We recognize rev enues for performance adv ertising when a user engages with the adv ertisement. For brand adv ertising, we recognize rev enues when the ad is displayed, or a user v iews the ad.\n\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we ev aluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report rev enues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report rev enues on a net basis). Generally, we report adv ertising rev enues for ads placed on Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as rev enues, and amounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of rev enues. Where we are the principal,  we  control  the  adv ertising  inv entory  before  it  is  transferred  to  our  customers.  Our  control  is  ev idenced  by  our  sole  ability  to  monetize  the advertising inv entory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers and hav ing a lev el of discretion in establishing pricing.\n\n## Google Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices\n\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and dev ices rev enues consist of rev enues from:",

      "answer": "Netflix expects to incur between $1 billion and $4 billion in future content licensing obligations over the next three years, primarily after the first twelve months. This compares to Comcast's Studios segment, which typically has future revenue visibility from existing licensing agreements equal to approximately one-half year to one year of annual Studios content licensing revenue. Thus, while Netflix's obligations are forward-looking and not yet fixed, they represent a significant multi-year financial commitment that is expected to be recognized over time, similar to Comcast\u2019s revenue recognition pattern from licensing content over a 1\u20132 year horizon.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_b (NFLX), extract that Netflix expects $1 billion to $4 billion in future content licensing obligations over the next three years, with most payments occurring after the first twelve months.",

      "answer": "Comcast's Studios segment generates revenue by licensing owned film and television content to DTC streaming providers like Netflix, with agreements that include fixed pricing spanning multiple years and variable pricing based on subscriber counts. This licensing model contributes to the broader market dynamics where content providers seek to maximize revenue from their intellectual property. As a result, Netflix faces increased competition for exclusive content rights and rising programming costs, which can negatively impact its ability to maintain a cost-efficient and compelling mix of programming. The financial pressure from such licensing arrangements may lead to higher expenses for Netflix, affecting its strategy to balance member satisfaction and cost efficiency.",

      "question": "How does the increasing trend of content owners delivering content directly to consumers impact both CMCSA's licensing revenue and NFLX's content acquisition costs, and what specific business offerings from each company are affected by this shift?",
      "answer": "The trend of content owners delivering content directly to consumers negatively affects CMCSA's licensing revenue because it reduces the quantity and quality of content licensed to CMCSA\u2019s linear television networks or Peacock, which in turn impacts their ability to generate licensing fees from third parties. For NFLX, this trend increases content acquisition costs as competition for popular content intensifies, especially when content providers launch their own DTC platforms and no longer license content to NFLX. CMCSA's Peacock and NFLX's streaming service are both directly affected by this shift, as they must adapt to fewer licensing opportunities and rising programming costs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - CMCSA_10k_2023.pdf:page_24:chunk_1: 'As more content owners offer their content directly to consumers through their own platforms, they may reduce the quantity and quality of the content they license to our linear television networks or Peacock.'",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - NFLX_10k_2023.pdf:page_10:chunk_1: 'As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies.'",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are impacted by the same industry shift: CMCSA loses licensing revenue from third-party content owners keeping content in-house, while NFLX faces higher costs and reduced availability of licensed content. Both are adapting through their own DTC platforms: Peacock and Netflix streaming."

DIS reports both the cross currency swaps and the offsetting gains on the hedged borrowings, resulting in a net zero effect on earnings. Similarly, T reports both the loss on cross-currency swaps and the offsetting gain on long-term debt, also resulting in a net neutral impact on earnings.

AT&T also uses 'Ultimate Revenues' for amortization but applies it to both individual and group monetized content, with a similar 10-year estimation period. However, AT&T places greater emphasis on the fair value of programming and subscription revenue projections, especially for streaming and OTT services.

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Amortization of Production Costs\n\nAs described in Note 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements and disclosed by management, capitalized film and television production costs are amortized based on whether the content is predominantly monetized individually or as a group. Production costs for content that is predominantly monetized individually is amortized based upon the ratio of the current period's revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues). For film productions, Ultimate Revenues include revenues from all sources, which may include imputed license fees for content that is used by the Company's DTC streaming services, that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial release for theatrical films. For episodic television series, Ultimate Revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years, including imputed license fees for content that is used on the Company's DTC streaming services, from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later. Production costs that are predominantly monetized as a group are amortized based on projected usage (which may be, for example, derived from historical viewership patterns), typically resulting in an accelerated or straight-line amortization pattern. For the year ended October 1, 2022, the Company recognized $10,224 million of amortization of produced content costs, which is primarily included in 'Cost of services' in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to amortization of production costs is a critical audit matter are the significant auditor effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence used in the amortization calculation for production costs monetized individually and as a group, and management's estimates of Ultimate Revenues and projected usage.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to amortization of production costs, including controls over the estimation of Ultimate Revenues and projected usage. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management's process for determining the amortization of production costs, (ii) evaluating whether ultimate revenues for certain content titles were reasonable considering information such as past performance of comparable titles, future firm commitments to license programs, and current market trends, (iii) evaluating the accelerated amortization pattern for content predominately monetized as a group, and (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the amortization calculation for certain titles and for historical viewership data used to calculate the estimate of projected usage for certain groups.\n\n## /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\nLos Angeles, California November 29, 2022\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1938.",

For networks that generate both advertising and subscription revenues, the net realizable value of unamortized programming costs is generally evaluated based on the network's programming taken as a whole. In assessing whether the programming inventory for a particular advertisingsupported network is impaired, the net realizable value for all of the network's programming inventory is determined based on a projection of the network's profitability. This assessment would occur upon the occurrence of certain triggering events. Similarly, for premium pay television, streaming and OTT services that are not advertising-supported, an evaluation of the fair value of unamortized programming costs is performed based on services' licensed programming taken as a whole. Specifically, the fair value for all premium pay television, streaming and OTT service licensed programming is determined based on projections of estimated subscription revenues less certain costs of delivering and distributing the licensed programming. Changes in management's intended usage of a specific program, such as a decision to no longer exhibit that program and forgo the use of the rights associated with the program license, results in a reassessment of that program's fair value, which could result in an impairment (see Note 11).\n\nFilm and Television Production Cost Recognition, Participations and Residuals and Impairments Film and television production costs on our consolidated balance sheets include the unamortized cost of completed theatrical films and television episodes, theatrical films and television series in production and undeveloped film and television rights. Film and television production costs are stated at the lower of cost, less accumulated amortization, or fair value. For films and television programs predominantly monetized individually, the amount of capitalized film and television production costs and the amount of participations and residuals to be recognized as broadcast, programming and operations expenses for a given film or television series in a particular period are determined using the film forecast computation method. Under this method, the amortization of capitalized costs and the accrual of participations and residuals are based on the proportion of the film's (or television program's) revenues recognized for such period to the film's (or television program's) estimated remaining ultimate revenues (i.e., the total revenue to be received throughout a film's (or television program's) life cycle).\n\nThe process of estimating a film's ultimate revenues requires us to make a series of judgments related to future revenue-generating activities associated with a particular film. We estimate the ultimate revenues, less additional costs to be incurred (including exploitation and participation costs), in order to determine whether the value of a film or television series is impaired and requires an immediate write-off of unrecoverable film and television production costs. To the extent that the ultimate revenues are adjusted, the resulting gross margin reported on the exploitation of that film or television series in a period is also adjusted. (See Note 11)\n\nPrior to the theatrical release of a film, our estimates are based on factors such as the historical performance of similar films, the star power of the lead actors, the rating and genre of the film, pre-release market research (including test market screenings), international distribution plans and the expected number of theaters in which the film will be released. In the absence of revenues directly related to the exhibition of owned film or television programs on our television networks, premium pay television, streaming or OTT services, we estimate a portion of the unamortized costs that are representative of the utilization of that film or television program in that exhibition and expense such costs as the film or television program is exhibited. The period over which ultimate revenues are estimated generally does not exceed ten years from the initial release of a motion picture or from the date of delivery of the first episode of an episodic television series. Estimates were updated based on information available during the film's production and, upon release, the actual results of each film.\n\nFor a film (or television program) predominantly monetized as part of a film (or television program) group, the amount of capitalized film and television production costs is amortized using a reasonably reliable estimate of the portion of unamortized film costs that is representative of the use of the film. Production costs are expensed as the film (or television program) is exhibited or exploited.\n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, except for assets acquired using acquisition accounting, which are initially recorded at fair value (see Note 7). The cost of additions and substantial improvements to property, plant and equipment is capitalized, and includes internal compensation costs for these projects. The cost of maintenance and repairs of property, plant and equipment is charged to operating expenses. Property, plant and equipment costs are depreciated using straight-line methods over their estimated economic lives. Certain subsidiaries follow composite group depreciation methodology. Accordingly, when a portion of their depreciable property, plant and equipment is retired in the ordinary course of business, the gross book value is reclassified to accumulated depreciation, and no gain or loss is recognized on the disposition of these assets.",

      "question": "How do Disney's challenges with managing churn rates on its DTC platforms due to pricing model changes and economic pressures compare to AT&T's success in reducing churn through bundling strategies, and what does this reveal about the differing competitive dynamics in their respective industries?",
      "answer": "Disney faces significant challenges in managing churn rates on its DTC platforms, particularly in response to price increases and economic downturns, which can reduce consumer willingness to pay for streaming services. In contrast, AT&T has successfully reduced churn by bundling services, with subscribers purchasing two or more services experiencing significantly lower churn than single-service subscribers. This comparison reveals that the streaming industry faces more price sensitivity and subscriber volatility due to a crowded market and economic pressures, whereas the telecom industry benefits from integrated service offerings that enhance customer retention. The competitive dynamics differ in that Disney must balance price increases with subscriber retention amid rising competition and economic uncertainty, while AT&T leverages its 5G network and bundled plans to maintain subscriber loyalty in a more mature, saturated market.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From Disney's 10-K, extract that economic downturns negatively impact subscriber retention and that pricing model changes (e.g., Disney+ ad-supported tier and price increases) affect churn rates.",

        "Step 4: Synthesize how these differences reflect the broader competitive dynamics: Disney must navigate economic pressures and pricing constraints, whereas AT&T leverages network capabilities and bundling to stabilize churn."

As a result, our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in non-U.S. jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if U.S. law alone governed these operations.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance matters and any related reporting obligations may impact our businesses.\n\nU.S. and international regulators, investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters. For example, new domestic and international laws and regulations relating to ESG matters, including human capital, diversity, sustainability, climate change and cybersecurity, are under consideration or being adopted, which may include specific, target-driven disclosure requirements or obligations. Our response will require additional investments and implementation of new practices and reporting processes, all entailing additional compliance risk. In addition, we have announced a number of ESG initiatives and goals, which will require ongoing investment, and there is no assurance that we will achieve any of these goals or that our initiatives will achieve their intended outcomes. Consumers' perceptions of our efforts to achieve these goals often differ widely and present risks to our reputation and brands. In addition, our ability to implement some initiatives or achieve some goals is dependent on external factors. For example, our ability to meet certain sustainability goals or initiatives may depend in part on third-party collaboration, mitigation innovations and/or the availability of economically feasible solutions at scale.\n\n## Damage to our reputation or brands may negatively impact our Company across businesses and regions.\n\nOur reputation and globally recognizable brands are integral to the success of our businesses. Because our brands engage consumers across our businesses, damage to our reputation or brands in one business may have an impact on our other businesses. Because some of our brands are globally recognized, brand damage may not be locally contained. Maintenance of the reputation of our Company and brands depends on many factors including the quality of our offerings, maintenance of trust with our customers and our ability to successfully innovate. In addition, we may pursue brand or product integration combining previously separate brands or products targeting different audiences under one brand or pursue other business initiatives inconsistent with one or more of our brands, and there is no assurance that these initiatives will be accepted by our customers and not adversely impact one or more of our brands. Significant negative claims or publicity regarding the Company or its operations, products, management, employees, practices, business partners, business decisions, social responsibility and culture may materially damage our brands or reputation, even if such claims are untrue. Damage to our reputation or brands could impact our sales, business opportunities, profitability, recruiting and valuation of our securities.\n\n## Various risks may impact the success of our DTC business.\n\nWe may not successfully execute on our DTC strategy. The success of our DTC strategy and profitability of our DTC businesses will be impacted by the success of our efforts to reorganize DMED to advance our DTC strategies, drive subscriber additions and retention based on the attractiveness of our content, manage churn in reaction to price increases, achieve the desired financial impact of the Disney+ ad supported service, pricing model and price increases, our ability to execute on cost realignment and the effects of our determinations with regard to distribution for our creative content across windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation, and allocation of programming and production costs is driven by distribution of the relevant content across windows. Accordingly, our distribution determinations impact the costs of each business/distribution channel, including DTC. An increasing number of competitors have entered DTC businesses. Consumers may not be willing to pay for an expanding set of DTC streaming services at increasing prices, potentially exacerbated by an economic downturn. In addition, economic downturns negatively impact the purchase of and price for advertising on our DTC streaming services. We face competition for creative talent and may not be successful in recruiting and retaining talent, or may face increased costs to do so. Our content may not successfully attract and retain subscribers in the quantities that we expect. Our content is subject to cost pressures and may cost more than we expect. We may not successfully manage our costs to meet our profitability goals. Government regulation, including revised foreign content and ownership regulations, may impact the implementation of our DTC business plans. The highly competitive environment in which we operate puts pricing pressure on our DTC offerings and may require us to lower our prices or not take price increases to attract or retain customers or experience higher churn rates. These and other risks may impact the profitability and success of our DTC businesses.\n\n## Potential credit ratings actions, increases in interest rates, or volatility in the U.S. and global financial markets could impede access to, or increase the cost of, financing our operations and investments.\n\nOur borrowing costs have been, and can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent ratings agencies that are based, in part, on the Company's performance as measured by credit metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios. As a result of the financial impact of COVID-19 on our businesses, Standard and Poor's downgraded our longterm debt ratings by two notches to BBB+ and downgraded our short-term debt ratings by one notch to A-2. Fitch downgraded our long- and short-term credit ratings by one notch to A- and F2, respectively. As of October 1, 2022 Moody's Investors Service's long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1 (Stable), respectively, Standard and Poor's long- and shortterm debt ratings for the Company were BBB+ and A-2 (Positive), respectively, and Fitch's long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A- and F2 (Stable), respectively. These ratings actions have increased, and any potential future",

We believe 5G opens up vast possibilities of connecting sensors, devices, and autonomous things, commonly referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT). More and more, these devices are performing use cases that require high bandwidth, ultra-reliability and low latency that only 5G and edge computing can bring. To support higher mobile data usage, our priority is to best utilize a wireless network that has sufficient spectrum and capacity to support these innovations on as broad a geographic basis as possible. In January 2022, we began to deploy our C-band spectrum acquired in FCC Auction 107 (see Note 6).\n\nTo attract and retain subscribers in a mature and highly competitive market, we have launched a wide variety of plans, including our FirstNet and prepaid products, and arrangements that bundle our services. Virtually all of our postpaid smartphone subscribers are on plans that provide for service on multiple devices at reduced rates, and subscribers to such plans tend to have higher retention and lower churn rates. We offer unlimited data plans and subscribers to such plans also tend to have higher retention and lower churn rates. Our offerings are intended to encourage existing subscribers to upgrade their current services and/or add devices, attract subscribers from other providers and/or minimize subscriber churn. Subscribers that purchase two or more services from us have significantly lower churn than subscribers that purchase only one service.\n\n## Business Wireline Results\n\n",

        "Step 2: From VZ's 10-K filing, extract the 2023 Federal current tax provision of $2,070 million and the Federal deferred tax provision of $1,799 million, totaling $3,869 million in total Federal tax provision.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the combined Federal tax provision: $441.41 million (NFLX) + $3,869 million (VZ) = $4,310.41 million.",
        "Step 4: Extract NFLX's total income tax provision of $797,415 thousand ($797.415 million) and VZ's total income tax provision of $4,892 million for 2023.",
        "Step 5: Calculate the percentage of Federal tax provision relative to total tax provision: NFLX = $441.41M / $797.415M = 55.4%, and VZ = $3,869M / $4,892M = 79.1%.",
        "Step 6: Adjust the final question to focus on the combined Federal tax provision and its relationship to each company's total tax provision, rather than a direct comparison between the two companies."

          "chunk_text": "## AT&amp;T Inc.\n\n## ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nWe are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. These risks, along with other business risks, impact our cost of capital. It is our policy to manage our debt structure and foreign ex change ex posure in order to manage capital costs, control financial risks and maintain financial flex ibility over the long term. In managing market risks, we employ derivatives according to documented policies and procedures, including interest rate swaps, interest rate locks, foreign currency ex change contracts and combined interest rate foreign currency contracts (cross-currency swaps). We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. We do not foresee significant changes in the strategies we use to manage market risk in the near future.\n\nOne of the most significant assumptions used in estimating our postretirement benefit obligations is the assumed weighted-average discount rate, which is the hypothetical rate at which the projected benefit obligations could be effectively settled or paid out to participants. We determined our discount rate based on a range of factors, including a yield curve composed of the rates of return on several hundred high-quality, fix ed income corporate bonds available at the measurement date and corresponding to the related expected durations of future cash outflows for the obligations. In recent years, the discount rates have been increasingly volatile, and on average have been lower than in historical periods. Lower discount rates used to measure our pension and postretirement plans result in higher obligations. Future increases in these rates could result in lower obligations, improved funded status and actuarial gains.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nThe majority of our financial instruments are medium- and long-term fixed-rate notes and debentures. Changes in interest rates can lead to significant fluctuations in the fair value of these instruments. The principal amounts by expected maturity, average interest rate and fair value of our liabilities that are ex posed to interest rate risk are described in Notes 11 and 12. In managing interest expense, we control our mix of fix ed- and floating-rate debt through term loans, floating- rate notes, and interest rate swaps. We have established interest rate risk limits that we closely monitor by measuring interest rate sensitivities in our debt and interest rate derivatives portfolios.\n\nOur foreign-denominated long-term debt has been swapped from fixed-rate or floating-rate foreign currencies to fixed-rate U.S. dollars at issuance through crosscurrency swaps, removing interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk associated with the underlying interest and principal payments. Likewise, periodically we enter into interest rate locks to partially hedge the risk of increases in the benchmark interest rate during the period leading up to the probable issuance of fix edrate debt. We expect gains or losses on our cross-currency swaps and interest rate locks to offset the losses and gains in the financial instruments they hedge.\n\nWe had no interest rate swaps and no interest rate locks at December 31, 2024.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk\n\nWe principally use foreign exchange contracts to hedge costs and debt denominated in foreign currencies. We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk through our foreign affiliates and equity investments in foreign companies.\n\nThrough cross-currency swaps, our foreign-denominated debt has been swapped from fixed-rate or floating-rate foreign currencies to fixed-rate U.S. dollars at issuance, removing interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk associated with the underlying interest and principal payments. We expect gains or losses in our cross-currency swaps to offset the gains and losses in the financial instruments they hedge. We had cross-currency swaps with a notional value of $34,884 and a fair value of $(4,076) outstanding at December 31, 2024.\n\nFor the purpose of assessing specific risks, we use a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk ex posures may have on the fair value of our financial instruments and results of operations. We had no foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2024.",

We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. We record derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value that is derived from observable market data, including yield curves and foreign exchange rates (all of our derivatives are Level 2). Cash flows associated with derivative instruments are presented in the same category on the consolidated statements of cash flows as the item being hedged.\n\nFair Value Hedging Periodically, we enter into and designate fix ed-to-floating interest rate swaps as fair value hedges. The purpose of these swaps is to manage interest rate risk by managing our mix of fix ed-rate and floating-rate debt. These swaps involve the receipt of fix ed-rate amounts for floating interest rate payments over the life of the swaps without exchange of the underlying principal amount.\n\nWe also designate most of our cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange contracts as fair value hedges. The purpose of these contracts is to hedge foreign currency risk associated with changes in spot rates on foreign-denominated debt. For cross-currency hedges, we have elected to exclude the change in fair value of the swap related to both time value and cross-currency basis spread from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. For foreign exchange contracts, we have elected to exclude the change in fair value of forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.\n\nUnrealized and realized gains or losses from fair value hedges impact the same category on the consolidated statements of income as the item being hedged, including the earnings impact of excluded components. In instances where we have elected to exclude components from the assessment of hedge effectiveness related to fair value hedges, unrealized gains or losses on such ex cluded components are recorded as a component of accumulated OCI and recognized into earnings over the life of the hedging instrument. Unrealized gains on derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded at fair value as assets, and unrealized losses are recorded at fair market value as liabilities. Ex cept for ex cluded components, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges are offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets or liabilities through earnings. In the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, no ineffectiveness was measured on fair value hedges.\n\nCash Flow Hedging We designate some of our cross-currency swaps as cash flow hedges to hedge our exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are attributable to foreign currency risk and interest rate risk generated from our foreign-denominated debt. These agreements include initial and final ex changes of principal from fix ed foreign denominated amounts to fixed U.S. dollar denominated amounts, to be exchanged at a specified rate that is usually determined by the market spot rate upon issuance. They also include an interest rate swap of a fixed or floating foreign denominated interest rate to a fix ed U.S. dollar denominated interest rate.\n\nOn September 30, 2022, we de-designated most of our cross-currency swaps from cash flow hedges and re-designated these swaps as fair value hedges. The amount remaining in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to cash flow hedges on the de-designation date was $1,857. The amount will be reclassified to earnings when the hedged item is recognized in earnings or when it becomes probable that the forecasted transactions will not occur. The election of fair value hedge designation for cross-currency swaps does not have an impact on our financial results.\n\nUnrealized gains on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value as assets, and unrealized losses are recorded at fair value as liabilities. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value are reported as a component of accumulated OCI and are reclassified into the consolidated statements of income in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings.\n\nPeriodically, we enter into and designate interest rate locks to partially hedge the risk of changes in interest payments attributable to increases in the benchmark interest rate during the period leading up to the probable issuance of fix ed-rate debt. We designate our interest rate locks as cash flow hedges. Gains and losses when we settle our interest rate locks are amortized into income over the life of the related debt. Over the nex t 12 months, we ex pect to reclassify $59 from accumulated OCI to 'Interest expense' due to the amortization of net losses on historical interest rate locks.\n\nCollateral and Credit-Risk Contingency We have entered into agreements with our derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. At December 31, 2024, we had posted collateral of $188 (a deposit asset) and held collateral of $0 (a receipt liability). Under the agreements, if AT&amp;T's credit rating had been downgraded two ratings levels by Fitch Ratings, one level by S&amp;P and one level by Moody's, before the final collateral exchange in December, we would have been required to post additional collateral of $52. If AT&amp;T's credit rating had been downgraded three ratings levels by Fitch Ratings, two levels by S&amp;P and two levels by Moody's, we would have been required to post additional collateral of $3,986. At December 31, 2023, we had posted collateral of $670 (a deposit asset) and held collateral of $5 (a receipt liability). We do not offset the fair value of collateral, whether the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) ex ists, against the fair value of the derivative instruments.",

Meta, on the other hand, recognizes advertising revenue based on the number of impressions delivered, with revenue recognized in the period impressions are displayed to users. Therefore, while both companies rely on impressions for advertising revenue, Disney's growth was specifically driven by platform expansion and content strategy, whereas Meta's model is more standardized and tied directly to impression delivery volume.",

      "question": "In 2023, how do content distribution challenges specifically impact the profitability of Disney's DTC offerings and Meta's advertising business, and what mechanisms are explicitly described in their respective 10-K filings that link these challenges to their financial performance?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Disney's DTC offerings are negatively impacted by declines in traditional content distribution models, which affect the cost of content allocable to its DTC services, thereby reducing profitability. This is explicitly stated in Disney's 10-K, which notes that declines in traditional forms of distribution have led to higher costs being allocated to DTC offerings. Meanwhile, Meta's advertising business is affected by changes in feed display and ranking algorithms that reduce time spent and user engagement, which in turn lowers advertising effectiveness and revenue. The 10-K explicitly states that these algorithmic changes have reduced, and may continue to reduce, the distribution of content by publishers and marketers, lowering their incentive to invest in Meta's platform. Both companies report that these content distribution challenges directly affect their financial performance: Disney through increased costs and reduced profitability in its DTC segment, and Meta through lower ad targeting capabilities and reduced engagement metrics.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from DIS_10k_2023.pdf - Disney's DTC profitability is negatively impacted due to higher content costs as declines in traditional distribution models (e.g., broadcast and cable) are shifting costs to DTC offerings.",
        "Step 2: Extract from META_10k_2023.pdf - Meta's algorithm changes reduce user engagement and content distribution for publishers, which affects ad targeting and monetization effectiveness, directly impacting advertising revenue.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies face content distribution challenges that directly affect their financial performance in 2023: Disney through cost allocation issues in DTC, and Meta through reduced engagement and ad performance."

      "answer": "Disney faces potential monetary fines from FCC violations related to its television broadcasting operations, which include the licensing of stations that must be renewed every up to eight years. Non-renewal or revocation of these licenses due to violations could result in significant financial penalties and operational disruptions. Meta, on the other hand, is subject to substantial monetary remedies from non-compliance with its FTC consent order and other global privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA. The FTC has already initiated proceedings seeking significant modifications to the consent order, including restrictions on data usage and potential board changes, which could lead to costly compliance adjustments and monetary penalties. While both companies face exposure to regulatory fines, Meta's liabilities appear broader and more complex due to the global nature of its regulatory obligations and the potential for sweeping operational changes.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Disney is subject to 'substantial monetary fines' from FCC violations, and its television stations must have licenses renewed every up to eight years, with no assurance of renewal.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Meta faces potential 'substantial monetary remedies' from FTC enforcement and global privacy laws, including the possibility of a modified consent order that could restrict product development and impose costly compliance changes.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies face regulatory risk exposure, but the nature and scope differ: Disney's risk is tied to FCC licensing of broadcast stations, while Meta's is broader, involving global privacy laws and active FTC enforcement actions."

      "answer": "Disney explicitly discloses $549 million in produced and licensed content costs on its balance sheet, providing clear visibility into its content investment spending. In contrast, while Meta acknowledges content costs as part of its cost of revenue and describes its payment arrangements with content providers, it does not disclose any specific dollar amounts for these costs. This difference in disclosure means investors can directly assess Disney's content spending through its financial statements, but must rely on qualitative descriptions alone for Meta's content costs, resulting in greater financial transparency from Disney compared to Meta regarding content investments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From Disney's 10-K, identify the specific line item for 'Produced and licensed content costs' at $549 million, showing explicit financial disclosure of content investment.",
        "Step 2: From Meta's 10-K, locate the 'Content Costs' section which explains their payment arrangements with content providers but contains no quantified figures for these costs.",
        "Step 3: Compare the two approaches - Disney provides quantified financial disclosure while Meta only provides qualitative description.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize the impact on financial statement transparency - explicit quantification enables better investor evaluation of Disney's content spending compared to Meta's less transparent approach."

      "answer": "Netflix has a known and quantified non-income tax exposure of approximately $400 million in Brazil, which is expected to increase over time. This liability is specifically tied to disputes with Brazilian tax authorities over the tax treatment and rates applied to its revenue. In contrast, while Meta discloses exposure to non-income tax liabilities and is involved in audits globally, it does not quantify its exposure in Brazil or any other specific jurisdiction. This reveals that Netflix\u2019s liability, while substantial, is more certain and explicitly defined, whereas Meta\u2019s non-income tax risks remain more general and less quantified, creating greater uncertainty around potential financial impacts.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Meta discloses exposure to non-income tax liabilities and audits globally but does not quantify specific amounts or jurisdictions.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Comparing both disclosures reveals that while both companies face non-income tax risks, Netflix\u2019s liability is more defined and certain, whereas Meta\u2019s exposure remains broad and undefined, making the financial impact more unpredictable."

The incurrence of indebtedness also results in increased fixed obligations and increased interest expense, and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. We may also issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions and we regularly grant restricted stock units to retain the employees of acquired companies, which could increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial results, and result in dilution to our stockholders. In addition, any acquisitions or other strategic transactions we announce could be viewed negatively by users, marketers, developers, or investors, which may adversely affect our business or the price of our Class A common stock.\n\nWe may also discover liabilities, deficiencies, or other claims associated with the companies or assets we acquire that were not identified in advance, which may result in significant unanticipated costs. The effectiveness of our due diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their representatives, as well as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed. In addition, we may fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition or other strategic transaction, including tax and accounting charges. Acquisitions or other strategic transactions may also result in our recording of significant additional expenses to our results of operations and recording of substantial finite-lived intangible assets on our balance sheet upon closing. Any of these factors may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\n\n## We may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions, and we incur significant costs to integrate and support the companies we acquire.\n\nThe integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources, particularly with respect to companies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience, and we may not manage these processes successfully. We have made, and may in the future make, substantial investments of resources to support our acquisitions, which can result in significant ongoing operating expenses and the diversion of resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We cannot assure you that these investments will be successful. If we fail to successfully integrate the companies we acquire, we may not realize the benefits ex pected from the transaction and our business may be harmed.\n\n## We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\n\nOur tax obligations, including income and non-income taxes, are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements, including the  manner  in  which  we  operate  our  business,  develop,  value,  manage,  protect,  and  use  our  intellectual  property,  and  the  valuations  of  our  intercompany transactions.  The  tax   laws  applicable  to  our  business,  including  the  laws  of  the  United  States  and  other  jurisdictions,  are  subject  to  interpretation  and  certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax  revenue from companies such as Meta. We are subject to regular review and audit by U.S. federal, state, and foreign tax  authorities. Tax  authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, including our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For example, in 2016 and 2018, the IRS issued formal assessments relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 through 2013 tax years. Although we disagree with the IRS's position and are litigating this issue, the ultimate resolution is uncertain and, if resolved in a manner unfavorable to us, may adversely affect our financial results.\n\nThe determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our provision for income taxes is determined by the manner in which we operate our business, and any changes to such operations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate. Although we believe that our provision for income taxes and estimates of our non-income tax liabilities are reasonable, the ultimate settlement may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.",

Obligations that are in non-U.S. dollar currencies are translated to the U.S. dollar at period end rates. An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements as well as other production related commitments. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time the Company enters into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV  series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of such license agreements. The Company does not include any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. However, the unknown obligations are expected to be significant.\n\n## Legal Proceedings\n\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to litigation matters and claims, including claims relating to employee relations, business practices and patent infringement. Litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and the Company's view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold. The Company expenses legal fees as incurred. The Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Company's operations or its financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\n\nThe Company is involved in litigation matters not listed herein but does not consider the matters to be material either individually or in the aggregate at this time. The Company's view of the matters not listed may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold.\n\n## Non-Income Taxes\n\nThe Company is routinely under audit by various tax authorities with regard to non-income tax matters. The subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to our revenue in certain jurisdictions. We accrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.\n\nSimilar to other U.S. companies doing business in Brazil, the Company is involved in a number of matters with Brazilian tax authorities regarding non-income tax assessments. Although the Company believes it has meritorious defenses to these matters, there is inherent complexity and uncertainty with respect to these matters, and the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations. The current potential exposure with respect to the various issues with Brazilian tax authorities regarding non-income tax assessments is estimated to be approximately $400 million, which is expected to increase over time.",

      "answer": "The combined total of Meta's and Netflix's 2024 purchases of property and equipment is $37.70 billion. Meta spent $37.26 billion on purchases of property and equipment, primarily to invest in servers, data centers, and network infrastructure, reflecting its focus on expanding AI and core business capabilities. Netflix spent $439.538 million on similar purchases, which is significantly lower and indicates a lesser emphasis on physical infrastructure.

The increase in cash flows from operating activities during 2024 compared to 2023, was due to an increase in cash collection from our customers driven by the increase in revenue, partially offset by higher cash paid for income taxes and other operational spending.\n\n## Cash Used in Investing Activities\n\nCash used in investing activities during 2024 mostly consisted of $37.26 billion of purchases of property and equipment as we continued to invest in servers, data centers, and network infrastructure, and $9.75 billion of net purchases of marketable securities.

      "question": "How does the increasing cost of sports programming rights impact both CMCSA's and DIS's competitive positioning in the media industry, given their respective content strategies?",
      "answer": "CMCSA faces increasing programming expenses, particularly for sports programming rights, which are a significant component of its content costs and could adversely affect its Cable Communications segment if not offset through rate increases or cost management. Meanwhile, DIS maintains an extensive portfolio of sports programming rights, including major U.S. leagues and international events, which it uses to produce content across both linear networks and DTC platforms. As CMCSA faces rising costs and potential non-renewal risks for such rights, DIS's ownership of exclusive sports content enhances its competitive advantage by enabling it to retain control over distribution and monetization, especially through its DTC services. This dynamic places CMCSA at a disadvantage in retaining subscribers and advertisers, while DIS strengthens its content moat in a competitive media landscape.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from CMCSA evidence - Programming expenses are the largest single expense for Cable Communications, with increasing costs for sports programming rights posing a risk if not offset by rate increases or cost initiatives.",
        "Step 2: Extract from DIS evidence - DIS holds extensive sports programming rights (e.g., NFL, NBA, MLB, English Premier League) and uses them across linear and DTC platforms, giving it control over monetization and distribution.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - CMCSA\u2019s rising costs for sports rights threaten its profitability and competitive position, while DIS leverages these rights to strengthen its own content strategy, creating a multi-hop causal relationship where DIS\u2019s strategic advantage grows as CMCSA\u2019s cost pressures increase."

We  derive  substantial  revenue  from  the  sale  of  advertising,  and  a  decline  in  expenditures  by  advertisers,  including  through traditional linear television distribution models, could negatively impact our results of operations. Declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries, increased competition for the leisure time of viewers, such as from social media  and  video  games,  audience  fragmentation,  increased  viewing  of  content  through  DTC  streaming  and  other  OTT  service providers,  regulatory  intervention  regarding  where  and  when  advertising  may  be  placed,  or  economic  conditions  generally.  In addition, advertisers have shifted a portion of their total expenditures to digital media, which can deliver targeted advertising. Their willingness to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings and reduced viewership, which many of NBCUniversal's networks and some of Sky's television channels have experienced and likely will continue to experience, or  from  the  level  of  popularity  or  perceived  acceptance  of  Peacock.  Advertising  sales  and  rates  also  are  dependent  on  the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels.\n\n## Programming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect Cable Communications' video businesses.\n\nWe  expect  programming  expenses  for  our  video  services  to  continue  to  be  the  largest  single  expense  item  for  our  Cable Communications  segment  and  to  continue  to  increase  on  a  per  subscriber  basis.  Part  of  Cable  Communications'  programming expenses  include  payments  to  certain  local  broadcast  television  stations  in  exchange  for  their  required  consent  for  the retransmission of broadcast network programming to video services customers; we expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations. These market factors may be exacerbated by increased consolidation in the media industry, which may further increase our programming expenses. If we are unable to raise our customers' rates or otherwise offset programming cost increases through the sale of additional services, cost management or other initiatives, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our Cable Communications segment's results of operations.\n\nMoreover, as our contracts with content providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms, or  at  all,  in  which  case  we  may  be  unable  to  provide  such  content  as  part  of  Cable  Communications'  video  services,  and  our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\n## NBCUniversal's and Sky's success depends on consumer acceptance of their content, and their businesses may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase.\n\nNBCUniversal  and  Sky  create  and  acquire  media  and  entertainment  content,  the  success  of  which  depends  substantially  on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways. The success of these businesses depends on our ability to consistently create, acquire, market and distribute television programming, filmed entertainment, theme park attractions and other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer markets. We have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial amounts in our content, including in the production of original content for NBCUniversal, including Peacock, and Sky, in our films and for new theme parks and theme park attractions, before learning the extent to which they will earn consumer acceptance. In addition, there can be no assurance that Peacock will continue to grow or sustain its revenue or user base or successfully compete as a standalone DTC streaming service.\n\nNBCUniversal  and  Sky  also  obtain  a  significant  portion  of  their  content  from  third  parties,  such  as  movie  studios,  television production companies, sports organizations and other suppliers, sometimes on an exclusive basis. Competition for popular content, particularly for sports programming, is intense, and at times, we may increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors  for  popular  content.  We  also  may  be  unable  to  license  popular  third-party  content  for  NBCUniversal's  and  Sky's television  programming  channels  if  media  companies  determine  that  licensing  the  content  to  us  is  not  in  their  strategic  best interests. For example, content creators have launched and may continue to launch their own DTC streaming or other OTT services, forgoing license fees from us to provide their content directly to consumers, or they may license their content to our competitors on an exclusive basis.\n\nEntering into or renewing contracts for such programming rights or acquiring additional rights has in the past and in the future may result  in  significantly  increased  costs.  Particularly  with  respect  to  long-term  contracts  for  sports  programming  rights  for NBCUniversal and Sky, our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors,",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nIn fiscal 2023, the Studios plan to produce approximately 40 titles, which include films and episodic television programs, for distribution theatrically and/or on our DTC platforms.\n\n## General Entertainment\n\nContent produced by General Entertainment primarily consists of original episodic television programs, network news and daytime/nighttime content. General Entertainment also acquires episodic television programming rights. Original content is generally produced by the following Company owned television studios: ABC Signature; 20th Television; Disney Branded Television; FX Productions; and National Geographic Studios. Original content is also commissioned by General Entertainment and produced by various other third-party studios. Costs to produce original content are generally capitalized and allocated to the distribution platform utilizing the content. Program development is carried out in collaboration with writers, producers and creative teams.\n\nGeneral Entertainments television programming library includes content from approximately 70 years of production history. Series with four or more seasons include approximately 75 one-hour dramas, 55 half-hour comedies, 5 half-hour non-scripted series, 30 one-hour non-scripted series, 15 half-hour animated series and 10 half-hour live-action series. The library includes approximately 130 series that the General Entertainment group produced for initial distribution on our DTC platforms.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, General Entertainment plans to produce or commission more than 270 original programs, most of which will include multiple episodes. Productions generally include comedies, dramas, animations, documentaries, specials, made for TV movies, shorts and network news content. The vast majority of programming will be used on our Linear Networks and/or our DTC platforms. Programming is also produced for third-parties, many of which have domestic linear distribution rights, while the Company has SVOD and international distribution rights.\n\n## Sports\n\nThe Company has various professional and college sports programming rights, which the Sports group uses to produce content aired on our Linear Networks and distributed on our DTC platforms, including live events, sports news and original content. In the U.S., rights include college football (including bowl games and the College Football Playoff) and basketball, the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Football League (NFL), MLB, US Open Tennis, the Professional Golfers' Association (PGA) Championship, the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), soccer, Top Rank Boxing, the Wimbledon Championships, the Masters golf tournament, mixed martial arts and the National Hockey League (NHL). Internationally, rights include various cricket events (for which the Company has the global distribution rights to certain events) and soccer (including English Premier League, LaLiga, Bundesliga and multiple UEFA leagues).\n\n## International\n\nThe International group focuses on the development and production of locally created and relevant entertainment and sports content to support growth across the Company's portfolio of streaming services. In addition, this group also oversees international media operations, including international linear channels, local advertising sales and local content sales and distribution. International has produced approximately 150 movies and series for initial distribution on the DTC platforms worldwide.\n\n## Competition and Seasonality\n\nThe Company's Linear Networks and DTC streaming services compete for viewers primarily with other television networks, independent television stations and other media, such as other DTC streaming services and video games. With respect to the sale of advertising time, we compete with other television networks, independent television stations, MVPDs and other advertising media such as digital content, newspapers, magazines, radio and billboards. Our television and radio stations primarily compete for audiences and advertisers in local market areas.\n\nThe Company's Linear Networks compete with other networks for carriage by MVPDs. The Company's contractual agreements with MVPDs are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Consolidation and other market conditions in the cable, satellite and telecommunication distribution industry and other factors may adversely affect the Company's ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of its various programming services that are as favorable as those currently in place.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing businesses compete with all forms of entertainment. A significant number of companies produce and/or distribute theatrical and television content, distribute products in the home entertainment market, provide pay television and SVOD services, and produce music and live theater.\n\nThe operating results of Content Sales/Licensing fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods.\n\nThe Company's websites and digital products compete with other websites and entertainment products.",

      "question": "How does the allocation of scheduled advertising time by CMCSA relate to the factors influencing advertising revenue for Disney's Linear Networks, given their respective roles in the advertising ecosystem?",
      "answer": "CMCSA receives an allocation of scheduled advertising time that it sells to local, regional, and national advertisers as part of its distribution agreements with cable networks. This positions CMCSA as a distributor of advertising inventory on behalf of content providers. In contrast, Disney\u2019s Linear Networks generate advertising revenue based on the size and nature of the audience delivered by its domestic channels (e.g., Disney Channel, ESPN, ABC), with advertising rates dependent on audience metrics and advertiser demand. Therefore, while CMCSA monetizes allocated advertising time as a distribution partner, Disney\u2019s revenue from advertising is directly tied to the popularity and reach of its content. The connection lies in CMCSA serving as a sales channel for advertising inventory, while Disney provides the content that drives audience engagement and, consequently, advertising demand.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - CMCSA receives an allocation of scheduled advertising time and sells it as part of distribution agreements with cable networks.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Disney's Linear Networks derive advertising revenue based on the size and nature of the audience delivered, and advertising rates depend on audience metrics and demand.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - CMCSA acts as a sales agent for advertising inventory allocated by networks, including Disney, while Disney\u2019s revenue is driven by the content quality and audience size that determines ad demand. The relationship hinges on CMCSA distributing advertising time that is monetized based on Disney\u2019s content-driven audience metrics."

We also offer Ethernet network services, which  connect  multiple  locations  and  provide  higher  downstream  and  upstream  speed  options  to  medium-sized  customers  and larger enterprises, and advanced voice services, as well as video solutions for hotels and other large venues. In addition, we provide cellular backhaul services to mobile network operators to help manage their network bandwidth.\n\nOur business services offerings for medium-sized and enterprise customers also include a software-defined networking product, and larger enterprises may also receive support services related to Wi-Fi networks, router management, network security, business continuity risks and other services. These services are primarily provided to Fortune 1000 companies and other large enterprises with  multiple  locations  both  within  and  outside  of  our  cable  distribution  footprint,  where  we  provide  coverage  outside  of  our service areas through agreements with other companies to use their networks.\n\n## Advertising\n\nWe generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time that our advertising business sells to local, regional and national advertisers as part of our distribution agreements with cable networks, and we also generate revenue from selling advertising on our digital  platforms.  Our  advertising  business  also  represents  the  advertising  sales  efforts  of  other  multichannel  video  providers  in some markets and offers additional technology, tools, data-driven services and marketplace solutions to customers in the media industry to facilitate advertisers more effectively engaging with their target audiences.\n\n## Other\n\nOur security and automation services provide home monitoring services and the ability to manage other functions within the home, such as lighting and room temperature, through our online portal, mobile apps and the X1 platform. We also license our technology platforms to other multichannel video providers.\n\n## Network and Technology\n\nOur  Cable  Communications  cable  distribution  system  uses  a  hybrid  fiber-optic  and  coaxial  cable  network  that  we  believe  is sufficiently flexible and scalable to support our future technology requirements and enables us to continue to grow capacity and capabilities  over  time.  This  network  provides  the  two-way  transmissions  that  are  essential  to  providing  broadband  services, interactive  video  services  such  as  integrated  search  functionality,  On  Demand  and  DVR,  voice  services,  and  security  and automation  services.  Leveraging  DOCSIS  3.1  technology,  Cable  Communications  currently  deploys  broadband  services  with downstream speeds for residential customers up to over a gigabit per second across nearly our entire footprint. We continue to evolve and enhance our network and plan to leverage DOCSIS 4.0 technology to begin deploying multigigabit symmetrical speeds in the future. Additionally, Cable Communications has been automating many core network functions in order to expand capacity and increase operating efficiency and to identify and fix network issues before they affect our customers.\n\nCable  Communications  continues  to  focus  on  technology  initiatives  to  design,  develop  and  deploy  next-generation  media  and content  delivery  platforms,  such  as  the  X1  and  Flex  platforms  and  cloud  DVR  technology  that  use  Internet  Protocol  ('IP') technology and our own cloud network servers to deliver video and advanced search capability. These platforms are based on our global technology platform, which integrates linear television networks, certain owned and third-party DTC streaming services and other  internet-based  apps,  and  on  demand  content  in  one  unified  experience  with  voice-activated  remote  control  search  and interactive  features.  Cable  Communications  also  pursues  technology  initiatives  related  to  broadband  services  that  leverage  our global technology platform, providing customers with in-and-out-of-home Wi-Fi, the ability to manage their Wi-Fi network and connected home with our xFi whole-home application and online portal, advanced security technology and other features.\n\n## Sources of Supply and Other Operations\n\nTo offer video services, Cable Communications licenses substantial amounts of programming from cable and broadcast networks, as  well  as  from  local  broadcast  television  stations.  The  fees  associated  with  these  programming  distribution  agreements  are generally based on the number of subscribers who are able to watch the programming and the platforms on which the content is provided. We seek to include in distribution agreements the rights to offer such programming through multiple delivery platforms, such as through our On Demand service, online portal, mobile apps and Flex.\n\nFor  wireless  services,  we  have  an  MVNO  agreement  that  allows  us  to  offer  services  using  Verizon's  wireless  network  and  we purchase from a limited number of suppliers a significant number of wireless handsets, tablets and smart watches that we sell to wireless customers.\n\nCable  Communications  purchases  from  a  limited  number  of  suppliers  a  significant  amount  of  customer  premise  equipment, including  wireless  gateways  and  set-top  boxes,  network  equipment  and  services  to  provide  services  to  residential  and  business customers.\n\nCable Communications uses two primary vendors to provide customer billing for our residential and business customers.\n\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

Internal content is generally produced by the following television studios: ABC Signature; 20th Television; Disney Television Animation; FX Productions; and various studios for which we commission productions for our branded channels and DTC streaming services\n- Sports - Primarily acquisition of professional and college sports programming rights and related production costs\n- International - Primarily internal production of and acquisition of rights to local content outside the U.S. and Canada\n- Selling, general and administrative costs, including marketing costs\n- Depreciation and amortization\n\n## Media and Entertainment Distribution Strategy\n\nThe Company has significantly increased its focus on distribution of content via our own DTC streaming services relative to traditional distribution of content. In general, film content was traditionally distributed first in the theatrical market, followed by the home entertainment market and then in the TV/SVOD market. In general, episodic television content was traditionally launched on our domestic linear networks and licensed for use globally in other TV/SVOD windows. Although the Company continues to monetize a significant amount of its content in the traditional manner, our focus on our own DTC distribution has had a number of impacts including but not limited to:\n\n- in some cases, we are producing exclusive content for our DTC streaming services;\n- rather than selling our content in the TV/SVOD market, we generally distribute it on our DTC streaming services; and\n- in part because of the impact of COVID-19 on theatrical markets around the world, we may alter our traditional theatrical distribution approach, for example by making a film available on our DTC streaming services at the same time it is in theaters or shortly thereafter (e.g. Premier Access).\n\nOver time, all else being equal, these impacts will tend to increase revenue and costs at Direct-to-Consumer and reduce revenue and costs at Content Sales/Licensing and Linear Networks. Our distribution approach is based on flexibility in our windowing strategy, and we may change our original launch and distribution strategy for any particular piece of content. Distribution decisions may impact revenues and viewership, and the allocation of costs to our businesses/distribution platforms, particularly programming, production and marketing costs, depends on the distribution approach.\n\nA more detailed discussion of our distribution businesses and production groups follows.\n\n## Linear Networks\n\nThe majority of Linear Networks revenue is derived from affiliate fees and advertising sales. The Company's linear networks businesses provide programming under multi-year licensing agreements with MVPDs and/or affiliated television stations that are generally based on contractually specified rates on a per subscriber basis. The amounts that we can charge to MVPDs for our networks is largely dependent on the quality and quantity of programming that we can provide and the competitive market for programming services. The ability to sell advertising time and the rates received are primarily dependent on the size and nature of the audience that the network can deliver to the advertiser as well as overall advertiser demand.\n\nLinear Networks consist of our domestic and international branded television channels.\n\n## Domestic Channels\n\nOur domestic channels include Cable operations comprising Disney, ESPN, Freeform, FX and National Geographic branded channels and Broadcasting operations comprising ABC and eight owned ABC affiliated television stations.\n\n## Cable\n\n## Disney Channels\n\nBranded television channels include: Disney Channel; Disney Junior; and Disney XD (collectively Disney Channels).\n\nDisney Channel - the Disney Channel airs original series and movie programming 24 hours a day targeted to kids ages 2 to 14. The channel features live-action comedy series, animated programming and preschool series as well as original movies and theatrical films.\n\nDisney Junior - the Disney Junior channel airs programming 24 hours a day targeted to kids ages 2 to 7 and their parents and caregivers. The channel features animated and live-action programming that blends Disney's storytelling and characters with learning. Disney Junior also airs as a programming block on the Disney Channel.\n\nDisney XD - the Disney XD channel airs programming 24 hours a day targeted to kids ages 6 to 11. The channel features a mix of live-action and animated programming.",

      "answer": "CMCSA's Programming and Production Costs for the Sky Segment in 2021 decreased when excluding foreign currency effects, primarily due to lower costs for Serie A and entertainment programming, partially offset by increased costs from more sporting events due to the delayed 2020-21 European football seasons. In contrast, DIS's Domestic Channels Programming and Production Costs increased slightly from $12,120 million in 2021 to $12,188 million in 2022, reflecting a 1% increase. Therefore, while DIS experienced a marginal rise in costs, CMCSA saw a net decrease in real terms, driven by specific content cost dynamics.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From CMCSA's 2022 10-K, extract that Programming and Production Costs decreased in 2021 (excluding foreign currency) due to lower Serie A and entertainment programming costs, offset by more sporting events due to the delayed football season.",

Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue increased primarily reflecting an overall market recovery compared to the prior year period.\n\n## Sky Segment - Operating Costs and Expenses\n\n## Programming and Production Costs\n\nExpenses  primarily  relate  to  content  broadcast  on  our  channels.  These  costs  include  the  amortization  of  owned  and  licensed programming, including sports rights, direct production costs, production overhead and on-air talent costs. These expenses also include the fees associated with programming distribution agreements for channels owned by third parties.\n\nExpenses increased in 2021 compared to 2020. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, expenses decreased primarily due to lower costs associated with Serie A and entertainment programming in the current year period, partially offset by an increase in the number of sporting events in the current year period due to COVID-19, which delayed the starts of the 2020-21 European football seasons.\n\n## Direct Network Costs\n\nExpenses primarily include costs directly related to the supply of broadband and voice services, including wireless services for wireless handsets and tablets, to our customers. This includes call costs, monthly wholesale access fees and other variable costs associated with our network. In addition, it includes the cost of wireless handsets sold to customers.\n\nExpenses increased in 2021 compared to 2020. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, expenses increased primarily due to an increase  in  costs  associated  with  Sky's  wireless  phone  and  broadband  services  as  a  result  of  increases  in  the  sale  of  wireless handsets and the number of customers receiving these services.\n\n## Other Expenses\n\nExpenses include costs related to marketing, fees paid to third-party channels for which Sky represents the advertising sales efforts, subscriber management, supply chain, transmission, technology, fixed networks and general administrative costs.\n\nExpenses increased  in  2021  compared  to  2020.

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n- Group - lifetime value is predominantly derived from third-party revenues that are attributable only to a bundle of titles (e.g. subscription revenue for a DTC service or affiliate fees for a cable television network)\n\nThe determination of the predominant monetization strategy is made at commencement of production on a consolidated basis and is based on the means by which we derive third-party revenues from use of the content. Imputed title by title license fees that may be necessary for other purposes are established as required for those purposes.\n\nWe generally classify content that is initially intended for use on our DTC streaming services or Linear Networks as group assets. We generally classify content initially intended for theatrical release or for sale to third-party licensees as individual assets. The predominant monetization strategy for content released prior to the beginning of fiscal 2020 (the date the Company adopted accounting guidance that was applied prospectively) was determined based on the expected means of monetization over the remaining life of the content. Thus for example, film titles that were released theatrically and in home entertainment prior to fiscal year 2020 and are now distributed on Disney+ are generally considered group content.\n\nThe classification of content as individual or group only changes if there is a significant change to the title's monetization strategy relative to its initial assessment (e.g. content that was initially intended for license to a third party is instead used on an owned DTC service). When there is a significant change in monetization strategy, the title's capitalized content costs are tested for impairment.\n\nProduction costs for content that is predominantly monetized individually are amortized based upon the ratio of the current period's revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues). For film productions, Ultimate Revenues include revenues from all sources, which may include imputed license fees for content that is used on our DTC streaming services, that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial release for theatrical films. For episodic television series that are classified as individual, Ultimate Revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years, including imputed license fees for content that is used on our DTC streaming services, from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later. Participations and residuals are expensed over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period's revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues for each production.\n\nProduction costs that are predominantly monetized as a group are amortized based on projected usage, generally resulting in an accelerated or straight-line amortization pattern. Adjustments to projected usage are applied prospectively in the period of the change. Participations and residuals are generally expensed in line with the pattern of usage.\n\nLicensed rights to film and television content and other programs for broadcast on our Linear Networks or DTC streaming services are expensed on an accelerated or straight-line basis over their useful life or over the number of times the program is expected to be aired, as appropriate. We amortize rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement. If annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season's estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season.\n\nAcquired film and television libraries are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years from the date of acquisition. Acquired film and television libraries include content that was initially released three years prior to its acquisition, except it excludes the prior seasons of episodic television programming still in production at the date of its acquisition.\n\nAmortization of capitalized costs for produced and acquired content begins in the month the content is first released, while amortization of capitalized costs for licensed content commences when the license period begins and the content is first aired or available for use on our DTC services. Amortization of content assets is primarily included in 'Cost of services' in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nThe costs of produced and licensed film and television content are subject to regular recoverability assessments. For content that is predominantly monetized individually, the unamortized costs are compared to the estimated fair value. The fair value is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis of the cash flows directly attributable to the title. To the extent the unamortized costs exceed the fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. For content that is predominantly monetized as a group, the aggregate unamortized costs of the group are compared to the present value of the discounted cash flows using the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent of other produced and licensed content. If the unamortized costs exceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess and allocated to individual titles based on the relative carrying value of each title in the group. If there are no plans to continue to use an individual film or television program that is part of a group, the unamortized cost of the individual title is written-off immediately. Licensed content is included as part of the group within which it is monetized for purposes of assessing recoverability.",

The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as the Company typically expects more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability. The Company reviews factors impacting the amortization of the content assets on an ongoing basis. The Company's estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\n\nThe Company's business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed in aggregate at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, the Company has not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nThe Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. In addition, uncertain tax positions, tax-related valuation allowances and pre-acquisition contingencies are initially recorded in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.\n\n## Property and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally up to 30 years, or the expected lease term for leasehold improvements, if applicable.\n\n## Trade Receivables\n\nTrade receivables consist primarily of amounts related to members and payment partners that collect membership fees on the Company's behalf. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance for credit losses based on historical collection trends, the financial condition of its payment partners, and external market factors. The Company's allowance for credit losses was not material as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\n\n## Marketing\n\nMarketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to the Company's partners, including consumer electronics (\"CE\") manufacturers, multichannel video programming distributors (\"MVPDs\"), mobile operators and internet service providers (\"ISPs\"). Advertising expenses include promotional activities such as digital and television advertising. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $1,669 million, $1,447 million and $1,879 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Marketing expenses also include payroll and related expenses for personnel that support the Company's marketing activities.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nThe Company records a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.",

The increase was driven by lower film and television production spending and the timing of payments for sports rights. The increase also reflected collateral receipts related to our hedging program in the current year compared to collateral payments in the prior year, higher operating cash flows at Entertainment and the comparison to a payment in the prior year related to the termination of content licenses in fiscal 2022. The increase in operating cash flows at Entertainment was driven by lower cash disbursements due to a decrease in operating expenses. These increases were partially offset by higher cash tax payments in the current year compared to the prior year. Fiscal 2023 U.S. federal and California state tax  payments were deferred and paid in fiscal 2024 pursuant to relief provided by the Internal Revenue Service and California State Board of Equalization as a result of 2023 winter storms in California. In addition, a portion of fiscal 2024 U.S. federal and Florida state tax es was paid in fiscal 2024 and the remainder has been deferred to fiscal 2025 pursuant to relief provided by the Internal Revenue Service and Florida Department of Revenue as a result of 2024 hurricanes in Florida.\n\nDepreciation expense is as follows:\n\n",

During 2023, we received return of collateral posted of $880 million related to derivative contracts, net of payments. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Cash Flows Used In Financing Activities\n\nWe seek to maintain a mix of fixed and variable rate debt to lower borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters and to protect against earnings and cash flow volatility  resulting from changes in market conditions. During 2024 and 2023, net cash used in financing activities was $17.1 billion and $14.7 billion, respectively.\n\n## 2024\n\nDuring 2024, our net cash used in financing activities of $17.1 billion was primarily driven by $20.3 billion used for repayments and repurchases of long-term borrowings (secured and unsecured) as well as finance lease obligations, $11.2 billion used for dividend payments, and $1.1 billion used for other financing activities. These cash flows used in financing activities were partially offset by $15.6 billion provided by proceeds from long-term borrowings, which included $12.4 billion of proceeds from our asset-backed debt transactions.\n\n## Proceeds from and Repayments and Repurchases of Long-Term Borrowings\n\nAt December 31, 2024, our total debt decreased to $144.0 billion compared to $150.7 billion at December 31, 2023. Our effective interest rate was 5.1% and 4.9% during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively . We have entered into interest rate swaps to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt, managing our exposure to changes in interest rates. See \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures A bout M arket Risk\" and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, approximately $30.5 billion, or 20.6%, of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfolio consisted of foreign denominated debt, primarily Euro and British Pound Sterling. We have entered into cross currency swaps on our foreign denominated debt in order to fix our future interest and principal payments in U.S. dollars and mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. See \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures A bout Market Risk\" for additional information.\n\nVerizon may acquire debt securities issued by V erizon and its affiliates through open market purchases, redemptions, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers, exchange offers, or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as V erizon may from time to time determine, for cash or other consideration.\n\n## Other, Net\n\nOther, net cash flow from financing activities during 2024 includes $830 million in proceeds related to financing obligations for the cell towers transaction with Vertical Bridge. These proceeds were partially offset by $431 million in payments related to vendor financing arrangements, $425 million in equity distribution payments made for controlled entities, $313 million in payments made under the sublease arrangement for our cell towers, $280 million in cash consideration payments to acquire additional interest in certain controlled entities and $243 million in payments for settlement of cross currency swaps. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the V ertical Bridge transaction. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on noncontrolling interests.\n\n## Dividends\n\nThe Board of Directors of the Company assesses the level of our dividend payments on a periodic basis taking into account such factors as long-term growth opportunities, internal cash requirements and the expectations of our shareholders. During the third quarter of 2024, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend payment by 1.9% to $0.6775 from $0.6650 per share in the preceding quarter. This is the eighteenth consecutive year that Company's Board of Directors has approved a quarterly dividend increase.\n\nAs in prior periods, dividend payments were a significant use of capital resources. During 2024, we paid $11.2 billion in dividends.\n\n## 2023\n\nDuring 2023, our net cash used in financing activities of $14.7 billion was primarily driven by $11.0 billion used for dividend payments, $10.6 billion used for repayments and repurchases of long-term borrowings (secured and unsecured) as well as finance lease obligations and $1.5 billion used for other financing activities.

      "answer": "The difference in the 2024 healthcare cost trend rate assumption between DIS and VZ impacts their respective financial obligations related to postretirement medical plans by influencing the estimated future benefit payments and liabilities. VZ assumes a 2024 healthcare cost trend rate of 8.80%, which is significantly higher than the 4.50% rate to which it will gradually decline after 2034. This high initial assumption increases VZ\u2019s projected healthcare costs and long-term liabilities. Meanwhile, DIS acknowledges that assumptions like the healthcare cost trend rate significantly affect reported net periodic benefit costs and benefit obligations, though it does not specify its own rate. However, DIS also estimates $36 million in expected Medicare subsidy receipts, which directly reduces its net future benefit payments. Therefore, while both companies are impacted by healthcare cost trend assumptions, VZ\u2019s higher assumed rate increases its financial burden, whereas DIS benefits from subsidies that offset some of its obligations.",

        "Step 1: From DIS_10k_2024.pdf, identify that DIS estimates $36 million in expected Medicare subsidy receipts that reduce future benefit payments and that assumptions like the healthcare cost trend rate significantly affect benefit obligations.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize how the healthcare cost trend rate assumption influences both companies\u2019 financial obligations \u2014 VZ faces higher near-term liabilities due to the 8.80% assumption, while DIS benefits from a $36 million offset from Medicare subsidies despite similar sensitivity to trend rates."

(1)\n\n## Assumptions\n\nAssumptions, such as discount rates, long-term rate of return on plan assets and the healthcare cost trend rate, have a significant effect on the amounts reported for net periodic benefit cost as well as the related benefit obligations.\n\nDiscount Rate - The assumed discount rate for pension and postretirement medical plans reflects the market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available. The Company's discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of the plans' liability cash flows to the yield curves. The Company measures service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans' liability cash flows.\n\nLong-term rate of return on plan assets - The long-term rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of long-term returns on an investment portfolio consisting of a mixture of equities, fix ed income and alternative investments. When determining the long-term rate of return on plan assets, the Company considers long-term rates of return on the asset classes (both historical and forecasted) in which the Company expects the pension funds to be invested. The following longterm rates of return by asset class were considered in setting the long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption:\n\n",

Additionally, Google emphasizes the risks associated with the development and use of AI, including reputational harm, legal liability, and brand damage due to issues such as harmful content, inaccuracies, and data privacy concerns. These risks could deter users from using Google's products and services, directly impacting user retention. Meta similarly identifies user retention risks, including decreases in user sentiment due to concerns about data practices, privacy, and content quality, which could lead to reduced engagement. Meta also notes that initiatives involving evolving technologies like generative AI might be unsuccessful or discontinued, further affecting user retention.

      "question": "Considering the different hedging strategies described by Netflix and Google, how do the impacts of their respective hedging gains of $124 million and $211 million in 2024 compare relative to their international revenue exposures, and what does this suggest about their foreign exchange risk management approaches?",
      "answer": "In 2024, Netflix reported hedging gains of $124 million, which were included in 'Streaming revenues' and primarily related to foreign exchange hedges on forecasted revenue transactions and content licensing/production costs denominated in non-U.S. currencies. Google reported hedging gains of $211 million as part of its total revenues of $350,018 million, reflecting gains from its foreign exchange risk management activities. Netflix's hedging directly impacts both revenue and cost of revenues depending on the nature of the hedged item, while Google's hedging gains appear as a separate line item before being incorporated into total revenues. Given that Netflix's international revenue (excluding the U.S. and Canada) accounted for the majority of its streaming revenue, the $124 million gain suggests a more targeted approach to managing revenue volatility from foreign exchange movements. Google's larger hedging gains relative to Netflix, despite having a much larger revenue base, may indicate a more extensive or aggressive hedging program to manage its global exposure across multiple business lines.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From NFLX_10k_2024.pdf, identify that Netflix's hedging gains of $124 million are specifically included in 'Streaming revenues' and relate to foreign exchange hedges on forecasted revenue transactions and content licensing/production costs.",
        "Step 2: From GOOGL_10k_2024.pdf, extract Google's hedging gains of $211 million for 2024, which are listed as a separate line item before being incorporated into total revenues.",
        "Step 3: Compare the relative size of these hedging gains ($124M vs. $211M) in the context of each company's overall revenue base ($350,018M for Google; ~$3.8B international streaming revenue for Netflix).",
        "Step 4: Analyze how each company's approach to recognizing hedging gains reflects their foreign exchange risk management strategy - Netflix integrating hedging directly into revenue and cost of revenues, while Google reports it as a separate gain item."

These forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of foreign currency firm commitments and forecasted transactions and generally have maturities of 36 months or less. The hedging contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange movements, and the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures.\n\nThe gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency revenue is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ('AOCI') and reclassified into 'Revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of firmly committed or forecasted transactions related to the licensing and production of content assets is initially reported as a component of AOCI and reclassified into 'Cost of Revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings, which occurs as the underlying hedged content assets are amortized. Cash flows from hedging activities are classified in the same category as the cash flows for the underlying item being hedged within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nIn the event that the likelihood of occurrence of the underlying forecasted transactions is determined to be probable not to occur, the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges are reclassified from AOCI to 'Interest and other income (expense)' in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period of dedesignation.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nThe Company designates forward contracts as fair value hedges to manage the foreign exchange risk on its foreign-currency denominated debt. These hedges may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency ex change movements, and the Company may choose not to hedge the full amount of its exposure. The gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness is recognized in 'Interest and other income (expense),' net with the offsetting foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses on the hedged items. The Company excludes forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes the initial value of the excluded component over the life of the hedging instrument in 'Interest and other income (expense)' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The difference between changes in fair value of the excluded component and the amount recognized in earnings is recognized as a component in AOCI. Cash flows from hedging activities are classified in the same category as the cash flows for the underlying item being hedged within \"Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\n## Net investment hedges\n\nThe Company designates a portion of its foreign currency-denominated debt as net investment hedges to manage the foreign exchange risk on its investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. These hedges may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange movements, and the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures. The gains or losses on these non-derivative instruments are reported as a component of AOCI as part of the cumulative translation adjustment on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The accumulated gains and losses remain in AOCI until the hedged net investment is sold or liquidated, at which point the amounts recognized in AOCI are reclassified into earnings.\n\n## Derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments\n\nThe Company enters into forward contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk on intercompany transactions and monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currencies of the Company and its subsidiaries. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments and may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency ex change movements. The gains or losses on derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in 'Interest and other income (expense)' in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Cash flows related to these derivative instruments are classified within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nSee Note 7 Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Company's derivative and non-derivative financial instruments.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company grants non-qualified stock options to its employees on a monthly basis. For certain executive officers, the Company grants restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and performance-based restricted stock units (\"PSUs\"). Stock-based compensation expense is based on the fair value of the stock awards at the grant date and is recognized, net of forfeitures, over the requisite service period.

This increase alone was larger than AT&T's total Other Cost of Revenues for 2021, which stood at $31.232 billion.

See Note 1 of the Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included  in  Item  8  of  this Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  for  further information.\n- Our acquisition of Fitbit closed in early January 2021, and the related revenues are included in Google other.

See  Note  11  of  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included  in  Item  8  of  this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\n## The Effect of COVID-19 on our Financial Results\n\nWe began to observe the effect of COVID-19 on our financial results in March 2020 when, despite an increase in users' search activity, our advertising revenues declined compared to the prior year. This was due to a shift of user search activity  to  less  commercial  topics  and  reduced  spending  by  our  advertisers.  For  the  quarter  ended  June  30,  2020  our advertising revenues declined due to the continued effects of COVID-19 and the related reductions in global economic activity,  but  we  observed  a  gradual  return  in  user  search  activity  to  more  commercial  topics.  This  was  followed  by increased spending by our advertisers, which continued throughout the second half of 2020. Additionally, over the course of 2020, we experienced variability in our margins as many of our expenses are less variable in nature and/or may not correlate to changes in revenues. Market volatility contributed to fluctuations in the valuation of our equity investments. Further, our assessment of the credit deterioration of our customers due to changes in the macroeconomic environment during the period was reflected in our allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable.\n\nThroughout  2021  we  remained  focused  on  innovating  and  investing  in  the  services  we  offer  to  consumers  and businesses to support our long-term growth. The impact of COVID-19 on 2020 financial results affected year-over-year growth  trends.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  continues  to  evolve,  be  unpredictable  and  affect  our  business  and  financial results. Our past results may not be indicative of our future performance, and historical trends in our financial results may differ materially.\n\n## Financial Results\n\n## Revenues\n\nThe following table presents revenues by type (in millions):\n\n",

The increase in 2021 was due to higher TV production and licensing, which represent a partial recovery from prior-year impacts of the pandemic, as well as higher theatrical, with 2020 including only five worldwide theatrical releases compared to 17 in 2021. The decrease in 2020 was primarily due to pandemicrelated movie theater closures and television and theatrical production delays.\n\nAdvertising revenues increased in 2021 and decreased in 2020. The increase in 2021 was due to the return in 2021 of major sporting events, including the NCAA Division I Men's Championship Basketball Tournament. The decrease in 2020 was primarily due to the pandemic-related cancellation of sporting events, partially offset by higher news coverage of general elections and COVID-19 developments.\n\nDirect costs increased in 2021 and decreased in 2020. The increase in 2021 was driven by higher film and programming costs and increased costs for HBO Max. Direct costs supporting DTC revenues were $7,934 in 2021, versus $5,452 and $3,824 in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in 2020 was primarily due to pandemic-related closures and production delays.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2021 and decreased in 2020. The increase in 2021 was primarily due to incremental selling costs associated with a DIRECTV advertising revenue sharing arrangement, partially offset by lower bad debt expense and integration of support functions. The decrease in 2020 was primarily due to lower print and advertising expenses from limited theatrical releases, lower distribution fees and cost-saving initiatives, partially offset by marketing costs associated with HBO Max.\n\nOperating contribution decreased in 2021 and 2020. The WarnerMedia segment operating income margin was 20.3% in 2021, 26.9% in 2020 and 29.8% in 2019.\n\n## LATIN AMERICA SEGMENT\n\n",

Its content licensing revenue decreased by 2.0% (from $8,231 million in 2023 to $8,063 million in 2024).

      "answer": "Disney's Entertainment segment incurs programming and production costs that include amortization of capitalized production costs, licensed programming rights, subscriber-based fees for Hulu Live programming, live news production costs, participations and residuals, and intercompany fees for sports programming on ABC and Disney+. In contrast, the Sports segment's programming and production costs primarily involve amortization of licensed sports rights and production costs for live sports programming. These costs are central to both segments but reflect different content focuses\u2014general entertainment versus live sports. Meanwhile, Comcast's 2024 10-K shows that it also reports a dedicated 'Programming and Production Costs' line item in its financial disclosures (Note 4), indicating that both companies treat these costs as a significant, segmented component of their operations. However, while Disney breaks down its costs by intercompany licensing and streaming platform fees, Comcast does not provide the same level of granular detail in the provided excerpt, suggesting a potentially different approach to internal cost allocation or reporting transparency.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From DIS_10k_2024, identify the composition of programming and production costs for the Entertainment segment, including Hulu Live fees, amortization of production costs, and intercompany payments for sports programming.",
        "Step 2: From DIS_10k_2024, identify the composition of programming and production costs for the Sports segment, which focuses on amortization of licensed sports rights and live sports production.",
        "Step 3: From CMCSA_10k_2024, note that Comcast also reports programming and production costs as a distinct financial category (evident from its inclusion in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements as Note 4), although the detailed breakdown is not shown in the excerpt.",
        "Step 4: Compare the treatment of these costs between the two companies, noting that Disney provides a more granular breakdown of cost components tied to specific business activities, while Comcast's disclosure is less detailed in the provided excerpt.",
        "Step 5: Synthesize the findings to explain how the cost structures differ between Disney's segments and how both compare to Comcast's general approach to content cost reporting."

      "answer": "CMCSA's programming and production obligations are significantly influenced by the number of subscribers, as fees for distributing third-party television networks are based on per-subscriber charges. With a large subscriber base, CMCSA expects total fees under these arrangements to be significantly higher than the minimum guaranteed commitments listed. Similarly, GOOGL's content acquisition costs for YouTube and Google Play are tied to the number of subscribers, as fees are paid to content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee, which scales with subscriber growth. Therefore, both companies experience increased financial obligations as their subscriber counts rise, though the mechanisms differ\u2014CMCSA through distribution fees and GOOGL through content licensing costs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from CMCSA evidence - Programming expenses are based on the number of subscribers receiving television network programming and a per-subscriber fee.",
        "Step 2: Extract from GOOGL evidence - Content acquisition costs include payments to providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee, which is influenced by the number of subscribers.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies' financial obligations are directly tied to the number of subscribers, with CMCSA's costs increasing due to per-subscriber distribution fees and GOOGL's rising due to content licensing tied to subscriber-based revenues."

Increased regulation of data utilization practices, including self-regulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability to collect, transfer and use personal information, could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, if we were to disclose personal information about our members in a manner that was objectionable to them, our business reputation could be adversely affected, and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results. Internationally, we may become subject to additional and/or more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of member and other personal information, such as laws regarding data localization, data transfer and/or restrictions on data export. Failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability, and to the ex tent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations, we could incur additional expenses.\n\n## Our reputation and relationships with members would be harmed if member personal information, particularly billing data, were to be accessed by unauthorized persons.\n\nWe maintain personal information regarding our members, including names, age, gender and billing information. This personal information is maintained on our own systems as well as that of third parties we use in our operations. With respect to billing information, such as credit card numbers, we rely on encryption and authentication technology to secure such information. We take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our members' information. Despite these measures and technologies we, our payment processing services or other third-party services we use such as AWS, could experience an unauthorized intrusion into our members' information. In the event of such a breach, current and potential members may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to remain or become members. We have notified and may in the future be required to notify regulators about any actual or perceived data breach (including various state Attorneys General, one or more EU data protection authorities, or other data protection authorities) as well as the individuals who are affected by the incident within strict time periods. Additionally, we could face legal claims or regulatory fines or penalties for such a breach. The costs relating to any data breach could be material, and we currently do not carry insurance against the risk of a data breach. We also maintain personal information concerning our employees, as well as personal information of others working on our productions. Should an unauthorized intrusion into our members' or employees' personal information and/or production personal information occur, our business could be adversely affected and our larger reputation with respect to data protection could be negatively impacted.\n\n## Risks Related to Liquidity\n\n## The long-term and largely fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.\n\nIn connection with licensing streaming content, we typically enter into multi-year commitments with studios and other content providers. We also enter into multi-year commitments for content that we produce, either directly or through third parties, including elements associated with these productions such as noncancelable commitments under talent agreements. The payment terms of these agreements are not tied to member usage or the size of our membership base ('fixed cost') but may be determined by costs of production or tied to such factors as titles licensed and/or theatrical ex hibition receipts. Such commitments, to the ex tent estimable under accounting standards, are included in the Contractual Obligations section of Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Given the multiple-year duration and largely fixed cost nature of content commitments, if business performance does not meet our expectations, our margins may be adversely impacted. Further, we may be unable to react to any reduction in our cash flows from operations, including those caused by a downturn in the economy, by reducing our streaming content obligations in the near-term. Payment terms for certain content commitments, such as content we directly produce, will typically require more up-front cash payments than other content licenses or arrangements whereby we do not fund the production of such content. To the extent revenue growth does not meet our expectations, our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content commitments and accelerated payment requirements of certain agreements. In addition, the long-term and largely fix ed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our flex ibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate. If we license and/or produce content that is not favorably received by consumers in a territory, or is unable to be shown in a territory, acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted and given the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments, we may not be able to adjust our content offerings quickly and our results of operations may be adversely impacted.\n\n## We may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders.\n\nFrom time to time, we may seek to obtain additional capital, either through equity, equity-linked or debt securities. The decision to obtain additional capital will depend on, among other things, our business plans, operating performance and condition of the capital markets. Rising interest rates or any disruption in the capital markets could make it more difficult and expensive for us to raise additional capital or refinance",

      "answer": "NFLX recognizes all operating lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term, including for short-term leases with an initial term of twelve months or less, even though these are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In contrast, VZ recognizes rent expense for short-term operating leases on a straight-line basis as well, but classifies the expense in either Cost of services or Selling, general and administrative expense based on the use of the facility or equipment. This means that while both companies follow a similar straight-line recognition method, the presentation on the income statement differs depending on the nature and use of the leased asset, which could impact how analysts assess their operating performance and cost structures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From NFLX's filing, we learn that short-term operating leases (12 months or less) are not recorded on the balance sheet but are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term.",
        "Step 2: From VZ's filing, we see that short-term operating lease expenses are also recognized on a straight-line basis, but the expense is classified based on the use of the facility or equipment, appearing either in Cost of services or Selling, general and administrative expense.",
        "Step 3: Synthesizing both, we observe that while the expense timing is consistent (straight-line), the income statement classification varies, which affects how analysts might interpret operating margins and cost categories for each company."

These leases generally have terms which range from 1 year to 15 years, and often include one or more options to renew. These renewal terms can extend the lease term from 1 year to 20 years, and are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. These operating leases are included in \"Other non-current assets\" on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets, and represent the Company's right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The Company's obligations to make lease payments are included in \"Accrued expenses and other liabilities\" and \"Other non-current liabilities\" on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company has entered into various short-term operating leases with an initial term of twelve months or less. These leases are not recorded on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. All operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Because the rate implicit in each lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments. The Company has certain contracts for real estate which may contain lease and non-lease components which it has elected to treat as a single lease component.\n\nThe components of lease costs for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\n\n",

M anagement uses the unsecured borrowing rate and risk-adjusts that rate to approximate a collateralized rate, which is updated on a quarterly basis.\n\nIn those circumstances where V erizon is the lessee, we account for non-lease components associated with our leases (e.g., common area maintenance costs) and lease components as a single lease component for substantially all of our asset classes. A dditionally , in arrangements where we are the lessor, we have customer premise equipment for which we account for non-lease components (e.g., service revenue) and lease components as combined components under the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 606 as the service revenues are the predominant components in the arrangements.\n\nRent expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and is included in either Cost of services or Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income, based on the use of the facility or equipment on which rent is being paid. V ariable rent payments related to both operating and finance leases are expensed in the period incurred. Our variable lease payments consist of payments dependent on various external indicators, including real estate taxes, common area maintenance charges and utility usage.\n\nOperating leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheets; we recognize rent expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nWe recognize the amortization of the right-of-use asset for our finance leases on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the right-of-use  asset  in  Depreciation  and  amortization  expense  in  our  consolidated  statements  of  income.  The  interest  expense  related  to  finance  leases  is recognized using the effective interest method based on the discount rate determined at lease commencement and is included within Interest expense in our consolidated statements of income.\n\nSee Note 6 for additional information related to leases, including disclosure required under Topic 842.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nFair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability  in an orderly  transaction between market participants. The three-tier hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value, which prioritizes the inputs used in the methodologies of measuring fair value for assets and liabilities, is as follows:\n\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities\n\nLevel 3 - Unobservable pricing inputs in the market\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurements requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities being measured and their categorization within the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nOur effective tax rate is based on pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.\n\nDeferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences in the basis between financial statement and income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes are recalculated annually at tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\n\nWe use a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is recognition: we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The second step is measurement: a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements will generally result in one or more of the following: an increase in a liability for income taxes payable, a reduction of an income tax refund receivable, a reduction in a deferred tax asset or an increase in a deferred tax liability.\n\nSignificant management judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and in determining our effective tax rate.",

      "answer": "AT&T reported a video segment operating income of $2,257 million in 2023. In contrast, Comcast disclosed that its traditional linear video services are experiencing accelerated customer losses, declining video revenues, and reduced subscriber fees from other video service providers due to increasing consumer adoption of DTC streaming and OTT services. This contrast highlights differing financial outcomes despite both companies facing similar industry-wide pressures from the shift to streaming platforms.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Comcast discloses declining video revenues, customer losses, and reduced subscriber fees from traditional linear video services due to consumer shift toward DTC streaming and OTT services.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - AT&T reports $2,257 million in operating income from its video segment for 2023.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Despite facing similar industry challenges, AT&T's video segment remained profitable in 2023 while Comcast's disclosures indicate ongoing deterioration in its traditional video business."

      "answer": "CMCSA's video revenue decreased in both 2022 and 2023, primarily due to declines in the overall number of residential video customers. This downward trend reflects ongoing challenges in the traditional video services market. In contrast, AT&T reported $2,257 million in video revenue in 2021 but no longer reports a separate video segment by 2023, indicating a strategic shift away from this business line. While CMCSA continues to experience revenue declines in video services, AT&T's discontinuation of video segment reporting suggests a more definitive exit from or integration of its video offerings into other business units.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nThe Company recognizes content assets (licensed and produced) as 'Content assets, net' on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, the Company capitalizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, the Company capitalizes costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and production overhead. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, the Company amortizes the content assets (licensed and produced) in 'Cost of revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as the Company typically expects more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability. The Company reviews factors impacting the amortization of the content assets on an ongoing basis. The Company's estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\n\nThe Company's business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed in aggregate at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, the Company has not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nThe Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. In addition, uncertain tax positions, tax-related valuation allowances and pre-acquisition contingencies are initially recorded in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.\n\n## Property and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally up to 30 years, or the expected lease term for leasehold improvements, if applicable.\n\n## Trade Receivables\n\nTrade receivables consist primarily of amounts related to members and payment partners that collect membership fees on the Company's behalf. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance for credit losses based on historical collection trends, the financial condition of its payment partners, and external market factors. The Company's allowance for credit losses was not material as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\n\n## Marketing\n\nMarketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to the Company's partners, including consumer electronics (\"CE\") manufacturers, multichannel video programming distributors (\"MVPDs\"), mobile operators and internet service providers (\"ISPs\"). Advertising expenses include promotional activities such as digital and television advertising. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $1,669 million, $1,447 million and $1,879 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Marketing expenses also include payroll and related expenses for personnel that support the Company's marketing activities.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nThe Company records a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nadversely impacted. Payment terms for certain content commitments, such as content we directly produce, will typically require more up-front cash payments than other content licenses or arrangements whereby we do not cashflow the production of such content. To the extent membership and/or revenue growth do not meet our expectations, our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content commitments and accelerated payment requirements of certain agreements. In addition, the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate. If we license and/or produce content that is not favorably received by consumers in a territory, or is unable to be shown in a territory, acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted and given the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments, we may not be able to adjust our content offering quickly and our results of operation may be adversely impacted.\n\n## We may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders.\n\nFrom time to time, we may seek to obtain additional capital, either through equity, equity-linked or debt securities. For several years prior to 2020, our cash flows from operations were negative and to the extent that it becomes negative in the future we may need to seek additional capital. The decision to obtain additional capital will depend on, among other things, our business plans, operating performance and condition of the capital markets. Any disruption in the capital markets could make it more difficult and expensive for us to raise additional capital or refinance our existing indebtedness. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equitylinked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution. Any large equity or equity-linked offering could also negatively impact our stock price.\n\n## We have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, which could adversely affect our financial position.\n\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations. Moreover, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future and incur other obligations, including additional streaming content obligations. If the financial markets become difficult or costly to access, our ability to raise additional capital may be negatively impacted. As of December 31, 2021, we had the equivalent of $15.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding ('Notes'), some of which is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, we have entered into a revolving credit agreement that provides for a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2021, we have not borrowed any amount under this revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $7.4 billion of total content liabilities as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet, some of which is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Such amount does not include streaming content commitments that do not meet the criteria for liability recognition, the amounts of which are significant. For more information on our streaming content obligations, including those not on our consolidated balance sheet, see Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our substantial indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, may:\n\n- make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our Notes and our other obligations;\n- limit our ability to borrow additional funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n- increase our cost of borrowing;\n- limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n- require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments and pay our other obligations when due;\n- limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;\n- place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and\n- increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.\n\nOur streaming obligations include large multi-year commitments. As a result, we may be unable to react to any downturn in the economy or reduction in our cash flows from operations by reducing our streaming content obligations in the near-term. This could result in our needing to access the capital markets at an unfavorable time, which may negatively impact our stock price.",

          "chunk_text": "The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR in 2023. Although our securities may provide for alternative methods of calculating the interest rate payable on such indebtedness, uncertainty as to the extent and manner of future changes may adversely affect the current trading market for LIBOR-based securities and the value of variable rate indebtedness in general. A company's cost of borrowing is also affected by evaluations given by various credit rating agencies and these agencies have been applying tighter credit standards when evaluating debt levels and future growth prospects. While we have been successful in continuing to access the credit and fixed income markets when needed, adverse changes in the financial markets could render us either unable to access these markets or able to access these markets only at higher interest costs and with restrictive financial or other conditions, severely affecting our business operations. Additionally, downgrades of our credit rating by the major credit rating agencies could increase our cost of borrowing and also impact the collateral we would be required to post under certain agreements we have entered into with our derivative counterparties, which could negatively impact our liquidity. Further, valuation changes in our derivative portfolio due to interest rates and foreign exchange rates could require us to post collateral and thus may negatively impact our liquidity.\n\n## Our international operations have increased our exposure to political instability, to changes in the international economy and to the level of regulation on our business and these risks could offset our expected growth opportunities.\n\nWe have international operations, including in Mexico, and worldwide through WarnerMedia's content distribution. We need to comply with a wide variety of complex local laws, regulations and treaties. We are exposed to restrictions on cash repatriation, foreign exchange controls, fluctuations in currency values, changes in relationships between U.S. and foreign governments, trade restrictions including potential tariffs, differences in intellectual property protection laws, and other regulations that may affect materially our earnings. Our Mexico operations, in particular, rely on a continuation of a regulatory regime that fosters competition. While our foreign operations represent significant opportunities to sell our services, a number of foreign countries where we operate have experienced unstable growth patterns, increased inflation, currency devaluation, foreign exchange controls, instability in the banking sector and high unemployment. Should these conditions persist, our ability to offer service in one or more countries could be adversely affected and customers in these countries may be unable to purchase the services we offer or pay for services already provided.\n\nIn addition, operating in foreign countries also typically involves participating with local businesses, either to comply with local laws or, for example, to enhance product marketing, deploy networks or execute on other capital projects. Involvement with foreign firms exposes us to the risk of being unable to control the actions of those firms and therefore exposes us to risks associated with our obligation to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Violations of the FCPA could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\n\n## Industry-wide Factors:\n\n## Our business is subject to risks arising from the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and resulting mitigation measures have caused, and may continue to cause, a negative effect on our operating results. At the onset in 2020, mitigation measures caused sports leagues to modify their seasons and suspend certain operations, which adversely affected our advertising revenues and, resulted in contract disputes concerning carriage rights that caused us to incur expenses relating to certain of these sporting events notwithstanding their cancellation. The closure or avoidance of theaters, and the interruptions in movie production and other programming caused by COVID-19 are expected to continue to impact the timing of revenues and may cause a loss of revenue to our WarnerMedia business over the long term. The COVID-19 pandemic also drove higher costs for our WarnerMedia business in 2021 based on the hybrid distribution model for releasing films in 2021 and costs associated with safety measures put in place to help provide a safe environment for content production. If the mitigation measures or the associated effects are prolonged, we expect business customers in industries most significantly impacted will continue to reduce or terminate services, having a negative effect on the performance of our Business Wireline business unit. Further, concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic could again result in the closure of many of our retail stores, temporarily or permanently, and deter customers from accessing our stores even as the pandemic subsides. These pandemic concerns may also result in continued impact to our customers' ability to pay for our products and services. We may also continue to see significant impact on roaming revenues due to a downturn in international travel. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused and could further cause reduced staffing levels at our call centers and field operations, resulting in delays in service. Further reductions in staffing levels could additionally limit our ability to provide services, adversely impacting our competitive position. We may also incur significantly higher expenses attributable to infrastructure investments required to meet higher network utilization from more customers consuming bandwidth from changes in work from home trends; extended cancellation periods; and increased labor costs if the COVID-19 pandemic continues for an extended period.",

      "answer": "Disney discloses that advertising revenues are a significant component of its service revenues, alongside affiliate fees, subscription fees, and other revenue streams tied to media networks and entertainment offerings. This indicates that advertising plays a key but not dominant role in its service-based revenue model. In contrast, Google explicitly states that advertising revenues from Google Search, Network properties, and YouTube ads are its largest source of cash provided by operations, highlighting a much more central and foundational role of advertising in Google\u2019s financial structure. Therefore, while both companies rely on advertising revenues, Disney integrates it as one of several major revenue streams, whereas Google positions it as the core driver of its operating cash flows.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Disney identifies 'advertising revenues' as one of several significant service revenue streams, including affiliate fees, subscription fees, and licensing revenue.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Google states that advertising revenues from Search, Network properties, and YouTube ads are its 'largest source of cash provided by operations', indicating a central financial role.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Comparing both disclosures reveals that while advertising is important to both companies, it is structurally central to Google\u2019s operations, whereas Disney treats it as one of multiple significant revenue sources."

Alphabet, on the other hand, recognizes advertising revenues based on user engagement for performance ads (e.g., clicks or views) and on ad display for brand advertising, with revenue recognition timing tied directly to ad delivery rather than subscriber counts or guaranteed license fees.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Alphabet Inc.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\n\n## Basis of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nPreparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  GAAP  requires  us  to  make  estimates  and assumptions  that  affect  the  amounts  reported  and  disclosed  in  the  financial  statements  and  the  accompanying  notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties, including the effects of COVID-19. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; fair values of financial instruments, intangible assets, and goodwill; useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment; income taxes; and contingent liabilities, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\n\nIn  January  2021,  we  completed  an  assessment  of  the  useful  lives  of  our  servers  and  network  equipment  and adjusted the estimated useful life  of  our  servers  from  three  years  to  four  years  and  the  estimated  useful  life  of  certain network equipment from three years to five years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal year 2021. Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 2020 and those acquired during the year ended December 31, 2021, the effect of this change in estimate was a reduction in depreciation expense of $2.6 billion and an increase in net income of $2.0 billion, or $3.02 per basic share and $2.98 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, and the collectibility  of  an  amount  that  we  expect  in  exchange  for  those  goods  or  services  is  probable.  Sales  and  other  similar taxes are excluded from revenues.\n\n## Advertising Revenues\n\nWe generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on:\n\n- Google Search and other properties, including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use  Google.com  as  their  default  search  in  browsers,  toolbars,  etc.  and  other  Google  owned  and  operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n- YouTube properties; and\n- Google Network properties, including revenues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\n\nOur  customers  generally  purchase  advertising  inventory  through  Google  Ads,  Google  Ad  Manager,  and  Google Marketing Platform, among others.\n\nWe offer advertising by delivering both performance and brand advertising. We recognize revenues for performance advertising when a user engages with the advertisement, such as a click, a view, or a purchase. For brand advertising, we recognize revenues when the ad is displayed, or a user views the ad.\n\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed on Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues, and amounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing.",
