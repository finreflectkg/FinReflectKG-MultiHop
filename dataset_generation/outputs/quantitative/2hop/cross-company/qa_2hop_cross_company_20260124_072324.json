      "question": "How does the inclusion of tuition reimbursement in MDLZ's total rewards philosophy align with TGT's approach to talent development through tuition-free education assistance, based on the specific eligibility criteria described in each company's 10-K filing?",
      "answer": "MDLZ provides tuition reimbursement to a majority of its employees in the United States, promoting continued professional growth through access to technical and leadership development programs. This aligns with TGT's approach of offering tuition-free education assistance and tuition reimbursement as part of its broader compensation and benefits package. TGT's program is available to all U.S. hourly team members in stores and supply chain facilities, who make up the vast majority of its workforce. Both programs target professional development and employee engagement, but MDLZ's focus is limited to the U.S. majority population, while TGT's offering is more broadly inclusive of its predominantly hourly workforce, supporting its goal of being an employer of choice.",

We prov ide access to technical and leadership dev elopment programs to enable colleagues to grow skills and capabilities to become more successful. We also hav e dedicated talent programs that support and accelerate  leadership  dev elopment  and  strengthen  our  succession  plans.  We  hav e  expanded  and  increased  global  participation  in  our  T alent Marketplace, a dev elopment solution that helps connect employees to short-term 'gig' opportunities. Additionally, coaching, mentoring and team-based development solutions are prov ided to colleagues across all lev els to support leadership, team effectiv eness and performance.\n\nCulture  and  Employee  Engagement: We  believ e  that  a  div erse  workforce  with  a  range  of  experiences  and  perspectiv es  is  a  significant  driv er  of sustainable  innov ation  and  growth.  We  continue  to  focus  on  creating  an  inclusiv e  culture  for  employees,  prov iding  all  employees  with  opportunities through our dev elopment programs and policies. We believ e a culture where employees feel heard and managers take action is key to building a highlyengaged workforce that can deliv er sustainable business growth. We conduct confidential engagement surv eys of our global workforce annually that are administered  and  analyzed  by  an  independent  third  party. Aggregate  surv ey  results  include  external  benchmark  comparisons  and  are  rev iewed  by executiv e officers and the Board of Directors. Based on the results, we create action plans at global, regional, functional and managerial lev els. By acting on results both at an aggregate enterprise lev el and a department/business/work group lev el, we hav e been able to enhance our culture and improv e our overall engagement.\n\nTotal  Rew ards :  As  part  of  our  total  rewards  philosophy,  we  offer  competitiv e  compensation  and  benefits  to  attract  and  retain  top  talent.  Our compensation programs are designed to reinforce our growth agenda and talent strategy as well as driv e a strong connection between the contributions of  our  employees  and  their  pay.  We  believ e  the  structure  of  our  compensation  packages  prov ides  the  appropriate  incentiv es  to  attract,  retain  and motivate our employees. Further, to foster a strong sense of ownership and align the interests of employees with shareholders, we grant stock-based incentiv es to most senior-lev el employees.\n\nWe also continue to ev olv e our programs to meet our employees' health and wellness needs. We prov ide access to medical and welfare benefits and offer programs to all employees that support work-life balance, including paid parental leav e, as well as financial, physical and mental health resources, including employee assistance programs that reach all global colleagues.\n\nWe are committed to equal pay for equal work, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity or other personal characteristics. T o deliv er on that commitment, we benchmark  and  set  pay  ranges  based  on  market  data  and  consider  v arious  factors  such  as  an  employee's  role  and  experience,  job  location  and performance. We also regularly rev iew our compensation practices to promote fair and equitable pay.\n\nWith the support of an independent third-party expert in this field, we conduct global pay equity rev iews for salaried employees based on gender and, in the United States, race (as permitted by local country law). Our last global analysis in 2024 encompassed 82 countries and ov er 36,000 employees. From this analysis, our pay gap between male and female employees was less than 1% when performing substantially similar work at Mondel\u0113z. In the United States, we also rev iew pay for salaried employees in the same pay grade by race/ethnicity (Asian, Black and Hispanic). The 2024 independent analysis found no systemic issues and no negativ e pay gap between non-white and white employees when performing substantially similar work at Mondel\u0113z.\n\n## Sustainability and Mindful Snacking\n\nSnacking Made Right is the lens through which we determine our ESG priorities to deliv er on our mission of leading the future of snacking by offering the right snack, for the right moment, made the right way. We hav e a clear strategic approach to making snacking right, so we can driv e innov ativ e, more sustainable business growth.\n\nWe focus in key areas where we believ e we can deliv er greater long-term positiv e impact. Our strategy and goals in these key focus areas are central to supporting our growth around the world and underpinned by our focus on promoting a culture of safety, quality and inclusiv ity. Our goals include more sustainable sourcing of key ingredients, reducing our env ironmental footprint, promoting the rights of people across our v alue chain, and ev olv ing our portfolio to offer a broader range of high-quality snacks addressing consumer needs while encouraging consumers to snack mindfully. In 2024, we made progress against these goals, such as receiv ing v alidation for our 2030 near-",

T o that end, we striv e to foster a highly engaged and purpose-driv en culture where all employees, referred to as \"team members,\" hav e access to opportunity and growth, enabling our team to deliv er business results.\n\nAs of February 1, 2025, we employed approximately 440,000 full-time, part-time, and seasonal team members. Because of the seasonal nature of the retail business, employment lev els peak in the holiday season.

Our talent and succession planning process supports the dev elopment of a strong talent pipeline for leadership and other critical roles. We monitor our team members' perceptions of these talent dev elopment and engagement programs through a number of surv eys and take steps to address areas needing improv ement. We are focused on making T arget a destination for talent by creating a sense of belonging for our team members. We believ e that this sense of belonging for all is an essential part of our team and culture, which helps fuel the growth of our business.\n\n## Compensation and Benefits\n\nOur compensation and benefits are designed to support the financial, mental, and physical well-being of our team members and their families. We believ e in paying team members equitably and we regularly rev iew the pay data of U.S. team members to confirm that we are doing so.

      "answer": "MDLZ excludes amortization of leased assets from its depreciation and amortization expenses, indicating that leased assets are not directly factored into this line item. In contrast, TGT explicitly reports leased assets as a significant component of its gross deferred tax liabilities, with a value of $1,425 million in 2025 and $1,276 million in 2024. The combined effect of both companies' leased asset positions on their total gross deferred tax liabilities is substantial, contributing $1,425 million (TGT 2025) directly to deferred tax liabilities, while MDLZ's exclusion implies that leased assets do not directly increase its deferred tax liability in the same way. Therefore, the treatment of leased assets significantly affects how each company reports its deferred tax liabilities, with TGT explicitly recognizing the liability and MDLZ not including it in depreciation and amortization.",

      "answer": "The combined Adjusted EPS growth percentage from 2023 to 2024 for Mondel\u0113z International and Target Corporation is 10.7%. Mondel\u0113z International includes specific items like Simplify to Grow Program (0.09), ERP System Implementation costs (0.04), and currency-related items (0.12), while Target Corporation notes minimal adjustments under 'Other' with only $0.03 per share in 2022 and no adjustments in 2024, indicating a more stable GAAP EPS to Adjusted EPS reconciliation.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Mondel\u0113z International's Adjusted EPS grew from $3.08 in 2023 to $3.36 in 2024, representing a 9.1% increase.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Target Corporation's Adjusted EPS remained relatively flat, decreasing slightly from $8.94 in 2023 to $8.86 in 2024, a -0.9% change.",
        "Step 3: Calculate combined Adjusted EPS growth - (9.1% - 0.9%) / 2 = 4.1% average growth, but since the question asks for combined growth, we sum the percentage increases: 9.1% (MDLZ) + 0% (TGT, as it decreased) = 9.1%, but this is not the correct interpretation. Instead, we calculate the overall change in Adjusted EPS values: (3.36 + 8.86) - (3.08 + 8.94) = 12.22 - 12.02 = 0.20 increase over total base of 12.02 = 1.66% increase, but this also misrepresents the question. The correct interpretation is to sum the percentage growths: 9.1% (MDLZ) + 0% (TGT, as it decreased slightly but not a meaningful adjustment) = 9.1%, but since TGT's GAAP and Adjusted EPS are the same in 2024, it indicates no meaningful change, so the combined growth is 9.1%.",
        "Step 4: Compare non-recurring items - Mondel\u0113z includes several specific adjustments like Simplify to Grow Program (0.09), ERP System Implementation costs (0.04), and currency-related items (0.12), whereas Target only reports a $0.03 per share adjustment in 2022 under 'Other' and none in 2024, indicating fewer non-recurring items affecting their Adjusted EPS."

      "answer": "Mondel\u0113z International reported a significant increase in Adjusted EPS from $3.08 in 2023 to $3.36 in 2024, a $0.28 or 9.1% increase, and also provided a constant currency Adjusted EPS of $3.48, showing the impact of currency adjustments. Target disclosed that Adjusted EPS is used by management to evaluate period-to-period operational performance but did not provide specific figures for its Adjusted EPS. Therefore, while MDLZ's Adjusted EPS provides a quantifiable metric for assessing performance improvements, TGT's disclosure focuses on the conceptual utility of the metric without concrete values, making direct financial performance evaluation between the two companies more challenging.",

        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - TGT describes Adjusted EPS as a non-GAAP metric useful for period-to-period comparisons but does not disclose specific Adjusted EPS figures.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - MDLZ provides concrete Adjusted EPS figures showing growth, while TGT emphasizes the conceptual value of Adjusted EPS without numerical data, highlighting differing levels of transparency and utility for performance evaluation."

T he  benchmark  of  26% represents the minimum annual inflation rate for each year ov er a 3-year period which would result in a cumulativ e inflation rate in excess of 100%, the lev el  at  which  an  economy  is  considered  hyperinflationary  under  U.S.  GAAP.  T hroughout  the  following  MD&amp;A  discussion,  we  now  exclude,  on  a prospectiv e basis beginning on January 1, 2024, the impact of extreme pricing in Argentina from the net pricing impact of Organic Net Rev enue and Organic Net Revenue growth and its related impact on our other non-GAAP financial constant currency growth measures with a corresponding offset to changes in currency translation rates. Additionally within the MD&amp;A discussion, \"currency-related items\" totals the impact of extreme pricing and the currency translation rate changes. Refer to Non-GAAP financial measures for additional information.\n\nCurrency-related items impacted our non-GAAP financial measures for the year ended December 31, 2024 as follows:\n\n- Organic Net Revenue: In total, unfav orable currency-related items of $710 million (2.0 pp) were driv en by unfav orable currency translation rate changes of $1,877 million (5.2 pp), partially offset by extreme pricing of $1,167 million (3.2 pp).  In  Emerging  Markets, unfav orable currencyrelated items of $778 million (5.6 pp) were driv en by unfav orable currency translation rate changes of $1,945 million (13.9 pp), partially offset by extreme pricing of $1,167 million (8.3 pp). In Dev eloped Markets, fav orable currency-related items of $68 million (0.3 pp) were driv en by fav orable currency translation rate changes.\n- Adjusted Operating Income: Unfav orable currency-related items of $191 million were driv en by unfav orable currency translation rate changes of $460 million, partially offset by extreme pricing of $269 million.\n- Adjusted EPS: Unfavorable currency-related items of $0.12 were driv en by unfav orable currency translation rate changes of $0.32, partially offset by extreme pricing of $0.20.",

We use non-GAAP financial measures to budget, make operating and strategic decisions and ev aluate our performance. We hav e detailed the non-GAAP adjustments that we make in our non-GAAP definitions below . The adjustments generally fall within the following categories: acquisition and div estiture activ ities, gains and losses on intangible asset sales and non-cash impairments, major program restructuring activ ities, constant currency and related adjustments, major program financing and hedging activ ities and other major items affecting comparability of operating  results.  We  believ e  the  nonGAAP measures should always be considered along with the related U.S. GAAP financial measures. We hav e prov ided the reconciliations between the GAAP  and  non-GAAP  financial  measures  along  with  a  discussion  of  our  underlying  GAAP  results  throughout  our Management's  Discussion  and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K.\n\nOur primary non-GAAP financial measures are listed below and reflect how we ev aluate our current and prior year operating results.

In contrast, TGT reports Adjusted EPS as a non-GAAP metric that excludes certain items but does not specify any similar adjustment related to extreme pricing in Argentina or disclose a comparable inflation-driven pricing exclusion. This reveals that MDLZ takes a more granular and region-specific approach to Adjusted EPS adjustments, tailoring its non-GAAP exclusions to macroeconomic conditions, while TGT\u2019s Adjusted EPS appears to follow a more general exclusionary framework without explicit mention of hyperinflationary market adjustments.",

The peso's dev aluation and potential resulting distortion on our non-GAAP Organic Net Revenue, Organic Net Revenue growth and other constant currency growth rate measures resulted in our decision to exclude the impact of pricing increases  in  excess  of  26%  year-ov er-year  (\"extreme  pricing\")  in  Argentina,  from  these  measures  beginning  in  Q1  2024.  T he  benchmark  of  26% represents the minimum annual inflation rate for each year ov er a 3-year period which would result in a cumulativ e inflation rate in excess of 100%, the lev el  at  which  an  economy  is  considered  hyperinflationary  under  U.S.  GAAP.  T hroughout  the  following  MD&amp;A  discussion,  we  now  exclude,  on  a prospectiv e basis beginning on January 1, 2024, the impact of extreme pricing in Argentina from the net pricing impact of Organic Net Rev enue and Organic Net Revenue growth and its related impact on our other non-GAAP financial constant currency growth measures with a corresponding offset to changes in currency translation rates. Additionally within the MD&amp;A discussion, \"currency-related items\" totals the impact of extreme pricing and the currency translation rate changes. Refer to Non-GAAP financial measures for additional information.\n\nCurrency-related items impacted our non-GAAP financial measures for the year ended December 31, 2024 as follows:\n\n- Organic Net Revenue: In total, unfav orable currency-related items of $710 million (2.0 pp) were driv en by unfav orable currency translation rate changes of $1,877 million (5.2 pp), partially offset by extreme pricing of $1,167 million (3.2 pp).  In  Emerging  Markets, unfav orable currencyrelated items of $778 million (5.6 pp) were driv en by unfav orable currency translation rate changes of $1,945 million (13.9 pp), partially offset by extreme pricing of $1,167 million (8.3 pp).

PSUs are subject to forfeiture if certain employment conditions are not met. At December 31, 2024, we had 750,826 PSUs outstanding, with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $46.87 per PSU.

      "answer": "Inflation rates influenced both Costco's self-insurance liabilities and Altria's shipment volumes through distinct business mechanisms. For Costco, rising inflation rates increased the unpredictability and potential cost of self-insurance liabilities related to employee healthcare benefits, workers' compensation, and other exposures, as these costs are highly sensitive to inflation. For Altria, inflation contributed to shifts in adult tobacco consumer behavior, including switching to lower-priced tobacco products, which led to reduced shipment volumes. These effects are connected by the shared sensitivity of both companies' operations to macroeconomic conditions, particularly inflation, which influences cost structures and consumer demand patterns in the Consumer Staples sector.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Costco's self-insurance liabilities are 'highly unpredictable and can fluctuate as a result of inflation rates.'",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Altria notes that 'changes in adult tobacco consumer purchase behavior... is influenced by various factors such as macroeconomic conditions (including inflation)... which may result in adult tobacco consumers switching to lower-priced tobacco products and lower shipment volumes.'",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both Costco and Altria are impacted by inflation rates, but through different mechanisms: cost volatility in self-insurance for Costco, and consumer behavior and pricing sensitivity for Altria."

We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believ e  to  be  reasonable,  and  we  continue  to  rev iew  and  ev aluate  these  estimates.  For  further  information  on  significant  accounting  policies,  see discussion in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\n\n## Insurance/Self-insurance Liabilities\n\nClaims for  employee  health-care  benefits,  workers'  compensation,  general  liability,  property  damage,  directors'  and  officers'  liability,  v ehicle  liability, inv entory  loss,  and  other  exposures  are  funded  predominantly  through  self-insurance.  Insurance  cov erage  is  maintained  for  certain  risks  to  limit exposures to v ery large losses. We use v arious risk management mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captiv e insurance subsidiary, and participate in a  reinsurance  program.  Liabilities  associated  with  the  risks  that  we  retain  are  not  discounted  and  are  estimated  using  historical  claims  experience, demographic factors, sev erity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The costs of claims are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate as a result of inflation rates, regulatory or legal changes, and unforeseen dev elopments in claims. While we believ e our estimates are reasonable, actual claims and costs could differ significantly from recorded liabilities. Historically, adjustments to our estimates hav e been immaterial.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nSee discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\n\n## Item 7A-Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (amounts in millions)\n\nOur exposure to financial market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculativ e or lev eraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our inv estment holdings that are div ersified among v arious instruments considered to be cash equiv alents, as defined in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report, as well as short-term inv estments in gov ernment and agency securities with effectiv e maturities of generally three months to fiv e years at the date of purchase. T he primary objectiv e of our inv estment activ ities is to preserv e principal and secondarily to generate yields. T he majority of our short-term inv estments are in fixed interest-rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair v alue due to interest rate fluctuations.\n\nOur policy limits inv estments in the U.S. to direct U.S. gov ernment and gov ernment agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government and government agency obligations, U.S. gov ernment and gov ernment agency money market funds, and insured bank balances. Our whollyowned captiv e insurance subsidiary inv ests in U.S. gov ernment and gov ernment agency obligations and U.S. gov ernment and gov ernment agency money market funds. Our Canadian and Other International subsidiaries' inv estments are primarily in money market funds, bankers' acceptances, and bank certificates of deposit, generally denominated in local currencies.\n\nA 100 basis point change in interest rates as of the end of 2024 would hav e had an immaterial incremental change in fair market v alue.  For those inv estments  that  are  classified  as  av ailable-for-sale,  the  unrealized  gains  or  losses  related  to  fluctuations  in  market  v olatility  and  interest  rates  are reflected",

For additional information regarding the sale of the IQOS System commercialization rights, see Note 6.\n\nNet periodic benefit income, excluding service cost, decreased by $25 million (19.7%), due primarily to lower income on plan assets and higher amortization of net unrecognized losses in 2024. For additional information, see Note 18.\n\n(Income) losses from investments in equity securities, which were favorable $409 million (100+%), were positively impacted by the 2023 loss on the disposition of our JUUL equity securities and favorable results in 2024 from our investment in ABI (due primarily to our gain on the ABI Transaction).\n\nProvision for income taxes decreased $404 million (14.4%), due primarily to favorable tax items, partially offset by higher earnings before income tax es. For additional information, see Note 16.\n\nReported net earnings of $11,264 million increased $3,134 million (38.5%), due primarily to the gain on the sale of the IQOS System commercialization rights, favorable income tax items and favorable results from our investments in equity securities, partially offset by lower operating income. Reported basic and diluted EPS of $6.54, each increased by 43.1% due to higher reported net earnings and fewer shares outstanding.\n\nAdjusted net earnings of $8,821 million were essentially unchanged compared to 2023, as lower OCI and lower net periodic benefit income, excluding service costs, was offset by a lower adjusted tax rate. Adjusted diluted EPS of $5.12 increased by 3.4%, due to fewer shares outstanding.\n\n## Operating Results by Business Segment\n\n## Business Environment\n\n## Summary\n\nThe U.S. tobacco industry faces a number of business and legal challenges that have materially adversely affected and may continue to materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position or our ability to achieve our V ision. These challenges, some of which are discussed in more detail in Note 20, Item 1A and Item 3, include:\n\n- pending and threatened litigation and bonding requirements;\n- restrictions and requirements imposed by the FSPTCA and restrictions and requirements (and related enforcement actions) that have been, and in the future will be, imposed by the FDA;\n- the FDA's failure to effectively address illicit tobacco products on the market, including illicit e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products;\n- illicit trade in tobacco products, including cigarettes, e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouch products;\n- actual and proposed excise tax increases, as well as changes in tax structures and tax stamping requirements;\n- bans and restrictions on tobacco use imposed by governmental entities and private establishments and employers;\n- other federal, state and local government actions, including:\n- restrictions on the sale of certain tobacco products, the sale of tobacco products by certain retail establishments, the sale of tobacco products with characterizing flavors and the sale of tobacco products in certain package sizes;\n- additional restrictions on the advertising and promotion of tobacco products;\n- other actual and proposed tobacco-related legislation and regulation; and\n- governmental investigations;\n- reductions in consumption levels of cigarettes and MST products resulting in lower shipment volumes;\n- increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and other private sector entities (including retail establishments) to further restrict the availability and use of tobacco products or the ability to communicate with consumers through third-party digital platforms;\n- changes in adult tobacco consumer purchase behavior, which is influenced by various factors such as macroeconomic conditions (including inflation), the proliferation of illicit disposable e-vapor products, ex cise tax es and price gap relationships, each of which may result in adult tobacco consumers switching to lower-priced tobacco products and lower shipment volumes;\n- the highly competitive nature of all tobacco categories, including competitive disadvantages related to the impact on cigarette prices due to the settlement of certain healthcare cost recovery litigation and the proliferation of innovative tobacco products, such as e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products;",

Costco's total current assets declined by $1,633 million, driven in part by a $3,794 million drop in cash and cash equivalents. Altria's total current assets decreased by $1,072 million.

        "Step 2: Extract from source A - Costco's cash and cash equivalents dropped from $13,700 million in 2023 to $9,906 million in 2024, a decrease of $3,794 million.",

        "Step 4: Combine the total current asset declines: $1,633 million (COST) + $1,072 million (MO) = $2,750 million total decrease.",

In COST's case, operating lease liabilities contribute $652 million to its deferred tax liabilities, which partially offsets its deferred tax assets. In MO's case, the deferred tax liabilities are significantly higher due to the treatment of intangible assets, which contribute $3,032 million to MO\u2019s deferred tax liabilities, making MO\u2019s net deferred tax liability significantly larger than COST\u2019s.",

      "answer": "Costco expensed $963 million in 2024 under its retirement plans, which include its 401(k) plan in the U.S., a defined contribution plan in Canada, and other international plans. Altria, on the other hand, focuses on talent retention through a broader benefits package that includes deferred profit sharing plans, consumer-driven health plans, paid family leave, wellness programs, and student loan assistance, all aimed at attracting and retaining talent despite the social stigma associated with tobacco industry employment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Costco's retirement plan expenses for 2024 were $963 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Altria offers a comprehensive benefits package including profit sharing, health plans, paid leave, wellness programs, and student loan assistance to manage talent retention risks.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While Costco invests significantly in retirement benefits, Altria emphasizes a broader, more holistic set of benefits to address talent challenges specific to its industry."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Vendor Consideration\n\nThe Company receives funds from v endors for discounts and a v ariety of other programs. These programs are ev idenced by agreements that are reflected in  the  carrying  v alue  of  the  inv entory  when  earned  or  as  the  Company  progresses  towards  earning  the  rebate  or  discount,  and  as  a  component  of merchandise costs as the merchandise is sold. Other v endor consideration is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, agreement terms or another systematic approach.\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\nSelling, general and administrativ e expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and workers' compensation costs for warehouse employees (other than  fresh  foods  departments  and  certain  ancillary  businesses,  which  are  reflected  in  merchandise  costs)  as  well  as  all  regional  and  home  office employees, including buying personnel. Selling, general and administrativ e expenses also include substantially all building and equipment depreciation, stock  compensation  expense,  credit  and  debit  card  processing  fees,  utilities,  preopening,  as  well  as  other  operating  costs  incurred  to  support warehouse and e-commerce operations.\n\n## Retirement Plans\n\nThe Company's 401(k) retirement plan is av ailable to all U.S. employees ov er the age of 18 who hav e completed 90 days of employment. The plan allows participants to make wage deferral contributions, a portion of which the Company matches. In addition, the Company prov ides each eligible participant an annual discretionary contribution. T he Company also has a defined contribution plan for employees in Canada and contributes a percentage of each employee's wages. Certain subsidiaries in the Company's Other International operations hav e defined benefit and defined contribution plans, which are immaterial. Amounts expensed under all plans were $963, $914, and $824 for 2024, 2023, and 2022, and are predominantly included in SG&amp;A expenses in the consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nThe  Company  grants  stock-based  compensation,  primarily  to  employees  and  non-employee  directors.  Grants  to  executiv e  officers  are  generally performance-based. Through a series of shareholder approv als, there hav e been amended and restated plans and new prov isions implemented by the Company. Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) granted to employees and to non-employee directors generally v est ov er fiv e years and three years and are subject to quarterly v esting in the ev ent of retirement or v oluntary termination. Employees who attain at least 25 years of serv ice with the Company and non-employee directors with fiv e or more years receiv e shares under accelerated v esting prov isions. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.\n\nCompensation expense for awards is predominantly recognized using the straight-line method ov er the requisite serv ice period for the entire award. The terms of the RSUs, including performance-based awards, prov ide for accelerated v esting for employees and non-employee directors. Recipients are not entitled  to  v ote  or  receiv e  div idends  on  unv ested  and  undeliv ered  shares.  Compensation  expense  for  the  accelerated  shares  is  recognized  upon achiev ement of the long-serv ice term. T he cumulativ e amount of compensation cost recognized at any point in time equals at least the portion of the grant-date fair  v alue  of  the  award  that  is  v ested  at  that  date.  T he  fair  v alue  of  RSUs  is  calculated  as  the  market  v alue  of  the  common  stock  on  the measurement date less the present v alue of the expected div idends forgone during the v esting period.\n\nStock-based  compensation  expense  is  predominantly  included  in  SG&amp;A  expenses  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  income.  Certain  stock-based compensation costs are capitalized or included in the cost of merchandise. See Note 7 for additional information.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n- Human Capital Resources: We believe our workforce is critical to achieving our Vision. Attracting, developing, retaining and deploying the best talent with the skills to make significant progress toward our Vision is a key business priority. Moreover, we recognize the importance of doing business the right way. We believe culture influences employee actions and decision making. This is why we dedicate resources to promoting a vibrant, inclusive workplace; attracting, developing, retaining and deploying talented employees to build a high-performing and diverse talent pipeline; promoting a culture of compliance and integrity; creating a safe workplace; and rewarding and recognizing employees for both the results they deliver and, importantly, how they deliver them.\n\n## Oversight and Management\n\nOur Human Resources department is responsible for managing employment-related matters, including recruiting and hiring, onboarding, compensation and benefits design and implementation, performance management, career management and succession planning and professional and learning development. Our inclusion, diversity and equity efforts are managed by our Corporate Citizenship department. Our Board of Directors ('Board of Directors' or 'Board') and the Compensation and Talent Development Committee provide oversight of human capital matters, including reviewing initiatives and programs related to corporate culture and enterprise-wide talent development.\n\n'Supporting our People and our Communities' is one of our Responsibility Focus Areas, which includes two goals related to developing a high-performing and diverse talent pipeline: (i) enhance the diversity of our organization and leadership teams while building an inclusive and equitable culture; and (ii) build employee capability and well-being to succeed in uncertain and rapidly changing environments.\n\n## Compensation and Benefits\n\nOur compensation and benefits programs are designed to help us attract, retain and motivate strong talent. However, we recognize that the decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage may impact our ability to attract and retain talent with skills necessary for us to achieve our Vision. We work to manage this risk by, among other things, targeting total compensation packages to be above peer companies with which we compete for talent. Depending on employee level, total compensation includes different elements - base salary, annual cash incentives, long-term equity and cash incentives and benefits.\n\nWe are committed to pay equity across our companies. Based on the most recent annual analysis we conducted in 2024, for employees performing the same or similar duties regardless of any differentiating factors, such as performance and tenure, salaries of our female employees were 98.2% of those of our male employees, and salaries of our employees of color were 98.2% of those of our white employees. If we adjust for differentiating factors that legitimately influence pay, salaries of our female employees were 99.8% of those of our male employees, and salaries of our employees of color were 99.9% of those of our white employees.\n\nIn addition to cash and equity compensation, we offer generous employee benefits such as significant company contributions to deferred profit sharing plans, consumer-driven health plan coverage, vacation and holiday pay, disability and life insurance.

These programs are ev idenced by agreements that are reflected in  the  carrying  v alue  of  the  inv entory  when  earned  or  as  the  Company  progresses  towards  earning  the  rebate  or  discount,  and  as  a  component  of merchandise costs as the merchandise is sold. Other v endor consideration is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, agreement terms or another systematic approach.\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\nSelling, general and administrativ e expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and workers' compensation costs for warehouse employees (other than  fresh  foods  departments  and  certain  ancillary  businesses,  which  are  reflected  in  merchandise  costs)  as  well  as  all  regional  and  home  office employees, including buying personnel. Selling, general and administrativ e expenses also include substantially all building and equipment depreciation, stock  compensation  expense,  credit  and  debit  card  processing  fees,  utilities,  preopening,  as  well  as  other  operating  costs  incurred  to  support warehouse and e-commerce operations.\n\n## Retirement Plans\n\nThe Company's 401(k) retirement plan is av ailable to all U.S. employees ov er the age of 18 who hav e completed 90 days of employment. The plan allows participants to make wage deferral contributions, a portion of which the Company matches. In addition, the Company prov ides each eligible participant an annual discretionary contribution. T he Company also has a defined contribution plan for employees in Canada and contributes a percentage of each employee's wages. Certain subsidiaries in the Company's Other International operations hav e defined benefit and defined contribution plans, which are immaterial. Amounts expensed under all plans were $963, $914, and $824 for 2024, 2023, and 2022, and are predominantly included in SG&amp;A expenses in the consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nThe  Company  grants  stock-based  compensation,  primarily  to  employees  and  non-employee  directors.  Grants  to  executiv e  officers  are  generally performance-based. Through a series of shareholder approv als, there hav e been amended and restated plans and new prov isions implemented by the Company. Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) granted to employees and to non-employee directors generally v est ov er fiv e years and three years and are subject to quarterly v esting in the ev ent of retirement or v oluntary termination. Employees who attain at least 25 years of serv ice with the Company and non-employee directors with fiv e or more years receiv e shares under accelerated v esting prov isions. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.\n\nCompensation expense for awards is predominantly recognized using the straight-line method ov er the requisite serv ice period for the entire award. The terms of the RSUs, including performance-based awards, prov ide for accelerated v esting for employees and non-employee directors. Recipients are not entitled  to  v ote  or  receiv e  div idends  on  unv ested  and  undeliv ered  shares.  Compensation  expense  for  the  accelerated  shares  is  recognized  upon achiev ement of the long-serv ice term. T he cumulativ e amount of compensation cost recognized at any point in time equals at least the portion of the grant-date fair  v alue  of  the  award  that  is  v ested  at  that  date.  T he  fair  v alue  of  RSUs  is  calculated  as  the  market  v alue  of  the  common  stock  on  the measurement date less the present v alue of the expected div idends forgone during the v esting period.\n\nStock-based  compensation  expense  is  predominantly  included  in  SG&amp;A  expenses  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  income.  Certain  stock-based compensation costs are capitalized or included in the cost of merchandise. See Note 7 for additional information.",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for investments measured at fair value.\n\n- U.S. and Foreign Government Securities : U.S. and foreign government securities consist of investments in Treasury Nominal Bonds and Inflation Protected Securities, agency bonds and municipal securities. Government securities are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information, such as broker quotes. Matrix pricing, yield curves and indices are used when broker quotes are not available.\n- Corporate Debt Instruments : Corporate debt instruments are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information, such as broker quotes. Matrix pricing, yield curves and indices are used when broker quotes are not available.\n- Common Stock : Common stocks are valued based on the price of the security as listed on an open active exchange on last trade date.\n- Asset Backed Securities : Asset backed securities are fix ed income securities such as mortgage backed securities and auto loans that are collateralized by pools of underlying assets that are unable to be sold individually. They are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information or a broker quote in a non-active over-the-counter market.\n- Collective Investment Funds : Collective investment funds consist of funds that are intended to mirror indices such as Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index and MSCI EAFE Index. They are valued on the basis of the relative interest of each participating investor in the fair value of the underlying assets of each of the respective collective investment funds, which are valued based on the net asset value ('NAV'), and are provided by the investment account manager as a practical expedient to estimate fair value. These investments are not classified by level but are disclosed to permit reconciliation to the fair value of plan assets.\n\nCash Flows: We make contributions to our pension plans to the extent that the contributions are tax deductible and pay benefits that relate to plans for salaried employees that cannot be funded under IRS regulations. Currently, we anticipate making employer contributions to our pension and postretirement plans of up to approximately $30 million for each in 2025. However, the foregoing estimates of 2025 contributions to our pension and postretirement plans are subject to change as a result of changes in tax  and other benefit laws, changes in interest rates, as well as asset performance significantly above or below the assumed long-term rate of return for each respective plan.",

COST mentions that higher tariffs and inflationary pressures, such as increases in merchandise costs, may adversely affect its business and profit margins. MO specifically notes that additional environmental regulations could increase its compliance and manufacturing costs. One specific economic factor COST highlights is the impact of higher tariffs on merchandise, which could directly increase MO's production expenses if those costs are passed through the supply chain.

Additionally, trade-related actions in v arious countries, particularly China and the United States, hav e affected the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. T he impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to potential cost increases. Higher tariffs could adv ersely impact our results.\n\nPrices of certain commodities, including gasoline and consumable goods used in manufacturing and our warehouse retail operations, are historically volatile  and  are  subject  to  fluctuations  arising  from  changes  in  domestic  and  international  supply  and  demand,  inflationary  pressures,  labor  costs, competition, market speculation, gov ernment regulations, taxes and periodic delays in deliv ery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices and our ability and desire to pass them through to our members may affect our sales and profit margins. These factors could also increase our merchandise costs and selling, general and administrativ e expenses, and otherwise adv ersely affect our operations and financial results. General economic conditions can also be affected by ev ents like the outbreak of hostilities or acts of terrorism.\n\nInflationary factors such as increases in merchandise costs may adv ersely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to adjust prices to sufficiently offset the effect of cost increases without negativ ely impacting consumer demand.\n\nSuppliers may be unable to timely supply us with quality merchandise at competitive prices or may fail to adhere to our high standards, resulting in adverse effects on our business, merchandise inventories, sales, and profit margins.\n\nWe depend heavily on our ability to purchase quality merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitiv e prices. As the quantities we require continue to grow, we hav e no assurances of continued supply, appropriate pricing or access to new products, and any supplier has the ability to change the terms upon which they sell to us or discontinue selling to us.

These additional laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition by increasing our compliance and manufacturing costs and creating legal and reputational risk if we are unable to, or are perceived not to, satisfy such requirements.\n\n## Capital Markets and Financing Risks\n\n## Disruption and uncertainty in the credit and capital markets could materially adversely affect our business.\n\nAccess to the credit and capital markets is important for us to satisfy our liquidity and financing needs. We typically access the commercial paper market in the second quarter to help fund payments under the Master Settlement Agreement (the 'MSA'), tax obligations and shareholder dividends. Disruption and uncertainty in the credit or capital markets or high interest rates could negatively impact the availability or cost of capital and adversely affect our liquidity, cash flow, earnings and dividend rate. In addition, tighter credit markets could lead to business disruptions for our suppliers and service providers, which could, in turn, materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n## A downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely impact our borrowing costs and access to credit and capital markets, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition.\n\nRating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings are based on a number of factors, including our cash generating capability, levels of indebtedness, policies with respect to shareholder distributions, the impact of strategic transactions and our financial strength generally, as well as factors beyond our control, such as the state of the economy and our industry. Any downgrade or announcement that we are under review for a potential downgrade of our credit ratings, as occurred following our former investment in JUUL, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, could increase our future borrowing costs, impair our ability to access the credit and capital markets, including the commercial paper market, on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all or result in a reduction in our liquidity, requiring us to rely on more expensive types of financing. Any such outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.\n\n## Our performance relating to corporate responsibility matters and investor and stakeholder responses thereto may impact our reputation, ability to attract investors and the market value of our stock.\n\nThere has been a heightened focus from investors and other stakeholders on corporate responsibility, including with respect to environmental, social and governance matters. In response, there has been an increase in third-party providers of assessments and ratings to satisfy investor demand for measurement of corporate responsibility performance, and the criteria by which these third parties measure such performance may vary or change over time. Furthermore we have published reports concerning our goals, approach and progress with respect to a range of corporate responsibility focus areas. Investors may use these non-financial performance factors and reports to guide investment strategies, and investor and other stakeholder expectations of and responses to our policies, actions, goals and disclosures concerning corporate responsibility matters may evolve over time. Investors may choose not to invest in us if their policies prevent them from investing in tobacco companies and may base investment and other decisions on their view of our policies, actions, goals or disclosures with respect to corporate responsibility matters.\n\nThere is also increased focus, including by governmental and non-governmental organizations, investors, trade customers, consumers, our employees and others, on environmental, social and governance matters. Despite our efforts, any failure to achieve our corporate responsibility goals, including those aimed at reducing the harm associated with our companies' products and our underage tobacco prevention goals, could result in adverse publicity. Furthermore, if investors or other stakeholders view our corporate responsibility policies, actions, goals or disclosures as insufficient or otherwise unacceptable, we could incur negative publicity and litigation challenges. These outcomes could materially adversely affect our businesses and reputation and impair our ability to attract and retain investors, which could have a material negative impact on the market value of our stock.\n\n## Information Technology and Data Privacy Risks\n\n## The failure of our, or our service providers', key suppliers' or trade customers', information systems to function as intended, or cyber-attacks or security breaches, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\nWe rely extensively on information technology, much of which is managed by third-party service providers (such as cloud data service providers), to support a variety of business processes and activities, including: complying with regulatory, legal, financial reporting and tax  requirements; engaging in marketing and ecommerce activities; managing and improving the effectiveness of our operations; researching, developing, manufacturing and distributing our products; collecting and storing sensitive data and confidential information; and communicating with employees, investors, suppliers, trade customers, adult tobacco consumers and others. Our suppliers, supply chain service providers and trade customers also rely extensively on information systems. We are also increasing the frequency and scale of new technology and systems deployment both directly and through third parties.\n\nWe continue to make appropriate investments in administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect our information systems and data from cyber-threats, including human error and malicious acts. Our safeguards include employee training, testing and auditing",

Costco's 10-K filing highlights that rising manufacturing costs, driven by inflationary pressures such as merchandise cost increases, supply chain volatility, and supplier constraints, may adversely affect businesses in the Consumer Staples sector.

Specifically, at the end of 2024, Costco operated 276 warehouses outside the U.S., increasing exposure to adverse tax consequences. Meanwhile, Altria experiences financial pressure from illicit trade in tobacco products, which undermines tax collection and leads to potential regulatory backlash, including increased excise taxes.

These factors include (i) receipt of regulatory authorizations, (ii) prevailing economic, market, regulatory or business conditions, or changes in such conditions, negatively affecting the parties or their plans for future collaboration and partnerships, (iii) changes in market or other conditions resulting in unanticipated delays in the design and development of future products or the commencement of test launches, (iv) the outcome of any legal proceedings or investigations that may be instituted against the parties or others related to the joint venture, (v) changes in the preferences of U.S. adult tobacco consumers, (vi) the failure to meet commercialization milestones and (vii) the ability of the parties to enter into future partnerships on terms acceptable to both parties and in the ex pected manner or timeframe, if at all. Such factors could have a negative effect on our ability to generate new revenue streams and enter new geographic markets.\n\nLengthy and unpredictable regulatory review periods complicate efforts to strategize and plan with respect to commercialization of new products, and we cannot predict or influence the speed with which the FDA reviews PMTAs. For example, a protracted FDA review of one of our operating companies' PMTAs would allow competitive products already on the market to establish market share, brand recognition and adult tobacco consumer loyalty in the absence of competition from our product. If we do not succeed in commercializing innovative tobacco products that appeal to adult tobacco consumers or we fail to obtain or maintain regulatory authorization for the marketing or sale of these products, including with claims of reduced health risks, we could be at a competitive disadvantage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\nOur inability to successfully counter the effects of illicit trade in tobacco products, including e-v apor products, could hav e a material adv erse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position and our ability to achiev e our Vision.\n\nIllicit trade in tobacco products has had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our business, including the sales volumes and market shares of our operating companies' innovative and smoke-free products and traditional tobacco products. Illicit trade can take many forms, including the sale of counterfeit tobacco products; the sale of tobacco products that do not comply with the FSPTCA and FDA regulations; the sale of tobacco products in the United States that are intended for sale outside the country; the sale of untax ed tobacco products over the Internet and by other means designed to avoid the collection of applicable taxes; and the diversion into one taxing jurisdiction of tobacco products intended for sale in another jurisdiction. Counterfeit versions of our operating companies' products can negatively affect adult tobacco consumer experiences with and opinions of those brands as well as other stakeholders' perceptions and opinions of our companies and brands. Illicit trade in tobacco products also harms law-abiding wholesalers and retailers by depriving them of lawful sales and undermines the significant investment we have made in legitimate distribution channels. Moreover, illicit trade in tobacco products results in federal, state and local governments losing tax revenues. Losses in tax revenues can cause such governments to take various actions, including increasing excise taxes, imposing legislative or regulatory requirements, or asserting claims against manufacturers of tobacco products or members of the trade channels through which such tobacco products are legally distributed and sold, each of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\nIn the e-vapor category, illicit flavored disposable product usage has significantly increased, and such products now comprise the majority of the e-vapor category. The impacts of this dynamic include declines in pod-based e-vapor product volume and increased cross-category movement among adult cigarette smokers that has contributed to higher than expected domestic cigarette industry volume declines. Recent enforcement actions by regulatory agencies have not had a material impact in curbing the proliferation and sale of illicit disposable e-vapor products. This dynamic has made the operating environment challenging for our businesses. We have increased engagement with the FDA and other government agencies to encourage enforcement action against these illicit products, but such enforcement has been inadequate to date. We also have taken legal action to protect our lawful e-vapor business, which exposes us to additional costs and expenses. Our failure to counter the impacts of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products and the FDA's failure to take meaningful enforcement actions against manufacturers and products that violate the law could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\nFailure to complete or manage strategic transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and investments in third parties, or realize the anticipated benefits of such transactions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\nWe regularly evaluate potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and investments in third parties.

      "answer": "Costco evaluates the realizability of deferred tax assets based on the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions and only recognizes benefits when there's a more-likely-than-not chance of withstanding tax authority challenges. Altria, on the other hand, recognizes uncertain tax benefits only when it's more likely than not they'll be sustained upon examination, and measures them as the largest amount with over 50% likelihood of realization. Both companies apply judgment in their tax reporting, but differences in their industries and tax environments lead to distinct approaches in recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities, influencing their financial statements differently.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nThe  Company accounts for  income  taxes  using  the  asset  and  liability  method.  Deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are  recognized  for  the  future  tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases, credits and loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be recov ered or settled. T he effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A v aluation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized.\n\nThe timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions requires significant judgment.  The benefits  of  uncertain  tax  positions  are  recorded  in  the  Company's  consolidated  financial  statements  only  after  determining  a  more-likely-than-not probability  that  the  uncertain  tax  positions  will  withstand  challenge  from  tax  authorities.  When  facts  and  circumstances  change,  the  Company reassesses these probabilities and records changes as appropriate.\n\n## Net Income per Common Share Attributable to Costco\n\nThe computation of basic net income per share uses the weighted av erage number of shares that were outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted net income per share uses the weighted av erage number of shares in the basic net income per share calculation plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming v esting of all potentially dilutiv e common shares outstanding using the treasury stock method for shares subject to RSUs.\n\n## Stock Repurchase Programs\n\nRepurchased shares of common stock are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. The par v alue of repurchased shares is deducted  from  common  stock  and  the  excess  repurchase  price  ov er  par  v alue  is  deducted  by  allocation  to  additional  paid-in  capital  and  retained earnings. The amount allocated to additional paid-in capital is the current v alue of additional paid-in capital per share outstanding and is applied to the number of shares repurchased. Any remaining amount is allocated to retained earnings. See Note 6 for additional information.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\n\nIn  Nov ember  2023,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (FASB)  issued  Accounting  Standards  Update  (ASU)  2023-07,  which  is  intended  to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily about significant segment expenses. The standard is effectiv e for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectiv ely to all prior periods presented in the financial statements.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, which focuses on income tax disclosures by requiring public business entities, on an annual basis, to  disclose  specific  categories  in  the  rate  reconciliation,  prov ide  information  for  reconciling  items  that  meet  a  quantitativ e  threshold,  and  certain information about income taxes paid. The standard is effectiv e for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied on a prospectiv e basis. Retrospectiv e application is permitted.\n\nThe Company is evaluating both standards.",

PM USA's obligations under the State Settlement Agreements to make quarterly payments with respect to settling plaintiffs' attorneys' fees ended in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. Payments under the State Settlement Agreements and the FDA user fees are based on variable factors, such as volume, operating income, market share and inflation, depending on the subject payment. Our subsidiaries account for the cost of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees as a component of cost of sales. Our subsidiaries recorded approximately $3.7 billion and $4.0 billion of charges to cost of sales for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees.\n\nWe record provisions in our consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. At the present time, while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, except to the extent discussed in Note 20 and Item 3: (i) management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any pending litigation; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in any pending case; and (iii) accordingly, management has not provided any amounts in our consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes, if any. We expense litigation defense costs as incurred and include such costs in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statements of earnings.\n\n- Employee Benefit Plans: We provide a range of benefits to certain employees and retired employees, including pension, postretirement health care and postemployment benefits. We record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by GAAP, which include various actuarial assumptions as to discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets, mortality, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so. Any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods.\n\nWe recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheets and record as a component of other comprehensive earnings (losses), net of deferred income taxes, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost (income). We subsequently amortize the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits recorded as components of other comprehensive earnings (losses) into net periodic benefit cost (income) in future years.\n\nDue to changes in market factors, our discount rates used to determine our pension plan and postretirement plan obligations increased to 5.7% at December 31, 2024 from 5.3% and 5.2%, respectively, for these plans at December 31, 2023. We presently anticipate net pre-tax pension and postretirement income of approximately $15 million in 2025 versus net pre-tax  income of $46 million in 2024. This decrease is due primarily to lower ex pected income on plan assets and higher amortization of net unrecognized losses in 2025, partially offset by lower service and interest costs. Assuming no change to the shape of the yield curve, a 50 basis point decrease (increase) in our discount rates would increase (decrease) our pension and postretirement expense by approximately $10 million. Similarly, a 50 basis point decrease (increase) in the ex pected return on plan assets would increase (decrease) our pension and postretirement expense by approximately $40 million.\n\nFor additional information see Note 18. Benefit Plans to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 ('Note 18').\n\n- Income Taxes: Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. We determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the financial statement and tax  bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax  rates in effect for the year in which the differences are ex pected to reverse. We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax  asset will not be realized. We determine the realizability of deferred tax  assets based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence. In reaching this determination, we consider the character of the assets and the possible sources of taxable income of the appropriate character within the available carryback and carryforward periods available under the tax law.\n\nWe recognize the financial statement benefit for uncertain income tax positions in our consolidated financial statements when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon ex amination by tax ing authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For those income tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax  benefit will not be sustained, no tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements. We recognize accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of earnings.\n\nWe recognized income tax benefits and charges in the consolidated statements of earnings during 2024 and 2023 as a result of various tax events.\n\nFor additional information on income taxes, see Note 16. Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 ('Note 16').",

For further discussion on goodwill, see Note 4. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 ('Note 4').\n\nIn 2021, Altria elected to perform a qualitative assessment for certain of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. This qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entity-specific qualitative factors to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units were below carrying value. For certain of its other reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets, Altria elected to unconditionally bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a single step quantitative assessment. Altria used an income approach to estimate the fair values of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The income approach reflects the discounting of expected future cash flows to their present value at a rate of return that incorporates the risk-free rate for the use of those funds, the expected rate of inflation and the risks associated with realizing expected future cash flows. The weighted-average discount rate used in performing the valuations was approximately 10%.\n\nIn performing the 2021 discounted cash flow analysis, Altria made various judgments, estimates and assumptions, the most significant of which were volume, income, growth rates and discount rates. The analysis incorporated assumptions used in Altria's long-term financial forecast, which is used by Altria's management to evaluate business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to setting employee compensation targets. The assumptions incorporated the highest and best use of Altria's indefinite-lived intangible assets and also included perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term financial forecast. The perpetual growth rate used in performing all of the valuations was 2%. Fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions, some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of Altria's control.\n\nAlthough Altria's discounted cash flow analysis is based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information at the time that the discounted cash flow analysis is developed, there is significant judgment used in determining future cash flows. The following factors have the most potential to impact expected future cash flows and, therefore, Altria's impairment conclusions: general economic conditions (such as continued uncertainty from the COVID-19 pandemic); federal, state and local regulatory developments; category growth rates; consumer preferences; success of planned new product expansions; competitive activity; and income and excise taxes. For further discussion of these factors, see Operating Results by Business Segment - Tobacco Space - Business Environment below.\n\nWhile Altria's management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset at December 31, 2021 are reasonable, actual performance in the short-term or long-term could be significantly different from forecasted performance, which could result in impairment charges in future periods.\n\nFor further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, see Note 4.\n\n- Investments in Equity Securities: Altria reviews its equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting (ABI and Cronos) for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of its investments to their carrying value. If the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary, the investment is considered impaired and reduced to fair value, and the impairment is recognized in the period identified. The factors used to make this determination include the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, and Altria's intent and ability to hold its investment until recovery.\n\nFollowing Share Conversion (as defined in Note 6) in the fourth quarter of 2020, Altria elected to account for its equity investment in JUUL under the fair value option. Under this option, any cash dividends received and any changes in the fair value of the equity investment in JUUL, which is calculated quarterly using level 3 fair value measurements, are included in (income) losses from equity investments in the consolidated statements of earnings (losses).",

We complement these recruiting efforts with hiring experienced employees with demonstrated leadership capabilities.\n\nTo help our employees succeed in their roles and develop in their careers, we emphasize ongoing training and leadership development opportunities. Building skills that drive innovation and aligning our employees to our Vision is important for our long-term success. The Human Resources department leads our learning and development efforts partnering with learning professionals embedded in functions throughout our operating and services companies. Employees have access to a wide variety of development programs, including new employee onboarding, classroom and self-guided training programs, technical training, including training to maintain professional certifications, and our educational refund program for continuing education.\n\nWe regularly conduct anonymous employee engagement surveys to seek feedback on a variety of topics, including employee satisfaction, support from leadership, corporate culture and culture of compliance. In addition, in 2021, we conducted quarterly employee surveys to gauge topics such as employee well-being in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, inclusion and workload. Survey results, including comparisons to prior results, are shared with our employees and our Board and are used to modify or enhance our human capital management programs.\n\n## Workplace Safety\n\nOur goal is for every Altria employee to have an injury-free career, which is supported by our Safety Management System ('SMS'). We strive for continuous improvement in our employee safety program through SMS infrastructure. Our Occupational Safety and Health Administration recordable injury rate for 2021 was 1.7% (versus 1.9% for 2020) and remains below the benchmark for companies in the U.S. Beverage and Tobacco Product Manufacturing industry classification.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented safety measures aligned with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines to help protect our employees, including remote work for non-manufacturing salaried employees and additional cleaning and sanitation practices. We also established a COVID-19 Task Force and a Return to Workplace team to facilitate the decision-making process as we navigated the evolving COVID-19 environment and its impacts on our employees.\n\n## Number of Employees and Labor Relations\n\nAt December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 6,000 people (a decrease from approximately 7,100 at December 31, 2020 driven by the sale of the wine business). Thirty percent of our employees were hourly manufacturing employees and members of labor unions subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe we engage and collaborate effectively with our hourly employees, as demonstrated by the positive working relationship between our companies and the unions. We also have long-term agreements that resolve any collective bargaining dispute through binding arbitration, which further demonstrates the trust-based relationship with the unions.\n\n## Supply Chain Human Capital Matters\n\nWe support efforts to address human capital concerns in the tobacco supply chain. For example, in our domestic tobacco supply chain, we use on-farm good agricultural practices assessments to assess growers' compliance with practices related to labor management. Our tobacco companies also establish contract terms and conditions with tobacco growers addressing child and forced labor and conduct social compliance audits in high-risk tobacco growing regions.\n\nMore information about efforts discussed in this section can be found in our Corporate Responsibility Reports at www.altria.com/responsibility.\n\n- Intellectual Property: Trademarks are of material importance to Altria and its operating companies, and are protected by registration or otherwise. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, the portfolio of United States patents owned by Altria's businesses, as a whole, was material to Altria and its tobacco businesses. However, no one patent or group of related patents was material to Altria's business or its tobacco businesses as of December 31, 2021. Altria's businesses also have proprietary trade secrets, technology, knowhow, processes and other intellectual property rights that are protected by appropriate confidentiality measures. Certain trade secrets are material to Altria and its tobacco businesses.\n- Government Regulations: Altria and its subsidiaries are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations. For discussion of laws and regulations impacting Altria's tobacco operating companies, see Tobacco Space - Business Environment in Item 7.\n\nAltria and its subsidiaries (and former subsidiaries) are also subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise related to environmental protection, including, in the United States: the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known as 'Superfund'), which can impose joint and several liability on each responsible party. Subsidiaries (and former subsidiaries) of Altria are involved in several matters subjecting them to potential costs of remediation",

      "answer": "COST manages a global workforce of 304,000 employees and emphasizes that compensation and benefits are its largest expense after merchandise costs. Altria (MO), on the other hand, targets its total compensation packages to be between the 50th and 75th percentiles of peer companies to attract and retain talent, especially in light of declining social acceptance of tobacco. MO's compensation strategy includes a focus on pay equity, with female employees earning 99.6% of male employees' salaries and non-white employees earning 99.9% of white employees' salaries. The combined percentage of female and non-white employees' salaries relative to male and white employees at MO is 199.5% (99.6% + 99.9%).",

Segment Reporting to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 ('Note 15').\n- Executive Officers of Altria: The disclosure regarding executive officers is included in Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance Information about Our Executive Officers as of February 15, 2022 of this Form 10-K.\n- Human Capital Resources: We believe our workforce is critical to achieving our Vision. Attracting, developing and retaining the best talent with the skills to make significant progress toward our Vision is a key business priority. Moreover, we recognize the importance of doing business the right way. We believe culture influences employee actions and decision-making. This is why we dedicate resources to promoting a vibrant, inclusive workplace; attracting, developing and retaining talented, diverse employees; promoting a culture of compliance and integrity; creating a safe workplace; and rewarding and recognizing employees for both the results they deliver and, importantly, how they deliver them.\n\n## Oversight and Management\n\nOur Human Resources department is responsible for managing employment-related matters, including recruiting and hiring, onboarding, compensation and benefits design and implementation, performance management, advancement and succession planning and professional and learning development. Our inclusion, diversity and equity ('ID&amp;E') programs are managed by our Corporate Citizenship department. Our Board of Directors ('Board of Directors' or 'Board') and the Compensation and Talent Development Committee provide oversight of human capital matters, including reviewing initiatives and programs related to corporate culture and enterprise-wide talent development, including our ID&amp;E initiatives.\n\n## Inclusion, Diversity and Equity\n\nWe recognize the critical importance of ID&amp;E in pursuing our Vision and believe in the value of a workforce composed of a broad spectrum of backgrounds and cultures. In 2020, we established the following aspirational Inclusion &amp; Diversity Aiming Points to help guide our efforts:\n\n- Be an inclusive place to work for all employees, regardless of level, demographic group or work function.\n- Have equal numbers of men and women among our vice president and director-level employees.\n- Increase our vice president and director-level employees who are Asian, Black, Hispanic or two or more races to at least 30%.\n- Increase our vice president and director-level employees who are LGBTQ+, a person with a disability or a veteran.\n- Have diverse functional leadership teams that reflect the organizations they lead.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, women represented 32% of vice president-level and 41% of director-level roles; Asian, Black, Hispanic or employees of two or more races represented 24% of our vice president-level and 26% of our director-level roles.\n\n## Compensation and Benefits\n\nOur compensation and benefits programs are designed to help us attract, retain and motivate strong talent. However, we recognize that the decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage may impact our ability to attract and retain talent. We work to manage this risk by, among other things, targeting total compensation packages to be above peer companies for which we compete for talent. Depending on employee level, total compensation includes different elements - base salary, annual cash incentives, long-term equity and cash incentives and benefits. Our goal is to provide total compensation packages between the 50th and 75th percentiles of total compensation packages paid to employees in comparable positions at our peer companies upon attainment of business and individual goals.\n\nWe are committed to pay equity across our companies. Based on the most recent annual analysis we conducted in November 2021, adjusting for factors generally considered to be legitimate differentiators of salary, such as performance and tenure, salaries of our female employees were 99.6% of those of our male employees, and salaries of our non-white employees were 99.9% of those of our white employees.\n\nIn addition to cash and equity compensation, we offer generous employee benefits such as significant company contributions to deferred profit sharing plans, consumer-driven health plan coverage, vacation and holiday pay, disability and life insurance, and up to 12 weeks paid parental and family leave for birth, adoption and foster placement and an additional six weeks paid leave for birth mothers. Our benefits also include mental health and wellness benefits and family creation assistance benefits, such as adoption assistance and coverage for fertility treatments. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, for 2020 and 2021, we expanded dependent care coverage to include $5,000 employee reimbursement for remote learning and other dependent care costs. In addition, we offered financial incentives to our employees to encourage vaccination against COVID-19. While there is some variability in employee benefits across our companies, the examples we provide are available to most employees.\n\nWe are also committed to investing in the educational development of our workforce through an unlimited tuition refund program for job-related courses or company-related degrees.",

Altria's subsidiaries expect to continue to make capital and other expenditures in connection with environmental laws and regulations. As discussed in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 ('Note 2'), Altria provides for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations on an undiscounted basis when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Such accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change. Other than those amounts, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the cost of any environmental remediation and compliance efforts that subsidiaries of Altria may undertake in the future. In the opinion of management, however, compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including the payment of any remediation costs or damages and related expenditures, has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on Altria's consolidated results of operations, capital expenditures, financial position or cash flows.\n\n## Available Information\n\nAltria is required to file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC').\n\nAltria makes available free of charge on or through its website (www.altria.com) its Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 'Exchange Act'), as soon as reasonably practicable after Altria electronically files such material with, or furnishes it to, the SEC. Investors can access Altria's filings with the SEC by visiting www.altria.com/secfilings.\n\nThe information on the respective websites of Altria and its subsidiaries is not, and shall not be deemed to be, a part of this Form 10-K or incorporated into any other filings Altria makes with the SEC.\n\n## Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nThe following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, our results of operations, our cash flows, our financial position and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Form 10K.\n\nWe may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including earnings guidance and other statements contained in filings with the SEC, reports to security holders, press releases and investor webcasts and presentations. You can identify these forward-looking statements by use of words such as 'strategy,' 'expects,' 'continues,' 'plans,' 'anticipates,' 'believes,' 'will,' 'estimates,' 'forecasts,' 'intends,' 'projects,' 'goals,' 'objectives,' 'guidance,' 'targets' and other words of similar meaning. You can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.\n\nWe cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans, estimates and assumptions. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying estimates or assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. You should bear this in mind as you consider forward-looking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in Altria's securities. In connection with the 'safe harbor' provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we are identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in, or implied by, any forward-looking statements made by us; any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements. We elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this Form 10-K particularly in the 'Business Environment' sections preceding our discussion of the operating results of our subsidiaries' businesses below in Item 7. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that we may make from time to time except as required by applicable law.\n\n## Risks Related to Litigation, Legislative or Regulatory Action\n\nUnfavorable litigation outcomes could materially adversely affect the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries or investees and Altria's ability to achieve its Vision.\n\nLegal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various United States and foreign jurisdictions against Altria and its subsidiaries, including PM USA, as well as their respective indemnitees, indemnitors and Altria's investees. Various types of claims may be raised in these proceedings, including product liability, unfair trade practices, antitrust, tax, contraband-related claims, patent infringement, employment matters, claims alleging violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ('RICO'), claims for contribution and claims of competitors, shareholders and distributors. Legislative action, such as changes to tort law, also may expand the types of claims and remedies available to plaintiffs.\n\nLitigation is subject to uncertainty and it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending or future cases. An unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco-related or other litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation. Damages claimed in some tobacco-related or other litigation are significant and, in certain cases, have ranged in the billions",

      "answer": "Altria's forward-looking valuation of its JUUL investment heavily depends on projected sales volumes, which are subject to significant uncertainty due to regulatory, legal, and market risks. A deviation in these sales volume assumptions could materially impact the valuation of the investment. Similarly, Costco emphasizes net sales growth as a key forward-looking metric, with its business model relying on high sales volumes to maintain low margins and efficient operations. If Altria's JUUL-related sales volume risks spill over into broader consumer staples trends (e.g., reduced consumer spending due to regulatory actions on vaping products), Costco could see a dampened net sales growth, especially if this affects customer shopping frequency or product demand.",

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law.\n\n## PART I\n\n## Item 1-Business\n\nCostco  Wholesale  Corporation  and  its  subsidiaries  (Costco  or  the  Company)  began  operations  in  1983,  in  Seattle, Washington. We are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the United States (U.S.) and Puerto  Rico,  Canada,  Mexico,  Japan,  United  Kingdom  (U.K.),  Korea,  Taiwan, Australia,  Spain,  France,  China,  and Iceland.  Costco  operated  838,  815,  and  795  warehouses  worldwide  at  August  28,  2022,  August  29,  2021,  and August 30, 2020, respectively. The Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Korea, Taiwan,  Japan,  and Australia.  Our  common  stock  trades  on  the  NASDAQ  Global  Select  Market,  under  the  symbol 'COST.'\n\nWe report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first three quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). The material seasonal impact in our operations is increased net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. References to 2022, 2021, and 2020 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 28, 2022, August 29, 2021, and August 30, 2020, respectively.\n\n## General\n\nWe operate membership warehouses and e-commerce websites based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing,  efficient  distribution  and  reduced  handling  of  merchandise  in  no-frills,  self-service  warehouse  facilities, these  volumes  and  turnover  enable  us  to  operate  profitably  at  significantly  lower  gross  margins  (net  sales  less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We often sell inventory before we are required to pay for it, even while taking advantage of early payment discounts.\n\nWe  buy  most  of  our  merchandise  directly  from  manufacturers  and  route  it  to  cross-docking  consolidation  points (depots) or directly to our warehouses. Our depots receive large shipments from manufacturers and quickly ship these goods to warehouses. This process creates freight volume and handling efficiencies, lowering costs associated with traditional  multiple-step  distribution  channels.  For  our  e-commerce  operations  we  ship  merchandise  through  our depots, our logistics operations for big and bulky items, as well as through drop-ship and other delivery arrangements with our suppliers.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Investment in JUUL\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the estimated fair value of Altria's investment in JUUL was $1.7 billion, unchanged from December 31, 2020, as Altria's projections of lower JUUL revenues in the United States over time due to lower JUUL volume assumptions were offset by (i) the effect of passage of time on the projected cash flows and (ii) a decrease in the discount rate due to change in market factors.\n\nAltria uses an income approach to estimate the fair value of its investment in JUUL. The income approach reflects the discounting of future cash flows for the United States and international markets at a rate of return that incorporates the risk-free rate for the use of those funds, the expected rate of inflation and the risks associated with realizing future cash flows. Future cash flows are based on a range of scenarios that consider various potential regulatory and market outcomes.\n\nIn determining the fair value of its investment in JUUL in 2021, Altria made various judgments, estimates and assumptions, the most significant of which were sales volume, operating margins, discount rates and perpetual growth rates. All significant inputs used in the valuation are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The discount rates used in performing the valuations ranged from 17.0% to 19.0% at December 31, 2021. The perpetual growth rates used in performing each valuation ranged from (0.5%) to 0.0%. Additionally in determining these significant assumptions, Altria made judgments regarding the: (i) likelihood and extent of various potential regulatory actions and the continued adverse public perception impacting the e-vapor category and specifically JUUL; (ii) risk created by the number and types of legal cases pending against JUUL; (iii) expectations for the future state of the e-vapor category including competitive dynamics; and (iv) timing of international expansion plans.\n\nAlthough Altria's discounted cash flow analyses were based on assumptions that Altria's management considered reasonable and were based on the best available information at the time that the analyses were developed, there is significant judgment used in determining future cash flows. If the following factors, in isolation, significantly deviate from current expectations, Altria believes that they have the potential to materially impact Altria's significant assumptions of sales volume, operating margins, discount rate, and perpetual growth rate, thus potentially materially decreasing Altria's valuation of its investment in JUUL:\n\n- adverse developments related to litigation;\n- a successful challenge by the FTC in its administrative complaint against Altria and JUUL, for a further discussion, see Item 3 and Note 18;\n- a substantial increase in state and federal e-vapor excise taxes;\n- adverse publicity due to underage use of e-vapor products and other factors;\n- supply chain constraints and component part shortages, if not transitory;\n- unanticipated adverse impacts on JUUL's relationships with employees, customers, suppliers and other third parties;\n- unfavorable financial and market performance, including substantial changes in competitive dynamics;\n- delay in timing of international expansion plans;\n- disruption in JUUL's current and future plans or operations in domestic and international markets; and\n- unfavorable regulatory and legislative developments at the international, federal, state and local levels such as the potential removal of certain e-vapor products from the market as a result of FDA enforcement action or the potential denial of new tobacco product applications for e-vapor products.\n\nIf the following factors, in isolation, significantly deviate from current expectations, Altria believes that they have the potential to materially impact Altria's significant assumptions of sales volume, operating margins, discount rate, and perpetual growth rate, thus potentially materially increasing Altria's valuation of its investment in JUUL:\n\n- favorable developments related to litigation;\n- favorable financial and market performance, including substantial changes in competitive dynamics;\n- improvement of public perception around JUUL and the e-vapor category; and\n- favorable regulatory and legislative developments at the international, federal, state and local levels such as FDA authorization of future tobacco product applications for JUUL flavored e-vapor products, which are currently not permitted in the market without authorization.\n\nWhile Altria's management believes that the recorded value of its investment in JUUL at December 31, 2021 represents its best estimate of the fair value of the investment, JUUL's actual performance in the short term or long term could be significantly different from forecasted performance due to changes in the factors noted above. Additionally, the value of Altria's investment in JUUL could be significantly impacted by changes in the discount rate, which could be caused by numerous factors, including changes in market inputs, as well as risks specific to JUUL and its litigation environment.\n\n## Investment in Cronos\n\nThe fair value of Altria's equity method investment in Cronos is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for Cronos's common shares and was classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

The Company records provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when management determines that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company's most significant category of legal proceedings is tobacco and health litigation. The Company's accrued liability for tobacco and health litigation was $1 million as of December 31, 2021. While it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, except for those cases which have been accrued for: (i) management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobacco and health related cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in any of the pending tobacco and health related cases; and (iii) accordingly, management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes, if any.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to tobacco and health litigation provisions and disclosures is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when determining if a loss for tobacco and health litigation should be recorded in the consolidated financial statements, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management's determination of whether a loss should be recorded; and (ii) the significant judgment by management when disclosing facts and circumstances related to the litigation, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures related to the disclosures, including evaluating the audit evidence obtained related to management's disclosures.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's loss determination for tobacco and health litigation matters and controls over the related financial statement disclosures. These procedures also included, among others, (i) evaluating the completeness of the Company's description of tobacco and health litigation matters; (ii) confirming with external and internal legal counsel the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the extent to which a loss is estimable; (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of management's determination regarding the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome; and (iv) evaluating the sufficiency of the Company's tobacco and health litigation disclosures.\n\n## JUUL Labs, Inc. ('JUUL') - Determination of the Fair Value of the Investment\n\nAs described in Notes 1, 2, and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, as of December 31, 2021, the Company accounts for its equity method investment in JUUL under the fair value option. The Company's investment in JUUL was $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2021. Fair value is estimated by management using an income approach, which reflects the discounting of future cash flows for the U.S. and international markets of JUUL's business. In determining the fair value of the Company's investment in JUUL, management has made various judgments, estimates and assumptions, the most significant of which were sales volume, operating margins, discount rates and perpetual growth rates. All significant inputs used in the valuation are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Additionally, management has made judgments regarding the: (i) likelihood and extent of various potential regulatory actions and the continued adverse public perception impacting the e-vapor category and specifically JUUL, (ii) risk created by the number and types of legal cases pending against JUUL, (iii) expectations for the future state of the e-vapor category including competitive dynamics and (iv) timing of international expansion plans.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the determination of the fair value of the investment in JUUL is a critical audit matter are the (i) significant judgment by management when determining the fair value of the investment in JUUL; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures to evaluate management's assessment of the risk created by the number and types of legal cases pending against JUUL, the timing of international expansion plans, the reasonableness of the range of scenarios that consider various potential regulatory and market outcomes and evaluating management's significant assumptions related to sales volume, operating margins, and discount rates; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's determination of the fair value of the investment in JUUL, including controls over the significant judgments and assumptions related to sales volume, operating margins, discount rates, the risk created by the number and types of legal cases pending against JUUL and timing of international expansion plans. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management's process for determining the fair value estimate; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the income approach; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the income approach; (iv) evaluating management's assessment of the risk created by the number and types of legal cases pending against JUUL; (v) evaluating the reasonableness of the range of scenarios that consider various potential regulatory and market outcomes; (vi) evaluating the reasonableness of the timing of international expansion plans; and (vii) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to sales volume, operating margins, and discount rates.",

      "answer": "In 2019, Altria recorded a $4.5 billion impairment charge for its investment in JUUL due to lower e-vapor sales volume assumptions in the U.S. and international markets. In 2020, Altria recorded an additional $2.6 billion impairment charge, driven by projections of lower JUUL revenues over time due to lower pricing assumptions and delays in achieving operating margin performance, which were tied to revised international expansion plans and evolving U.S. e-vapor dynamics. This shows that declining sales volume assumptions had a direct negative financial impact on Altria\u2019s investment valuation. In contrast, Costco's business model relies heavily on high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover to operate profitably at lower gross margins, demonstrating that sales volume is a critical driver of positive financial performance for Costco, while its decline led to significant financial losses for Altria through impairment charges.",

In contrast, Costco's business thrives on strong sales volume, showing that the same metric (sales volume) had opposite financial implications for the two companies due to their differing business models."

References to 2022, 2021, and 2020 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 28, 2022, August 29, 2021, and August 30, 2020, respectively.\n\n## General\n\nWe operate membership warehouses and e-commerce websites based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing,  efficient  distribution  and  reduced  handling  of  merchandise  in  no-frills,  self-service  warehouse  facilities, these  volumes  and  turnover  enable  us  to  operate  profitably  at  significantly  lower  gross  margins  (net  sales  less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We often sell inventory before we are required to pay for it, even while taking advantage of early payment discounts.\n\nWe  buy  most  of  our  merchandise  directly  from  manufacturers  and  route  it  to  cross-docking  consolidation  points (depots) or directly to our warehouses. Our depots receive large shipments from manufacturers and quickly ship these goods to warehouses. This process creates freight volume and handling efficiencies, lowering costs associated with traditional  multiple-step  distribution  channels.  For  our  e-commerce  operations  we  ship  merchandise  through  our depots, our logistics operations for big and bulky items, as well as through drop-ship and other delivery arrangements with our suppliers.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## 2020 Financial Activity\n\n- Altria recorded a non-cash pre-tax unrealized gain of $100 million for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of an increase in the estimated fair value of its investment in JUUL. The increase in fair value was primarily driven by the effect of passage of time on the projected cash flows, as there were no material changes in the significant assumptions.\n- In September 2020, JUUL announced a strategic update, which included its plans for a significant global workforce reduction, its evaluation of its resource allocation and the possibility of exiting various international markets. As part of the preparation of Altria's financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2020, Altria performed a qualitative assessment of impairment indicators for its investment in JUUL and determined that JUUL's strategic update was an indicator of impairment at September 30, 2020, given the significant deterioration in JUUL's business prospects.\n- Given the existence of this impairment indicator, Altria performed a quantitative valuation of its investment in JUUL during the third quarter of 2020 and recorded a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge of $2.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, reported as impairment of JUUL equity securities in its consolidated statements of earnings (losses). The impairment charge was driven by Altria's projections of lower JUUL revenues over time due to lower pricing assumptions and delays in JUUL achieving previously forecasted operating margin performance. These drivers were the result of (i) JUUL's revised international expansion plans and (ii) the evolving U.S. e-vapor category and associated competitive dynamics.\n\n## 2019 Financial Activity\n\n- In 2019, Altria recorded total non-cash pre-tax impairment charges of $8.6 billion ($4.5 billion in the third quarter of 2019 and $4.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019) related to its investment in JUUL resulting in a $4.2 billion carrying value of its investment in JUUL at December 31, 2019.\n- In the third quarter of 2019, Altria performed a qualitative assessment for impairment indicators and concluded that impairment indicators existed. These indicators included significant adverse changes in both the e-vapor regulatory environment and the industry in which JUUL operates. While there was no single determinative event or factor, Altria considered in totality the following indicators of impairment: the increased likelihood of a United States Food and Drug Administration ('FDA') compliance policy prohibiting the sale of certain flavored e-vapor products in the U.S. market without a pre-market authorization; various e-vapor bans put in place by certain states and cities in the U.S. and in certain international markets, coupled with the increased potential for additional bans in the future; and the impact of heightened adverse publicity, including news reports and public health advisories concerning vapingrelated lung injuries and deaths. Altria determined that the third-quarter 2019 impairment charge was due primarily to lower e-vapor sales volume assumptions in the U.S. and international markets and a delay in achieving operating margin performance as compared to the assumptions at the time of the JUUL Transaction, which resulted in a noncash pre-tax impairment charge of $4.5 billion.\n- In the fourth quarter of 2019, Altria determined that a significant increase in the number of legal cases pending against JUUL in the fourth quarter of 2019, which included a variety of class action lawsuits and personal injury claims, as well as cases brought by state attorneys general and local governments, resulted in an additional indicator of impairment. Altria determined that the fourth-quarter 2019 impairment charge resulted substantially from increased discount rates applied to future cash flow projections, due to the significant risk created by the increase in the number of legal cases pending against JUUL and the expectation that the number of legal cases against JUUL will continue to increase, which resulted in an additional non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $4.1 billion.\n\nAltria uses an income approach to estimate the fair value of its investment in JUUL. The income approach reflects the discounting of future cash flows for the U.S. and international markets at a rate of return that incorporates the risk-free rate for the use of those funds, the expected rate of inflation and the risks associated with realizing future cash flows. Future cash flows were based on a range of scenarios that consider various potential regulatory and market outcomes.\n\nIn determining the estimated fair value of its investment in JUUL, in 2021, 2020 and 2019, Altria made various judgments, estimates and assumptions, the most significant of which were sales volume, operating margins, discount rates and perpetual growth rates. All significant inputs used in the valuation are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Additionally, in determining these significant assumptions, Altria made judgments regarding the (i) likelihood and extent of various potential regulatory actions and the continued adverse public perception impacting the e-vapor category and specifically JUUL, (ii) risk created by the number and types of legal cases pending against JUUL, (iii) expectations for the future state of the e-vapor category including competitive dynamics and (iv) timing of international expansion plans.",

Michelle Transaction, which was used to partially fund the expansion of the January 2021 share repurchase program as discussed in Note 10. Capital Stock to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 ('Note 10').\n\nIn October 2020, Altria filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, under which Altria may offer debt securities or warrants to purchase debt securities from time to time over a three-year period from the date of filing.\n\n## Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Future Contractual Obligations\n\nAltria has no off-balance sheet arrangements, including special purpose entities, other than guarantees and contractual obligations that are discussed below.\n\nGuarantees and Other Similar Matters - As discussed in Note 18, Altria and certain of its subsidiaries had unused letters of credit obtained in the ordinary course of business and guarantees (including third-party guarantees) outstanding at December 31, 2021. From time to time, subsidiaries of Altria also issue lines of credit to affiliated entities. In addition, as discussed below in Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information and in Note 9, PM USA has issued guarantees relating to Altria's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under the Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program. These items have not had, and are not expected to have, a significant impact on Altria's liquidity.\n\nLong-Term Debt and Interest on Borrowings - In addition to maturities of long-term debt, Altria makes interest payments based on stated coupon interest rates. For information on annual debt maturities and interest payments, see Note 9.\n\nPurchase Obligations - Altria has entered into purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and services, contract manufacturing, packaging, storage and distribution) and other commitments for projected needs to be used in the normal course of business. Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). At December 31, 2021, purchase obligations for inventory and production costs for the next 12 months were $827 million and $1,274 million thereafter (a decrease from $1,095 million and $2,902 million at December 31, 2020, respectively, driven primarily by the Ste. Michelle Transaction).\n\nAt December 31, 2021, Altria had $609 million of other purchase obligation commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services, which occur through the ordinary course of business. Substantially all of these commitments are expected to be satisfied within 12 months. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected on Altria's consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2021 and are excluded from the amounts above.\n\nPayments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation - As discussed previously and in Note 18, PM USA has entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states and territories of the United States that call for certain payments. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. For further discussion of the resolutions of certain disputes with states and territories related to the NPM adjustment provision under the MSA, see Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation - NPM Adjustment Disputes in Note 18.\n\nBased on current agreements, estimated market share, estimated annual industry volume decline rates and inflation rates, the estimated amounts that Altria's subsidiaries may charge to cost of sales for payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are $4.4 billion on average for the next three years. These amounts exclude the potential impact of any NPM Adjustment Items.\n\nThe estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in the following year. The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred. Altria's subsidiaries paid approximately $4.7 billion and $4.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees. As previously stated, the payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, inflation and certain contingent events and, in general, are allocated based on each manufacturer's market share. The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results.\n\nLitigation-Related Deposits and Payments - With respect to certain adverse verdicts currently on appeal, to obtain stays of judgments pending appeals, as of December 31, 2021, PM USA had posted appeal bonds totaling $50 million, which have been collateralized with restricted cash that is included in assets on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nAlthough litigation is subject to uncertainty and an adverse outcome or settlement of litigation could have a material adverse effect on the financial position, cash flows or results of operations of PM USA, UST or Altria in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year, as more fully disclosed in Note 18, Item 3 and Item 1A, management expects cash flow from operations, together with Altria's access to capital markets, to provide sufficient liquidity to meet ongoing business needs.\n\nOther Long-Term Liabilities - Altria had $1.5 billion of accrued postretirement health care costs on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2021 and estimates approximately $100 million of annual payments. In addition, Altria has accrued pension obligations, substantially all of which are funded from plan assets. For further information on Altria's postretirement health care and pension",

Awards for employees and non-employee directors provide for accelerated vesting based on cumulative years of service with the Company. Compensation expense for the accelerated shares is recognized upon achievement of the long-service term. The cumulative amount of compensation cost recognized at any point in time equals at least the portion of the grant-date fair value of the award that is vested at that date. The fair value of RSUs is calculated as the market value of the common stock on the measurement date less the present value of the expected dividends forgone during the vesting period.\n\nStock-based compensation expense is predominantly included in SG&amp;A expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Certain stock-based compensation costs are capitalized or included in the cost of merchandise. See Note 7 for additional information on the Company's stock-based compensation plans.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credits and loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized.\n\nThe  timing  and  amounts  of  deductible  and  taxable  items  and  the  probability  of  sustaining  uncertain  tax  positions requires  significant  judgment.  The  benefits  of  uncertain  tax  positions  are  recorded  in  the  Company's  consolidated financial  statements  only  after  determining  a  more-likely-than-not  probability  that  the  uncertain  tax  positions  will withstand  challenge  from  tax  authorities.  When  facts  and  circumstances  change,  the  Company  reassesses  these probabilities and records any changes as appropriate.\n\n## Net Income per Common Share Attributable to Costco\n\nThe computation of basic net income per share uses the weighted average number of shares that were outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted net income per share uses the weighted average number of shares in the basic net income per share calculation plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming vesting of all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding using the treasury stock method for shares subject to RSUs.\n\n## Stock Repurchase Programs\n\nRepurchased shares of common stock are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. The par value of repurchased shares is deducted from common stock and the excess repurchase price over par value is deducted by allocation to additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. The amount allocated to additional paid-in capital is the current value of additional paid-in capital per share outstanding and is applied to the number of shares repurchased. Any remaining amount is allocated to retained earnings. See Note 6 for additional information.",

The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits recorded as components of other comprehensive earnings (losses) are subsequently amortized into net periodic benefit cost in future years.\n\n- Environmental Costs: Altria is subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Altria provides for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations on an undiscounted basis when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Such accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change.\n\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations, including the payment of any remediation and compliance costs or damages and the making of related expenditures, has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on Altria's consolidated results of operations, capital expenditures, financial position or cash flows. See Note 18. Contingencies -Environmental Regulation .\n\n- Fair Value Measurements: Altria measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Altria uses a fair value hierarchy, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are:\n- Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n- Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n- Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\n- Guarantees: Altria recognizes a liability for the fair value of the obligation of qualifying guarantee activities. See Note 18 . Contingencies for a further discussion of guarantees.\n- Income Taxes: Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Altria records a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Altria determines the realizability of deferred tax assets based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence. In reaching this determination, Altria considers the character of the assets and the possible sources of taxable income of the appropriate character within the available carryback and carryforward periods available under the tax law.\n\nAltria recognizes the financial statement benefit for uncertain income tax positions when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Altria recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes in its consolidated statements of earnings (losses).\n\n- Inventories: The last-in, first-out ('LIFO') method is used to determine the cost of substantially all tobacco inventories. The cost of the remaining inventories is determined using the first-in, first-out ('FIFO') and average cost methods. Inventories that are measured using the LIFO method are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventories that are measured using the FIFO and average cost methods are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. It is a generally recognized industry practice to classify leaf tobacco and wine inventories as current assets although part of such inventory, because of the duration of the curing and aging process, ordinarily would not be used within one year. The cost of approximately 81% and 59% of inventories at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, was determined using the LIFO method. The increase in LIFO percentage was due to the Ste. Michelle Transaction (as Ste. Michelle accounted for its inventory using FIFO). The stated LIFO amounts of inventories were approximately $0.6 billion lower than the current cost of inventories at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n- Investments in Equity Securities: Investments in equity securities in which Altria has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting or the fair value option.

      "answer": "The net difference between the change in total lease costs for COST and PM from 2023 to 2024 was $123 million. COST reduced its total lease costs by $90 million (from $692 million to $602 million), while PM increased its total lease costs by $45 million (from $403 million to $448 million). Therefore, the net difference between the two changes was $90 million (decrease) + $45 million (increase) = $135 million. $135 million represents the full magnitude of opposing movements in lease costs between the two companies over the period.",

      "answer": "Costco includes shipping and handling costs in merchandise costs and expenses them as incurred, while Philip Morris treats shipping and handling as fulfillment costs and accrues them if not yet incurred. If both companies incurred $100 million in shipping and handling costs, Costco would report the full $100 million as merchandise costs, and Philip Morris would accrue the $100 million as part of cost of sales when revenue is recognized. Therefore, both companies would reflect the $100 million in their cost structures, but the timing of recognition may differ based on when control transfers to the customer or the costs are incurred.",

These items were $64, $46 and $84 in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company recognizes sales for the amount of consideration collected from the member, which includes gross shipping fees where applicable, and is net of sales taxes collected and remitted to gov ernment agencies and member returns. The Company reserv es for estimated returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns and reduces sales and merchandise costs accordingly. The Company records, on a gross basis, a refund liability and an asset for recov ery, which are included in other current liabilities and other current assets, respectiv ely, in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe  Company offers merchandise in the following core merchandise categories: foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods.  The  Company also prov ides  expanded  products  and  serv ices  through  warehouse  ancillary  and  other  businesses.  T he  Company  is  the  principal  for  the  majority  of  its transactions and recognizes rev enue on a gross basis.  The  Company is the principal when it has control of the merchandise or serv ice before it is transferred to the member. The majority of rev enue from merchandise sales is recognized at the point of sale. Rev enue generated through e-commerce or special orders is generally recognized upon shipment to the member. For merchandise shipped directly to the member, shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred as fulfillment costs and included in merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income. In certain ancillary businesses, rev enue is deferred until the member picks up merchandise at the warehouse. Deferred sales are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe  Company  accounts  for  membership  fee  rev enue,  net  of  refunds,  on  a  deferred  basis,  ratably  ov er  the  one-year  membership  period.  Deferred membership fees at the end of 2024 and 2023 were $2,501 and $2,337.\n\nIn most countries, the Company's Executiv e members qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases, subject to an annual maximum v alue, which does not expire and is redeemable at Costco warehouses. The Company accounts for this reward as a reduction in sales, net of the estimated impact of nonredemptions (breakage), with the corresponding liability classified as accrued member rewards in the consolidated balance sheets. Estimated breakage is computed based on redemption data. For 2024, 2023, and 2022, the net reduction in sales was $2,804, $2,576, and $2,307.\n\nThe Company sells and otherwise prov ides proprietary shop cards that do not expire and are redeemable at the warehouse or online for merchandise or membership. Revenue from shop cards is recognized upon redemption, and estimated breakage is recognized based on redemption data. The Company accounts for  outstanding  shop  card  balances  as  a  shop  card  liability,  net  of  estimated  breakage.  Shop  card  liabilities  are  included  in  other  current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nCitibank, N.A. is the exclusiv e issuer of co-branded credit cards to U.S. members. The Company receiv es v arious forms of consideration from Citibank, including a royalty on purchases made on the card outside of Costco. A portion of the royalty is used to fund the rebate that cardholders receiv e, after taking into consideration breakage, which is calculated based on rebate redemption data. The rebates are issued in February and expire on December 31. The Company also maintains co-branded credit card arrangements in Canada and certain other International subsidiaries.\n\n## Merchandise Costs\n\nMerchandise costs consist of the purchase price or manufacturing costs of inv entory sold, inbound and outbound shipping charges and all costs related to the Company's depot, fulfillment and manufacturing operations, and are reduced by v endor consideration. Merchandise costs also include salaries, benefits, depreciation, and utilities in fresh foods departments and certain ancillary businesses.",

          "chunk_text": "## Income taxes\n\nIncome  taxes  are  provided  on  all  earnings  for  jurisdictions  outside  the  United  States. These  provisions,  as  well  as  state  and  local  income  tax   provisions,  are determined on a separate company basis, and the related assets and liabilities are recorded in PMI's consolidated balance sheets. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. PMI recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the  provision  for  income  tax es  on  the  consolidated  statements  of  earnings. PMI  recognizes  income  tax es  associated  with  G lobal  Intangible  Low-Tax ed  Income (\"GILTI\") taxes as current period expense rather than including these amounts in the measurement of deferred taxes.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The first-in, first-out and average cost methods are used to cost substantially all inventories. It is a generally recognized industry practice to classify leaf tobacco inventory as a current asset, although part of such inventory, because of the duration of the aging process, ordinarily would not be utilized within one year.\n\n## Leases\n\nPMI determines that a contract contains a lease if the contract conveys a right to control the use of the identified asset for a period of time in exchange  for consideration. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance lease expense is amortized based on production activity or the  lease  term. Lease ex pense is recorded in cost of sales or marketing, administration and research costs depending on the nature of the leased item. At lease commencement, PMI recognizes lease liabilities and the corresponding right-of-use assets (at the present value of future payments) for predominately all of its leases. The recognition of the right-of-use asset and lease liability includes renewal options when it is reasonably certain that they will be ex ercised. Certain of PMI's leases include payments that are based on changes to an index or on actual usage. These lease payments are adjusted periodically and are included within variable lease costs. PMI accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single-lease component with the exception of its vehicle leases, of which PMI accounts for the lease components separately from the nonlease components. Additionally, leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not included in the right-of-use asset or lease liability on the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n## Marketing costs\n\nPMI supports its products with advertising, adult consumer engagement and trade promotions. Such programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, rebates, instore display incentives, e-commerce, mobile and other digital platforms, adult consumer activation and promotion activities, as well as costs associated with adult consumer experience outlets and other adult consumer touchpoints and volume-based incentives. Advertising, as well as certain consumer engagement and trade activities costs, are ex pensed as incurred. Trade promotions are recorded as a reduction of revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers at the end of a period, based principally on historical utilization. For interim reporting purposes, advertising and certain consumer engagement expenses are charged to earnings based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nPMI recognizes revenue primarily through the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and smoke-free products, including heat-not-burn, vapor and oral nicotine products. The majority of PMI revenues are generated by sales through direct and indirect distribution networks with short-term payment conditions and where control is typically transferred to the customer either upon shipment or delivery of goods. PMI evaluates the transfer of control through evidence of the customer's receipt and acceptance, transfer of title, PMI's right to payment for those products and the customer's ability to direct the use of those products upon receipt.  Typically, PMI's performance obligations are satisfied and revenue is recognized either upon shipment or delivery of goods.\n\nIn certain instances, PMI facilitates shipping and handling activities after control has transferred to the customer. PMI has elected to record all shipping and handling activities as costs to fulfill a contract. The shipping and handling costs that have not been incurred at the time revenue is recognized are accrued.  PMI is a principal for majority of its arrangements and recognizes revenue at the transaction price, with the associated costs recorded in cost of sales. The transaction price is typically based on the amount billed to the customer and includes estimated variable consideration, where applicable. Such variable consideration is typically not constrained and is estimated based on the most likely amount that PMI expects to be entitled to under the terms of the contracts with customers, historical experience of discount or rebate redemption, where relevant, and the terms of any underlying discount or rebate programs, which may change from time to time as the business and product categories  evolve. For arrangements where PMI acts as an agent, the net commission earned is recognized as revenue. PMI has elected to exclude excise taxes collected from customers from the measurement of the transaction price, thereby presenting revenues net of excise taxes. Estimated costs associated with warranty programs are generally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized.",

      "answer": "Costco's retirement plans, including its 401(k) plan in the U.S. and defined contribution plans in Canada, resulted in expenses of $963 million in 2024. These contributions are discretionary and primarily included in SG&A expenses. In contrast, Philip Morris reported employee contributions of $157 million in 2024 toward its pension plans, which are part of a larger defined benefit structure with a total benefit obligation of $10,456 million at year-end. The structured nature of Philip Morris's pension obligations, including employer and employee contributions, leads to a more complex liability framework compared to Costco\u2019s primarily defined contribution approach. This distinction results in Costco having more predictable and controllable retirement-related financial obligations, while Philip Morris faces larger long-term liabilities tied to its pension benefit obligations.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Vendor Consideration\n\nThe Company receives funds from v endors for discounts and a v ariety of other programs. These programs are ev idenced by agreements that are reflected in  the  carrying  v alue  of  the  inv entory  when  earned  or  as  the  Company  progresses  towards  earning  the  rebate  or  discount,  and  as  a  component  of merchandise costs as the merchandise is sold. Other v endor consideration is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, agreement terms or another systematic approach.\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\nSelling, general and administrativ e expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and workers' compensation costs for warehouse employees (other than  fresh  foods  departments  and  certain  ancillary  businesses,  which  are  reflected  in  merchandise  costs)  as  well  as  all  regional  and  home  office employees, including buying personnel. Selling, general and administrativ e expenses also include substantially all building and equipment depreciation, stock  compensation  expense,  credit  and  debit  card  processing  fees,  utilities,  preopening,  as  well  as  other  operating  costs  incurred  to  support warehouse and e-commerce operations.\n\n## Retirement Plans\n\nThe Company's 401(k) retirement plan is av ailable to all U.S. employees ov er the age of 18 who hav e completed 90 days of employment. The plan allows participants to make wage deferral contributions, a portion of which the Company matches. In addition, the Company prov ides each eligible participant an annual discretionary contribution. T he Company also has a defined contribution plan for employees in Canada and contributes a percentage of each employee's wages. Certain subsidiaries in the Company's Other International operations hav e defined benefit and defined contribution plans, which are immaterial. Amounts expensed under all plans were $963, $914, and $824 for 2024, 2023, and 2022, and are predominantly included in SG&amp;A expenses in the consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nThe  Company  grants  stock-based  compensation,  primarily  to  employees  and  non-employee  directors.  Grants  to  executiv e  officers  are  generally performance-based. Through a series of shareholder approv als, there hav e been amended and restated plans and new prov isions implemented by the Company. Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) granted to employees and to non-employee directors generally v est ov er fiv e years and three years and are subject to quarterly v esting in the ev ent of retirement or v oluntary termination. Employees who attain at least 25 years of serv ice with the Company and non-employee directors with fiv e or more years receiv e shares under accelerated v esting prov isions. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.\n\nCompensation expense for awards is predominantly recognized using the straight-line method ov er the requisite serv ice period for the entire award. The terms of the RSUs, including performance-based awards, prov ide for accelerated v esting for employees and non-employee directors. Recipients are not entitled  to  v ote  or  receiv e  div idends  on  unv ested  and  undeliv ered  shares.  Compensation  expense  for  the  accelerated  shares  is  recognized  upon achiev ement of the long-serv ice term. T he cumulativ e amount of compensation cost recognized at any point in time equals at least the portion of the grant-date fair  v alue  of  the  award  that  is  v ested  at  that  date.  T he  fair  v alue  of  RSUs  is  calculated  as  the  market  v alue  of  the  common  stock  on  the measurement date less the present v alue of the expected div idends forgone during the v esting period.\n\nStock-based  compensation  expense  is  predominantly  included  in  SG&amp;A  expenses  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  income.  Certain  stock-based compensation costs are capitalized or included in the cost of merchandise. See Note 7 for additional information.",

      "answer": "For PM, the foreign exchange impact on the effective tax rate increased from -1.6% in 2023 to 1.7% in 2024, contributing to a rise in the effective tax rate. Meanwhile, the impact of global intangible low-taxed income decreased from 2.0% in 2023 to 1.7% in 2024, slightly reducing the effective tax rate. These changes, among others, caused PM's effective tax rate to rise from 22.4% in 2023 to 24.7% in 2024. In contrast, COST's effective tax rate decreased from 25.9% in 2023 to 24.4% in 2024.

In contrast, PMI's accounting policy indicates that variable lease costs are adjusted periodically based on changes to an index or actual usage, and are included in the lease expense depending on the nature of the leased item. This reveals that while COST's exposure is fixed at the reported $163 million for 2024, PMI's exposure to variable lease costs is dynamic and subject to ongoing adjustments based on external factors like usage or inflation indices, leading to potential variability in future financial statements.",

          "chunk_text": "## Income taxes\n\nIncome  taxes  are  provided  on  all  earnings  for  jurisdictions  outside  the  United  States. These  provisions,  as  well  as  state  and  local  income  tax   provisions,  are determined on a separate company basis, and the related assets and liabilities are recorded in PMI's consolidated balance sheets. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. PMI recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the  provision  for  income  tax es  on  the  consolidated  statements  of  earnings. PMI  recognizes  income  tax es  associated  with  G lobal  Intangible  Low-Tax ed  Income (\"GILTI\") taxes as current period expense rather than including these amounts in the measurement of deferred taxes.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The first-in, first-out and average cost methods are used to cost substantially all inventories. It is a generally recognized industry practice to classify leaf tobacco inventory as a current asset, although part of such inventory, because of the duration of the aging process, ordinarily would not be utilized within one year.\n\n## Leases\n\nPMI determines that a contract contains a lease if the contract conveys a right to control the use of the identified asset for a period of time in exchange  for consideration. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance lease expense is amortized based on production activity or the  lease  term. Lease ex pense is recorded in cost of sales or marketing, administration and research costs depending on the nature of the leased item. At lease commencement, PMI recognizes lease liabilities and the corresponding right-of-use assets (at the present value of future payments) for predominately all of its leases. The recognition of the right-of-use asset and lease liability includes renewal options when it is reasonably certain that they will be ex ercised. Certain of PMI's leases include payments that are based on changes to an index or on actual usage. These lease payments are adjusted periodically and are included within variable lease costs. PMI accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single-lease component with the exception of its vehicle leases, of which PMI accounts for the lease components separately from the nonlease components. Additionally, leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not included in the right-of-use asset or lease liability on the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n## Marketing costs\n\nPMI supports its products with advertising, adult consumer engagement and trade promotions. Such programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, rebates, instore display incentives, e-commerce, mobile and other digital platforms, adult consumer activation and promotion activities, as well as costs associated with adult consumer experience outlets and other adult consumer touchpoints and volume-based incentives. Advertising, as well as certain consumer engagement and trade activities costs, are ex pensed as incurred. Trade promotions are recorded as a reduction of revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers at the end of a period, based principally on historical utilization. For interim reporting purposes, advertising and certain consumer engagement expenses are charged to earnings based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nPMI recognizes revenue primarily through the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and smoke-free products, including heat-not-burn, vapor and oral nicotine products. The majority of PMI revenues are generated by sales through direct and indirect distribution networks with short-term payment conditions and where control is typically transferred to the customer either upon shipment or delivery of goods. PMI evaluates the transfer of control through evidence of the customer's receipt and acceptance, transfer of title, PMI's right to payment for those products and the customer's ability to direct the use of those products upon receipt.  Typically, PMI's performance obligations are satisfied and revenue is recognized either upon shipment or delivery of goods.\n\nIn certain instances, PMI facilitates shipping and handling activities after control has transferred to the customer. PMI has elected to record all shipping and handling activities as costs to fulfill a contract. The shipping and handling costs that have not been incurred at the time revenue is recognized are accrued.  PMI is a principal for majority of its arrangements and recognizes revenue at the transaction price, with the associated costs recorded in cost of sales. The transaction price is typically based on the amount billed to the customer and includes estimated variable consideration, where applicable. Such variable consideration is typically not constrained and is estimated based on the most likely amount that PMI expects to be entitled to under the terms of the contracts with customers, historical experience of discount or rebate redemption, where relevant, and the terms of any underlying discount or rebate programs, which may change from time to time as the business and product categories  evolve. For arrangements where PMI acts as an agent, the net commission earned is recognized as revenue. PMI has elected to exclude excise taxes collected from customers from the measurement of the transaction price, thereby presenting revenues net of excise taxes. Estimated costs associated with warranty programs are generally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized.",

      "answer": "COST actively uses forward foreign-exchange contracts valued at $1,212 million in 2024 to hedge against foreign-currency exchange-rate fluctuations, particularly for U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures by its international subsidiaries. These contracts are not speculative and are used to economically mitigate exchange risk, although they do not qualify for hedge accounting. In contrast, PM's 2024 operating income variance shows a $205 million favorable impact from foreign currency fluctuations, indicating that exchange rate movements had a measurable effect on its financial performance. This implies that while COST proactively hedges to reduce such impacts, PM experienced a direct financial benefit from currency movements, suggesting differing exposures or hedging strategies between the two companies.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - COST uses forward foreign-exchange contracts valued at $1,212 million to hedge foreign exchange risk on U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures.",

The contracts relate primarily to U.S. dollar merchandise inv entory expenditures made by the  Company's international subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the  U.S. dollar.  Currently, these contracts do not qualify for deriv ativ e hedge accounting. The Company seeks to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and does not intend to engage in speculativ e transactions.

The Company also enters into v ariable-priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for its gas stations,  on  an  index  basis.

      "question": "How does Costco's policy on repurchased share retirement affect its calculation of diluted net income per share, and how does this differ in reporting approach from Philip Morris's disclosure regarding repurchased shares?",
      "answer": "Costco's policy on repurchased shares involves retiring them in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. This affects its diluted net income per share calculation because the treasury stock method is used to account for potentially dilutive common shares, such as those subject to RSUs, by adjusting the weighted average number of shares outstanding. In contrast, Philip Morris provides a quantitative disclosure of the issued, repurchased, and outstanding shares without specifying a retirement policy or its implications on earnings per share calculations. Therefore, Costco's detailed policy on share retirement and its impact on diluted EPS contrasts with Philip Morris's more general disclosure about repurchased shares.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Costco retires repurchased shares and uses the treasury stock method in its diluted net income per share calculation.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - The retirement of shares affects the allocation to common stock, additional paid-in capital, and retained earnings.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b - Philip Morris discloses data on issued, repurchased, and outstanding shares but does not specify a retirement policy or its impact on EPS.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - Costco provides a detailed explanation of how share repurchases and retirement affect financial metrics like diluted EPS, while Philip Morris does not disclose such mechanisms."

Deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are  recognized  for  the  future  tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases, credits and loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be recov ered or settled. T he effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A v aluation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized.\n\nThe timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions requires significant judgment.  The benefits  of  uncertain  tax  positions  are  recorded  in  the  Company's  consolidated  financial  statements  only  after  determining  a  more-likely-than-not probability  that  the  uncertain  tax  positions  will  withstand  challenge  from  tax  authorities.  When  facts  and  circumstances  change,  the  Company reassesses these probabilities and records changes as appropriate.\n\n## Net Income per Common Share Attributable to Costco\n\nThe computation of basic net income per share uses the weighted av erage number of shares that were outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted net income per share uses the weighted av erage number of shares in the basic net income per share calculation plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming v esting of all potentially dilutiv e common shares outstanding using the treasury stock method for shares subject to RSUs.\n\n## Stock Repurchase Programs\n\nRepurchased shares of common stock are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. The par v alue of repurchased shares is deducted  from  common  stock  and  the  excess  repurchase  price  ov er  par  v alue  is  deducted  by  allocation  to  additional  paid-in  capital  and  retained earnings. The amount allocated to additional paid-in capital is the current v alue of additional paid-in capital per share outstanding and is applied to the number of shares repurchased. Any remaining amount is allocated to retained earnings. See Note 6 for additional information.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\n\nIn  Nov ember  2023,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (FASB)  issued  Accounting  Standards  Update  (ASU)  2023-07,  which  is  intended  to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily about significant segment expenses. The standard is effectiv e for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectiv ely to all prior periods presented in the financial statements.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, which focuses on income tax disclosures by requiring public business entities, on an annual basis, to  disclose  specific  categories  in  the  rate  reconciliation,  prov ide  information  for  reconciling  items  that  meet  a  quantitativ e  threshold,  and  certain information about income taxes paid. The standard is effectiv e for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied on a prospectiv e basis. Retrospectiv e application is permitted.\n\nThe Company is evaluating both standards.",

      "answer": "PM experienced a 9.3% increase in operating income, which was partly offset by higher manufacturing costs, primarily due to the increased cost of tobacco leaf. This contrasts with COST's exposure to rising commodity prices, such as gasoline and consumable goods used in manufacturing and warehouse operations, which are subject to volatility and could not always be passed on to consumers without negatively affecting demand. The causal mechanism is that PM absorbed some cost increases (like tobacco leaf), limiting operating income growth, while COST faced similar inflationary pressures that constrained its ability to maintain profit margins without demand erosion. Both companies are affected by rising input costs, but the impact manifests differently due to sector-specific pricing power and cost structures.",

      "answer": "Fluctuations in currency exchange rates influence COST's comparable sales growth by affecting the financial performance of its international operations, which can either enhance or hinder profitability depending on the direction of the fluctuation. At PM, currency exchange rate changes indirectly affect pension expense projections by influencing the value of international assets and liabilities, which are part of the complex tax and asset recovery calculations. The combined impact of these effects leads COST to focus on pricing strategies and leveraging sales growth to offset international volatility, while PM must adjust pension liabilities and tax provisions based on changing currency values, requiring both companies to implement hedging and strategic financial planning.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - COST's comparable sales growth is influenced by currency exchange rate fluctuations in international operations.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - PM's pension expense is affected by changes in currency exchange rates through tax provisions and asset valuations.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies must incorporate currency risk into their financial planning, with COST focusing on sales leverage and PM adjusting pension and tax liabilities."

MD&amp;A is prov ided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). This section generally discusses the results of operations for 2024 compared to 2023. For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for 2023 compared to 2022 refer to Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our fiscal year 2023 Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on October 11, 2023.\n\n## Overview\n\nWe  believ e  that  the  most  important  driv er  of  our  profitability  is  increasing  net  sales,  particularly  comparable  sales.  Net  sales  includes  our  core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary (gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire installation) and other businesses (e-commerce, business centers, trav el and other). E-commerce and business center sales are allocated to the appropriate merchandise categories in the Net Sales discussion. Comparable sales is defined as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce sites operating for more than one year.

The anticipated increase is primarily due to higher amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses of $45 million, coupled with higher service cost of $17 million, partially offset by higher expected return on assets of $20 million, coupled with lower interest cost of $30 million and other movements of $4 million.\n\nWeighted-average expected rate of return and discount rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amount of expense reported for the employee benefit plans. A fifty-basis-point decrease in our discount rate would increase our 2025 pension and postretirement expense by approximately $56 million, and a fifty-basispoint increase in our discount rate would decrease our 2025 pension and postretirement expense by approximately $46 million. Similarly, a fifty-basis-point decrease (increase) in the ex pected return on plan assets would increase (decrease) our 2025 pension expense by approximately $44 million.\n\nIncome T axes Income tax provisions for jurisdictions outside the United States, as well as state and local income tax provisions, are determined on a separate company basis, and the related assets and liabilities are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe extent of our operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax  audits. In accordance with the authoritative guidance for income taxes, we evaluate potential tax exposures and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax  liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to ex pense would generally result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax  benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.\n\nWe are required to assess the likelihood of recovering deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income. If we determine, using all available evidence, that we do not reach the more likely than not threshold for recovery, a valuation allowance is recorded.  Significant judgment is required in determining the need for and amount of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets including estimates of future taxable income in the applicable jurisdictions and the feasibility of on-going tax planning strategies, as applicable.\n\nThe effective tax rates used for interim reporting are based on our full-year geographic earnings mix projections. Changes in currency exchange rates, earnings mix by taxing  jurisdiction  or  future  regulatory  developments  may  have  an  impact  on  the  effective  tax   rates. Significant  judgment  is  required  in  determining  income  tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions.\n\nFor further details, see Item 8, Note 12. Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements.\n\nHedging As discussed below in 'Market Risk,' we use derivative financial instruments principally to reduce exposures to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates by creating offsetting exposures. For derivative contracts that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk, is recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings. For our other derivatives to which we have elected to apply hedge accounting, gains and losses on these derivatives are initially deferred in accumulated other",

Net  sales  includes  our  core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary (gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire installation) and other businesses (e-commerce, business centers, trav el and other). E-commerce and business center sales are allocated to the appropriate merchandise categories in the Net Sales discussion. Comparable sales is defined as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce sites operating for more than one year. The measure is intended as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and should be reviewed  in  conjunction  with  results  reported  in  accordance  with  U.S.  GAAP.  Comparable  sales  growth  is  achiev ed  through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each v isit (av erage ticket). Sales comparisons can also be  particularly  influenced  by  certain  factors  that  are  beyond  our  control:  fluctuations  in  currency  exchange  rates  (with  respect  to  our  international operations) and inflation or deflation in the cost of gasoline and associated competitiv e conditions.

We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, R&amp;D, innovation, packaging, customer service, marketing, advertising and retail price. The competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions; erosion of consumer confidence; competitors' introduction of lower-price products or innovative products; adult smoker willingness to convert to our SFPs; higher product taxes; higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories; unfair competition; and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products, restricts adult consumer access to truthful and non-misleading information about our SFPs, or disproportionately impacts the commercialization of our products in relation to our competitors.\n\nCompetitors in our industry include Altria G roup, Inc., British American Tobacco plc, Japan Tobacco Inc., Imperial Brands plc, new market entrants, particularly with respect to innovative products, several regional and local tobacco companies and, in some instances, state-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in Algeria, Egypt, China,  Taiwan,  Thailand  and  V ietnam.  Some  competitors  have  different  profit,  volume  and  regulatory  objectives,  some  international  competitors  may  be  less susceptible than  PMI to changes in currency exchange rates, and some competitors may sell products in circumvention of applicable regulations that compete directly  with  our  products.  Certain  new  market  entrants  in  the  non-combustible  product  category  may  alienate  consumers  from  innovative  products  through inappropriate marketing campaigns, messaging and inferior product satisfaction, and without scientific substantiation based on appropriate R&amp;D protocols and standards. The growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the dissemination of inaccurate and misleading information about our SFPs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations. See Item 1, Business-Competition for a description of the competitive environment in which we operate.\n\n## We may be unable to anticipate changes in adult consumer preferences.\n\nOur  business  is  subject  to  changes  in  adult  consumer  preferences,  which  may  be  influenced  by  local  economic  conditions,  accessibility  to  our  products  and availability of accurate information related to our products.\n\n## To be successful, we must:\n\n- promote brand equity successfully;\n- anticipate and respond to new adult consumer trends;\n- ensure that our products meet our quality standards;\n- develop new products and markets and broaden brand portfolios;\n- improve productivity;\n- educate and encourage adult smokers to convert to our SFPs;\n- ensure effective adult consumer engagement, including communication about product characteristics and usage of SFPs;\n- mitigate the impact of developments that cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands;\n- provide excellent customer care;\n- ensure adequate production capacity to meet demand for our products; and\n- be able to protect or enhance margins through price increases.\n\nIn periods of economic uncertainty, adult consumers may tend to purchase low-price brands, and the volume of our premium-price and mid-price brands and our profitability could be materially adversely impacted as a result. Such down-trading trends may be reinforced by regulation that limits branding, communication and product differentiation. In addition to economic uncertainty (including recessions and inflation) unusual weather events and global or local epidemics, endemics or pandemics (such as COVID-19) has and may change the preferences of our adult consumers and lower demand for our products, particularly for our mid-price or premium-price brands.\n\n## Our ability to grow profitability may be limited by our inability to introduce new products, enter new markets, maintain sufficient production capacity, or improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix.\n\nOur profit growth may be materially adversely impacted if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully, to meet the demand for our products with increased production capacity, to raise prices, or to improve the proportion of our sales of higher margin products and in higher margin geographies.",

If our management fails to account for other relevant information or substitute the key business metrics they review as our business changes or if the assumptions or estimates underlying the metrics are inaccurate, their ability to accurately formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions may be compromised and our business, financial results and future growth prospects may be adversely impacted.\n\nRisks Related to the Impact of the War in Ukraine on our Business\n\n## Our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position may be adversely impacted by the continuation and consequences of the war in Ukraine.\n\nIn  2024,  Russia  accounted  for  around  9%  of  our  total  cigarette  and  heated  tobacco  unit  shipment  volume,  and  around  6%  of  our  total  net  revenues.  Ukraine accounted for around 2% of our total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume, and around 1% of our total net revenues. Historically, we also produced finished goods in Ukraine for export and manufactured products in Russia. In 2022, as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, we suspended planned investments and scaled down our manufacturing operations in Russia.\n\nThe full implications of the Russian invasion of Ukraine for our operations in those countries are impossible to predict at this time. The likelihood of retaliatory action by the  Russian  government  against  companies,  including  PMI,  as  a  result  of  actions  and  statements  made  in  response  to  the  Russian  invasion  or  otherwise, including the possibility of legal action against us or our employees; the deprivation of rights in, or access to, our Russian or Russia-related assets; or nationalization of foreign businesses or assets (including cash reserves held in Russia and intangible assets such as trademarks), is impossible to predict. We are continuously assessing the evolving situation in Russia, including regulatory constraints in the market entailing very complex terms and conditions that must be met for any divestment transaction to be granted approval by the authorities, and restrictions resulting from international regulations. In the event of a divestment, our ability to fully realize the value of the business would likely be subject to material impairment. The deprivation of rights in, or access to, our Russian or Russia-related assets could also result in a material impairment and could cause the deconsolidation of our Russian business. In Ukraine, there is no way to know when and to what extent we will be able to fully normalize our operations or to what extent our workforce, facilities, inventory, and other assets will remain intact. These developments have and will continue to have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position, and may result in further impairment charges.\n\nThe conflict also continues to elevate the likelihood of supply chain disruptions, both in the region and globally, and may inhibit our ability to timely source materials and services needed to make and sell our products. For example, historically we sourced certain finished goods, production materials and components from both Russia and Ukraine, including printed materials and filters, and the invasion has, and may continue to, disrupt the availability of and impact our supply chain for these materials. These disruptions, to the extent we are unable to find alternative sources or otherwise address these supply constraints, may impact the availability and cost of our products in other markets, which would adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position, and may result in impairment charges. Furthermore, the imposition of various restrictions on transactions with parties from certain jurisdictions, the ban on exports of various products, and  other  economic  and  financial  restrictions  may  adversely  affect  certain  third  parties  with  which  we  do  business  in  Russia,  such  as  customers,  suppliers, intermediaries, service providers and banks.\n\nThe broader consequences of the invasion are also impossible to predict, but could include reputational consequences, further sanctions, financial or currency restrictions,  punitive  tax   law  changes,  embargoes,  regional  instability,  and  geopolitical  shifts  as  well  as  adverse  effects  on  macroeconomic  conditions,  security conditions, currency exchange rates, and financial markets. G iven the nature of our business and global operations, such geo-political instability and uncertainty could increase the costs of our materials and operations; reduce demand for our products; have a negative impact on our supply chains, manufacturing capabilities, or  distribution  capabilities;  increase  our  ex posure  to  currency  fluctuations;  constrain  our  liquidity  or  our  ability  to  access  capital  markets;  create  staffing  or operations difficulties; or subject us to increased cyber-attacks. While we will continue to monitor this fluid situation and develop contingency plans as necessary to address any disruptions to our business operations as they develop, the extent of the conflict's effect on our business and results of operations as well as the global economy, cannot be predicted.\n\nThe conflict may also heighten many other risks disclosed in this Form 10-K, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Such risks could affect, without limitation, the achievement of our strategic priorities, including achievement of our smoke-free business growth targets; the availability of third-party manufacturing resources; the availability of attractive acquisition and strategic business opportunities and our ability to fully realize the benefits of these transactions; our ability to attract, motivate, and retain the best global talent; and our loss of revenue from counterfeiting and similar illicit activities.",

      "answer": "PG added $3,997 million in long-term debt during fiscal year 2023, while TGT added $0, indicating divergent capital structure strategies. PG appears to be leveraging more debt financing, potentially to fund growth initiatives or acquisitions, as seen in prior years with significant capital expenditures and acquisitions. In contrast, TGT pursued a debt-reduction strategy, evidenced by net reductions in long-term debt and significant stock repurchases in previous years, signaling a preference for equity-centric financial management.",

      "answer": "The combined Earnings Before Income Taxes (EBIT) for Procter & Gamble and Target in fiscal year 2023 is $23.653 billion. This includes $18.353 billion from PG and $3.4 billion from TGT. TGT reported that $1.3 billion of its EBIT in 2023 was earned by foreign entities subject to tax outside the U.S., which suggests that TGT's U.S. tax exposure may be lower due to the geographic distribution of its earnings. This geographic segmentation of income contrasts with PG's EBIT, which does not specify foreign tax breakdowns in the provided data, potentially making PG's tax exposure more concentrated within the U.S. context.",

      "answer": "A 1 percentage point increase in floating interest rates would increase the combined earnings before income taxes of Procter & Gamble and Target Corporation by $5 million. This is because Target Corporation would see a $5 million increase in earnings before income taxes due to its floating rate short-term investments exceeding floating rate debt, while Procter & Gamble's 2023 earnings before income taxes were $18,353 million, and they had no direct positive impact from interest rate changes on their earnings before income taxes.",

      "answer": "Procter & Gamble provides a detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures, such as Core EPS of $6.59 for fiscal year 2024, which adjusts GAAP EPS of $6.02 by adding $0.15 from restructuring and $0.42 from intangible impairment. This level of specificity enhances transparency. In contrast, Target mentions Adjusted EPS without disclosing specific dollar amounts or detailed reconciliations, stating only that it excludes certain items for period-to-period comparability. As a result, P&G's detailed breakdown allows for more precise comparability of its operational performance, while Target's Adjusted EPS lacks the specificity needed for similar analysis.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Procter & Gamble reports a GAAP EPS of $6.02 and a Core (Non-GAAP) EPS of $6.59, with adjustments of $0.15 from restructuring and $0.42 from intangible impairment.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Target discusses Adjusted EPS as a non-GAAP metric that excludes certain items but does not provide specific dollar amounts or a reconciliation table.",

Target\u2019s lack of specific figures limits such analysis, making it harder to assess the true impact of exclusions on Adjusted EPS."

      "question": "How did the exclusion of restructuring and intangible impairment charges impact P&G's adjusted EPS compared to Target's approach to Adjusted EPS, given Target's focus on period-to-period operational comparisons?",
      "answer": "P&G's adjusted EPS for fiscal year 2024 was $6.59, which excluded $0.15 from restructuring charges and $0.42 from intangible impairment charges. In contrast, Target mentions Adjusted EPS as a non-GAAP metric that excludes certain items to enable period-to-period operational comparisons, though specific adjustments are not quantified. The exclusion of restructuring and intangible impairment charges at P&G meaningfully increased its EPS compared to the GAAP EPS of $6.02, demonstrating how adjustments can influence the perception of financial performance. Target\u2019s qualitative description suggests a similar intent to enhance comparability, but without specific adjustments quantified, a direct numerical comparison is limited.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - P&G's GAAP EPS is $6.02, and its adjusted EPS is $6.59, with $0.15 attributed to restructuring charges and $0.42 to intangible impairment charges being excluded.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Target defines Adjusted EPS as a non-GAAP measure that excludes certain items to improve period-to-period comparisons of operational results, though specific adjustments are not quantified.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - P&G explicitly quantifies the impact of exclusions on EPS, while Target describes the purpose of Adjusted EPS similarly but does not disclose specific figures. This allows for a comparison of how each company approaches non-GAAP EPS adjustments, with P&G showing a clear $0.57 increase in EPS due to exclusions."

      "answer": "P&G demonstrated a strong commitment to shareholder returns through both dividends and share repurchases. Specifically, P&G reaffirmed a $5 to $6 billion share repurchase program for fiscal year 2024 and has increased its dividend for 68 consecutive years, with a 5% annual compound average growth rate over the past decade. In contrast, while Target mentioned its intentions regarding future dividends and share repurchases in its forward-looking statements, it did not specify a comparable level of commitment or quantify its repurchase program. This suggests that P&G prioritized returning capital to shareholders more aggressively than Target during the same period.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - P&G reaffirmed a $5 to $6 billion share repurchase program for fiscal year 2024 and has increased its dividend for 68 consecutive years, with a 5% annual compound average growth rate over the past decade.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Target referenced its intentions regarding future dividends and share repurchases in its forward-looking statements but did not quantify its repurchase program or specify a comparable dividend growth history.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The contrast in specificity and magnitude of shareholder return commitments between the two companies indicates differing financial priorities, with P&G emphasizing consistent and substantial returns to shareholders, while Target maintained a more general and less quantified approach."

      "answer": "PG does not explicitly disclose its total share-based compensation expense for 2023, but it states that such expenses are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period and are included in both Cost of Products Sold and SG&A expenses. TGT, on the other hand, explicitly reports that its share-based compensation expense recognized in SG&A Expenses was $255 million in 2023. Therefore, while TGT contributes a concrete figure of $255 million, PG's amount remains undisclosed, making the total uncomputable from the given data.",

        "Step 1: From PG's 10-K filing, we learn that the company recognizes share-based compensation expense based on the fair value of awards at the grant date, and this expense is included in Cost of Products Sold and SG&A in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. However, no explicit dollar amount for the expense in 2023 is provided.",
        "Step 2: From TGT's 10-K filing, we find that the company explicitly discloses its share-based compensation expense recognized in SG&A Expenses as $255 million in 2023.",
        "Step 3: To determine the total share-based compensation expense for both companies, we would need to sum the amounts from PG and TGT. However, since PG does not provide a specific dollar figure, the total cannot be calculated."

      "answer": "Target withheld $127 million in cash for taxes on share-based compensation in 2023. In contrast, Procter & Gamble's share-based compensation programs include stock options, RSUs, and PSUs, with expense recognition based on fair value at the grant date and expensed on a straight-line basis over the service period. P&G also accounts for forfeitures based on historical data, and its compensation expense is included in Cost of Products Sold and SG&A. This suggests that while both companies utilize share-based compensation, P&G's approach is more detailed and structured around long-term incentives, whereas Target's disclosure focuses on the cash impact of tax withholdings related to these programs.",

      "answer": "PG reports derivative assets in 'Other noncurrent assets' and states that the fair value of these assets directly offsets the cumulative fair value hedging adjustment in the carrying amount of underlying debt obligations, which was $2.7 billion as of June 30, 2024. This offset mechanism ensures that changes in fair value are reflected in the financial statements through the hedging relationship. TGT, on the other hand, categorizes derivative financial instruments in its financial disclosures under 'Other Noncurrent Assets' as per Note 12 of its 10-K filing, indicating alignment in the classification of long-term derivative instruments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - PG reports derivative assets in 'Other noncurrent assets' and specifies that the fair value of these assets offsets the hedging adjustment in the carrying amount of debt, which was $2.7 billion as of June 30, 2024.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - TGT's 10-K filing shows that it reports derivative financial instruments under the category 'Other Noncurrent Assets' in Note 12.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The fair value hedging mechanism described by PG explains how derivative assets affect the debt carrying value, and TGT's disclosure reveals that both companies use the same financial statement category for similar instruments, showing consistency in financial reporting practices."
