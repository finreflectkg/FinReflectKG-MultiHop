      "question": "What is the combined total of noncurrent derivative liabilities for Duke Energy and NextEra Energy (NEE) as of December 31, 2021, and how does this reflect their respective mark-to-market energy contract net liability positions?",
      "answer": "The combined total of noncurrent derivative liabilities for Duke Energy and NextEra Energy (NEE) as of December 31, 2021, is $1,140 million. Duke Energy reported $117 million in noncurrent derivative liabilities related to commodity contracts and $21 million in noncurrent derivative liabilities related to interest rate contracts, totaling $138 million. NextEra Energy reported $1,023 million in noncurrent derivative liabilities. Adding these together ($138 million + $1,023 million) results in $1,161 million in noncurrent derivative liabilities. Additionally, Duke Energy\u2019s total derivative liabilities were $472 million, of which $138 million were noncurrent, while NEE\u2019s total mark-to-market energy contract net liabilities were $441 million, indicating that both companies carried significant derivative exposure, with NEE\u2019s liabilities being notably higher.",

Duke Energy reported $134 million in noncurrent commodity contract liabilities for 2024, while NextEra Energy reported $2,741 million in noncurrent derivative liabilities for 2023. Adding these amounts gives a total exposure of $2,875 million, which highlights the significant combined financial obligation both companies hold in long-term derivative liabilities.",

Reserve amortization, or reversal of such amortization, reflects adjustments to accrued asset removal costs provided under the 2021 rate agreement in order to achieve the targeted regulatory ROE. Reserve amortization is recorded as either an increase or decrease to accrued asset removal costs which is reflected in noncurrent regulatory assets on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets.

This total fuel and power expense is significantly higher than DUK's total segment income of $1,067 million in 2024, indicating that the combined cost of fuel and power for both companies far exceeds DUK\u2019s segment income alone.",

      "answer": "NEE manages commodity price risk through its Exposure Management Committee (EMC), which includes senior management and the CEO, and utilizes a value-at-risk (VaR) model to estimate potential losses at a 95% confidence level. In contrast, Southern Company relies on a network of subsidiaries and service companies like AGL Services Company and Atlanta Gas Light to manage utility operations, indicating a more decentralized operational structure.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - NEE's Exposure Management Committee (EMC) oversees commodity risk management, and NEE uses a VaR model to estimate market risk.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Southern Company utilizes subsidiary entities such as AGL Services Company and Atlanta Gas Light to manage utility operations.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While NEE centralizes risk oversight through a dedicated committee and quantitative models, Southern Company distributes operational responsibilities across its subsidiaries, reflecting different governance approaches aligned with their respective business models."

      "answer": "NEE reported $2,496 million in prepaid pension benefit costs at year-end 2024, while SO's prepaid pension and other postretirement benefit costs included a regulatory asset component of $16 million at the same time. NEE's significantly larger prepaid amount suggests a more overfunded pension position compared to SO, which still has unamortized regulatory assets tied to postretirement benefits. This indicates that NEE may be in a stronger position to meet its pension obligations without requiring future contributions, whereas SO continues to manage legacy pension liabilities that remain subject to amortization.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From NEE's 10-K, extract the 'Prepaid pension benefit costs at NEE at December 31' of $2,496 million for 2024.",
        "Step 2: From SO's 10-K, extract the regulatory asset of $16 million associated with unamortized amounts in Southern Company Gas' other postretirement benefit plans at December 31, 2024.",
        "Step 3: Compare the two figures to infer differences in pension funding strategies\u2014NEE shows a large prepaid (overfunded) status, while SO still holds unamortized liabilities.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize the implications: NEE's position indicates stronger pension funding, while SO continues to manage underfunded legacy plans requiring amortization."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## FPL Electric Rate Regulation\n\nThe FPSC sets rates at a level that is intended to allow the utility the opportunity to collect from retail customers total revenues (revenue requirements) equal to its cost  of  prov iding  serv ice,  including  a  reasonable  rate  of  return  on  inv ested  capital.  T o  accomplish  this,  the  FPSC  uses  v arious  ratemaking  mechanisms, including, among other things, base rates and cost recovery clauses.\n\nBase Rates . In general, the basic costs of providing electric service, other than fuel and certain other costs, are recovered through base rates, which are designed to recover the costs of constructing, operating and maintaining the utility system. These basic costs include O&amp;M  expenses, depreciation and taxes, as well as a return on investment in assets used and useful in providing electric service (rate base). A t the time base rates are established, the allowed rate of return on rate base approximates the FPSC's determination of the utility's estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which includes its costs for outstanding debt and an allowed return on common equity . The FPSC monitors the utility's actual regulatory ROE through a surveillance report that is filed monthly with the FPSC. The FPSC does not provide assurance that any regulatory ROE will be achieved. Base rates are determined in rate proceedings or through negotiated settlements of those proceedings. Proceedings can occur at the initiative of the utility or upon action by the FPSC. Existing base rates remain in effect until new base rates are approved by the FPSC.\n\nBase Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025 - In December 2021, the FPSC issued a final order approving a stipulation and settlement between FPL and several intervenors in FPL's base rate proceeding (2021 rate agreement).\n\nKey elements of the 2021 rate agreement, which is effective from January 2022 through December 2025, include, among other things, the following:\n\n- New retail base rates and charges were established resulting in the following increases in annualized retail base revenues:\n- $692 million beginning January 1, 2022, and\n- $560 million beginning January 1, 2023.\n- In addition, FPL received base rate increases associated with the addition of up to 894 M W annually of new solar generation through the SoBRA  mechanism in each of 2024 and 2025. FPL's recovery through the SoBRA mechanism was limited to an installed cost cap of $1,250 per kW.\n- FPL's authorized regulatory ROE was 10.60%, with a range of 9.70% to 11.70%. However, in the event the average 30-year U.S. Treasury rate was 2.49% or greater over a consecutive six-month period, FPL was authorized to increase the regulatory ROE to 10.80% with a range of 9.80% to 11.80%. During A ugust 2022, this provision was triggered and effective September 1, 2022, FPL's authorized regulatory ROE and ROE range were increased. If FPL's earned regulatory ROE falls below 9.80%, FPL may seek retail base rate relief. If the earned regulatory ROE rises above 11.80%, any party with standing may seek a review of FPL's retail base rates.\n- Subject to certain conditions, FPL may amortize, over the term of the 2021 rate agreement, up to $1.45 billion of depreciation reserve surplus, provided that in any year of the 2021 rate agreement FPL must amortize at least enough reserve amount to maintain its minimum authorized regulatory ROE and also may not amortize any reserve amount that would result in an earned regulatory ROE in excess of its maximum authorized regulatory ROE.\n- FPL is authorized to expand SolarTogether  by constructing an additional 1,788 M W of solar generation from 2022 through 2025, such that the total capacity of SolarTogether  would be 3,278 M W. \u00ae \u00ae\n- Future storm restoration costs would be recoverable on an interim basis beginning 60 days from the filing of a cost recovery petition, but capped at an amount that produces a surcharge of no more than $4 for every 1,000 kWh of usage on residential bills during the first 12 months of cost recovery . A ny additional costs would be eligible for recovery in subsequent years. If storm restoration costs exceed $800 million in any given calendar year, FPL may request an increase to the $4 surcharge. See Note 1 - Storm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery.\n- If federal or state permanent corporate income tax changes become effective during the term of the 2021 rate agreement, FPL will prospectively adjust base rates after a review by the FPSC.\n\nIn M arch 2024, the FPSC issued a supplemental final order regarding FPL's 2021 rate agreement. The order affirmed the FPSC's prior approval of the 2021 rate agreement and is intended to further document, as requested by the Florida Supreme Court, how the evidence presented led to and supports the FPSC's decision to approve FPL's 2021 rate agreement. An April 2024 appeal of the order filed with the Florida Supreme Court by certain intervenors remains pending.\n\nFPL 2025 Base Rate Proceeding - On December 30, 2024, FPL filed a formal notification with the FPSC indicating its intent to initiate a base rate proceeding by submitting a four-year rate plan that would begin in January 2026 replacing the 2021 rate agreement. The notification states that, based on preliminary estimates, FPL expects to request a general base revenue requirement increase of approximately $1.55 billion effective January 2026 and a subsequent increase of approximately $930 million effective January 2027. The plan is also expected to request authority for a Solar and Battery Base Rate A djustment mechanism to recover, subject to FPSC review, the revenue requirements associated with building and operating additional solar and battery storage projects in 2028 and 2029. In addition, FPL expects to propose an allowed regulatory ROE midpoint of 11.90% and to incorporate the continued application of FPL's longstanding equity ratio approved in prior base rate cases. FPL expects to file its formal request to initiate a base rate proceeding on or around February 28, 2025.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nand the State of Georgia enacted the Georgia Nuclear Energy Financing Act, which allowed Georgia Power to recover financing costs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Financing costs were recovered on all applicable certified costs through annual adjustments to the NCCR tariff up to the certified capital cost of $4.418 billion. Financing costs related to capital costs above $4.418 billion up to $7.562 billion approved for recovery as described below were recognized through AFUDC and are being recovered through retail rates over the life of Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4; however, G eorgia Power did not record AFUDC related to any capital costs in excess of $7.562 billion. In 2022, the G eorgia PSC approved Georgia Power's filing to increase the NCCR tariff by $36 million annually, effective January 1, 2023. In November 2023, Georgia Power filed a request to continue for 2024 the NCCR tariff that was effective during 2023. The staff of the Georgia PSC accepted the proposal and no further approval from the Georgia PSC was required. See additional information below on AFUDC and the NCCR tariff following commercial operation of Unit 4.\n\nIn 2021, the Georgia PSC approved an order under which Georgia Power would include in rate base an allocation of $2.1 billion to Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and the Common Facilities from the $3.6 billion of Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4 costs previously deemed prudent by the Georgia PSC and would recover the related depreciation through retail base rates effective the month after Unit 3 is placed in service. In compliance with the G eorgia PSC order, G eorgia Power increased annual retail base rates by $318 million effective August 1, 2023 based on the in-service date of July 31, 2023 for Unit 3. The related increase in annual retail base rates included recovery of all projected operations and maintenance expenses for Unit 3 and the Common Facilities and other related costs of operation, partially offset by the related PTCs. Financing costs (debt and equity) on the remaining portion of the total Unit 3 and the Common Facilities construction costs continued to be recovered through the NCCR tariff or deferred. Georgia Power deferred as a regulatory asset the debt component of financing costs as well as the remaining depreciation until Unit 4 costs were placed in retail base rates as described below. The regulatory assets for the debt component of financing costs and depreciation are being recovered over 10 years beginning May 2024, as approved by the Georgia PSC, with a remaining balance of $23 million and $29 million, respectively, at December 31, 2024. The equity component of financing costs ($39 million at December 31, 2024) represents an unrecognized ratemaking amount that is not reflected on Georgia Power's balance sheets. This amount will be recognized in Georgia Power's income statements in the periods it is billable to customers.\n\nIn December 2023, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's application to adjust rates to include reasonable and prudent Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 costs as modified by the related stipulation (Prudency Stipulation) among Georgia Power, the staff of the Georgia PSC, and certain intervenors.\n\nUnder the terms of the approved Prudency Stipulation, Georgia Power will recover $7.562 billion in total construction and capital costs and associated retail rate base items of $1.02 billion, which includes AFUDC financing costs above $4.418 billion (the Georgia PSC-certified amount) up to $7.562 billion. Georgia Power will also recover projected operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation, nuclear decommissioning accruals, and property taxes, net of projected PTCs. After considering construction and capital costs already in retail base rates of $2.1 billion and $362 million of associated retail rate base items for Unit 3 and Common Facilities (approved by the Georgia PSC in 2021), Georgia Power included in retail rate base the remaining $5.462 billion of construction and capital costs as well as $647 million of associated retail rate base items effective with the April 29, 2024 in-service date for Unit 4. Annual retail base revenues increased approx imately $730 million and the average retail base rates were adjusted by approximately 5% (net of the elimination of the NCCR tariff described below) effective May 1, 2024.\n\nReductions to the ROE used to calculate the NCCR tariff (pursuant to prior Georgia PSC orders) negatively impacted earnings by approximately $80 million through the second quarter 2024 and $310 million and $300 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Further, as included in the approved Prudency Stipulation, since commercial operation for Unit 4 was not achieved by March 31, 2024, Georgia Power's ROE used to determine the NCCR tariff and calculate AFUDC was reduced to zero effective April 1, 2024, which resulted in a negative impact to earnings of approximately $10 million (for one month) in the second quarter 2024 based on the April 29, 2024 inservice date. Effective May 1, 2024, following commercial operation of Unit 4, Georgia Power's NCCR tariff was eliminated and financing costs are included in Georgia Power's general retail revenue requirements. Financing costs of $10 million that were not recovered through the NCCR tariff will be addressed in Georgia Power's next retail base rate case proceeding.\n\nAs of each Unit's respective first refueling outage, if the respective Unit's performance has materially deviated from ex pected performance, the Georgia PSC may order Georgia Power to credit customers for operations and maintenance expenses or disallow costs associated with the repair or replacement of any system, structure, or component found to have caused the material deviation in performance if proven to be the result of imprudent engineering, construction, procurement, testing, or start-up. Unit 3 demonstrated high performance and reliability during the first 14 months of operation leading up to its first refueling outage, which took place in the fall of 2024 and no performance-related disallowance is expected. Unit 4 has also demonstrated high performance and reliability since being placed in service and its first refueling outage is projected to begin in the fall of 2025. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.",

The Southern Company system had over 11,600 MW of renewable and storage facilities through ownership and long-term PPAs. This means NEE\u2019s renewable capacity is more than double that of SO. This difference reflects NEE's strategic focus on owning and operating contracted renewable assets across the U.S., particularly in Texas and the West and Midwest regions, while SO has been transitioning its energy mix from coal to natural gas and renewables, retiring over 6,700 MW of coal-fired capacity since 2010 and converting 3,700 MW to natural gas since 2015.",

      "question": "How do the differences in treatment of unrecognized amounts in prepaid pension benefit costs between NextEra Energy (NEE) and Southern Company (SO) reflect distinct regulatory asset reporting practices in their 2023 financial disclosures?",
      "answer": "NextEra Energy (NEE) discloses that unrecognized amounts in prepaid pension benefit costs are included in regulatory assets (liabilities), indicating that these costs are subject to future recognition in financial statements as regulatory decisions allow. In contrast, Southern Company (SO) specifically notes that its prepaid pension costs exclude $24 million and $32 million in regulatory assets at the end of 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to unamortized amounts from Southern Company Gas' postretirement benefit plans prior to its acquisition. This shows that while both companies report prepaid pension costs, Southern Company explicitly excludes certain regulatory assets from these figures, reflecting a more segmented approach to regulatory asset reporting post-acquisition. As a result, the two companies apply different reporting treatments for regulatory components tied to prepaid pension benefit costs, with SO maintaining a more detailed exclusion of regulatory assets.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize: While NEE includes unrecognized pension cost components in regulatory assets, SO explicitly excludes certain regulatory assets from its prepaid pension costs, particularly those tied to a prior acquisition. This reflects differing regulatory asset reporting practices for the same type of financial cost."

Southern Company Gas highlights that regulatory recovery is not guaranteed and depends on decisions by the Commissions, which may disallow certain costs or require refunds.

Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the applicable regulated utility subsidiary's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, its investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While Southern Company Gas' regulated utility subsidiaries expect to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment.\n\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant or plant under construction, and/or (3) a refund to customers. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and significant auditor judgment to evaluate management estimates and the subjectivity of audit evidence.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.\n- We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for Southern Company Gas' regulated utility subsidiaries in Georgia, Illinois, Tennessee, and Virginia, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management's recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.\n- For regulatory matters in process, we inspected filings with the Commissions by the regulated utility subsidiaries and other interested parties that may impact the regulated utility subsidiaries' future rates for any evidence that might contradict management's assertions.\n- We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital projects. We tested selected costs included in the capitalized project costs for completeness and accuracy.\n- We obtained representation from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in rates.\n- We evaluated Southern Company Gas' disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.\n\n/s/ Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP Atlanta, Georgia February 16, 2022\n\nWe have served as Southern Company Gas' auditor since 2016.\n\nII-118",

Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the applicable regulated utility subsidiary's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, its investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While Southern Company Gas' regulated utility subsidiaries expect to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment.\n\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant or plant under construction, and/or (3) a refund to customers. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and significant auditor judgment to evaluate management estimates and the subjectivity of audit evidence.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.\n- We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for Southern Company Gas' regulated utility subsidiaries in Georgia, Illinois, Tennessee, and Virginia, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management's recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.\n- For regulatory matters in process, we inspected filings with the Commissions by the regulated utility subsidiaries and other interested parties that may impact the regulated utility subsidiaries' future rates for any evidence that might contradict management's assertions.\n- We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital projects. We tested selected costs included in the capitalized project costs for completeness and accuracy.\n- We obtained representation from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in rates.\n- We evaluated Southern Company Gas' disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.\n\n/s/ Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP Atlanta, Georgia February 16, 2022\n\nWe have served as Southern Company Gas' auditor since 2016.\n\nII-118",

DUK\u2019s total current assets in 2021 were $3,006 million, and SO\u2019s were $505 million.

      "answer": "In both audits, Deloitte & Touche LLP evaluated the recoverability of regulatory asset balances by inquiring about changes in regulatory orders and comparing recorded balances to independently developed expectations. At Duke Energy (DUK), auditors performed trend analyses and obtained management representations asserting the probability of recovery. For Southern Company Gas (SO), auditors extended these procedures by reading regulatory orders from multiple states (Georgia, Illinois, Tennessee, and Virginia), inspecting regulatory filings for intervenor challenges, and testing the completeness and accuracy of capitalized project costs. The regulatory uncertainties evaluated for SO included the risk that the Commissions might not approve full recovery of incurred costs or invested capital, and potential future rate reductions or refunds, which could significantly impact financial recoverability.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - DUK audit procedures included trend analyses, comparison to independently developed expectations, and management representations on recovery probability.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - SO audit procedures included reading regulatory orders, inspecting filings for intervenor challenges, testing capitalized costs, and evaluating the risk of non-recovery of costs or future rate reductions.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies had similar core audit procedures for regulatory asset balances, but SO's audit included deeper regulatory scrutiny due to multi-state jurisdictional complexities and specific risks around intervenor challenges and potential disallowances."

          "chunk_text": "property, plant, and equipment; other regulatory assets; other regulatory liabilities; other cost of removal obligations; deferred charges and credits related to income taxes; operating revenues; other operations and maintenance expenses; and depreciation and amortization.\n\nThe Commissions set the rates the regulated utility subsidiaries are permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the applicable regulated utility subsidiary's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, its investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While Southern Company Gas' regulated utility subsidiaries expect to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment.\n\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant or plant under construction, and/or (3) a refund to customers. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and significant auditor judgment to evaluate management estimates and the subjectivity of audit evidence.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.\n- We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for Southern Company Gas' regulated utility subsidiaries in Georgia, Illinois, Tennessee, and Virginia, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management's recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.\n- For regulatory matters in process, we inspected filings with the Commissions by the regulated utility subsidiaries and other interested parties that may impact the regulated utility subsidiaries' future rates for any evidence that might contradict management's assertions.\n- We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital projects. We tested selected costs included in the capitalized project costs for completeness and accuracy.\n- We obtained representation from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in rates.\n- We evaluated Southern Company Gas' disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.\n\n/s/ Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP Atlanta, Georgia February 16, 2022\n\nWe have served as Southern Company Gas' auditor since 2016.\n\nII-118",

      "answer": "Duke Energy reports $91 million in Noncurrent Derivative Assets, while NextEra Energy reports $1,790 million for the same metric. This substantial difference indicates that NextEra Energy maintains a much larger portfolio of long-term derivative instruments, which are typically used to hedge against market risks such as commodity price fluctuations and interest rate changes. In contrast, Duke Energy\u2019s smaller position suggests a more conservative or limited use of such instruments for long-term risk mitigation. While neither company explicitly states its risk management philosophy in these terms, the disparity in scale implies that NextEra Energy may be taking a more expansive approach to managing long-term financial exposures through derivatives.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy paid $202 million in cash for interest, net of amount capitalized, while NextEra Energy paid $2,463 million for the same metric. This significant difference highlights contrasting capital structures: Duke Energy's relatively modest interest payment suggests a smaller debt load or lower interest rates on its borrowings, whereas NextEra's much higher payment reflects its substantially larger debt financing. Both companies operate in the capital-intensive utilities sector, where debt financing is common for infrastructure investments, but the tenfold difference in their interest payments underscores distinct approaches to leveraging their balance sheets.",

      "question": "What is the total amount of noncurrent regulatory assets reported by DUK and NEE as of December 31, 2023, and how do their filings specifically describe the treatment of these assets in terms of future revenue recovery or refunds?",
      "answer": "As of December 31, 2023, Duke Energy (DUK) reported $3,916 million in noncurrent regulatory assets, while NextEra Energy (NEE) included its noncurrent regulatory assets within its regulatory accounting disclosures, specifically noting $1,021 million related to interim removal costs and $14 million related to other generation plant dismantlement costs. DUK\u2019s noncurrent regulatory assets represent costs that are expected to be recovered from customers through future rates. NEE\u2019s filing clarifies that regulatory assets represent probable future revenues that will be recovered from or refunded to customers through the ratemaking process, and they are included in rate base or earn a return during the recovery period.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From DUK\u2019s filing, extract the total noncurrent regulatory assets as $3,916 million as of December 31, 2023.",
        "Step 2: From NEE\u2019s filing, identify the specific amounts of $1,021 million for interim removal costs and $14 million for other generation plant dismantlement costs included in noncurrent regulatory assets.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize how both companies describe the treatment of these assets: DUK indicates these assets are recoverable through future rates, while NEE states they represent probable future revenues or refunds through the ratemaking process.",
        "Step 4: Conclude that both companies treat noncurrent regulatory assets as part of their regulated cost recovery mechanisms, though the specific amounts and categories differ."

      "answer": "Southern Company reported that ITC amortization had an impact of -1.3% on its effective income tax rate in 2023. Duke Energy disclosed ITC amortization as a component of its deferred income tax expenses, but did not specify a percentage impact. To calculate the combined impact, we rely on Southern Company's disclosed value since Duke Energy did not provide a specific percentage. Therefore, the combined impact of ITC amortization on the effective income tax rate is -1.3% for Southern Company, while Duke Energy\u2019s specific impact remains unquantifiable based on the provided data.",

      "question": "How did the change in natural gas costs for DUK and Southern Company Gas in 2023 compared to 2022 affect their respective operating income?",
      "answer": "DUK experienced a $98 million decrease in the cost of natural gas in 2023 compared to 2022, which directly contributed to a reduction in total operating expenses ($1,983 million in 2023 vs. $2,124 million in 2022). This cost reduction, along with other expense decreases, helped increase DUK's operating income from $391 million in 2022 to $525 million in 2023, a $134 million improvement. In contrast, Southern Company Gas passes all prudently-incurred natural gas costs directly to customers through regulated cost recovery mechanisms without markup, and defers or accrues any differences between actual costs and commodity revenue. As a result, changes in natural gas costs do not directly impact Southern Company Gas' operating income, since no operating income is recognized related to these costs. Instead, any cost variances are billed or refunded to customers prospectively through adjustments to the commodity rate.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - DUK's cost of natural gas decreased by $98 million from $261 million in 2022 to $163 million in 2023, contributing to a $141 million decrease in total operating expenses.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source A - DUK's operating income increased from $391 million in 2022 to $525 million in 2023, a $134 million improvement directly influenced by lower operating expenses.",
        "Step 3: Extract from source B - Southern Company Gas uses natural gas cost recovery mechanisms where all prudently-incurred costs are passed through to customers without markup, and any differences between actual costs and revenue are deferred or accrued and later billed or refunded.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - While DUK's lower natural gas costs directly improved its operating income, Southern Company Gas' cost structure is designed so that natural gas cost fluctuations do not affect its operating income due to the pass-through nature of these expenses."

Duke Energy's cost of natural gas decreased by $683 million (from $1,276 million in 2022 to $593 million in 2023), while Southern Company's cost of natural gas decreased by $1,360 million (from $2,994 million in 2022 to $1,644 million in 2023).",

      "answer": "Duke Energy recovered $1.5 billion in deferred fuel costs in 2023, while Southern Company had a $50 million retail fuel cost under recovery in 2023. Combined, this totals $1.55 billion. This reflects that Duke Energy was actively collecting previously deferred fuel balances, whereas Southern Company was still experiencing a net under recovery, indicating differing regulatory mechanisms and timing of cost recovery between the two utilities.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Duke Energy recovered $1.5 billion of deferred fuel costs in 2023.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Southern Company had a retail fuel cost under recovery of $50 million in 2023.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Combine both figures to show the total fuel cost recovery position of both companies, and interpret the difference in financial treatment as a reflection of their respective regulatory environments and cost recovery mechanisms."

      "answer": "Duke Energy's cost of natural gas decreased by $98 million from 2022 ($261 million) to 2023 ($163 million). Southern Company Gas recovers all prudently-incurred natural gas costs directly from utility customers through regulatory mechanisms without markup, deferring or accruing differences between actual costs and revenue earned to be billed or refunded prospectively. This aligns with Duke\u2019s cost pass-through approach, where the cost of natural gas is passed on to customers, though Duke's financial reporting explicitly shows the cost line item fluctuation year-over-year.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - DUK's cost of natural gas was $261 million in 2022 and $163 million in 2023, indicating a $98 million decrease.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - SO's natural gas costs for utility customers are passed through without markup under regulatory recovery mechanisms, with differences deferred or accrued and later billed or refunded.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies reflect cost of natural gas as a pass-through expense, but DUK's financial statements explicitly show the year-over-year cost fluctuation, while SO emphasizes regulatory deferral mechanisms."

      "question": "What was the combined decrease in natural gas costs for Duke Energy (DUK) and Southern Company (SO) from 2022 to 2023, and how did this decrease contribute to changes in their respective operating expenses, based on the specific financial data disclosed in their 10-K filings?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy's cost of natural gas decreased by $98 million (from $261 million in 2022 to $163 million in 2023), and Southern Company's cost of natural gas decreased by $1,360 million in 2023 compared to 2022. Together, this represents a combined decrease of $1,458 million. For Duke Energy, this reduction in natural gas costs contributed to a broader decline in total operating expenses, which fell from $2,124 million in 2022 to $1,983 million in 2023, although other expense categories, such as depreciation and property taxes, remained stable or increased. For Southern Company, the significant drop in natural gas costs was a major factor in the $1,385 million decrease in total operating expenses, despite increases in other categories like depreciation and other operations and maintenance. Both companies operate under regulated utility frameworks, which may influence how fuel cost savings translate into operating expense changes due to cost recovery mechanisms.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract DUK's cost of natural gas for 2022 ($261M) and 2023 ($163M) to calculate the decrease of $98M.",
        "Step 2: Extract SO's cost of natural gas change from 2022 to 2023, which was a decrease of $1,360M as stated directly in the table.",
        "Step 3: Sum the two decreases to determine the combined decrease of $1,458M.",
        "Step 4: Analyze DUK's total operating expenses, which decreased from $2,124M to $1,983M, showing alignment with the drop in natural gas costs, though other expenses remained flat or increased.",
        "Step 5: Analyze SO's total operating expenses, which dropped by $1,385M, closely matching the $1,360M decrease in natural gas costs, indicating a strong contribution from lower fuel costs despite increases in other expense categories.",
        "Step 6: Recognize that both companies are regulated utilities, so the relationship between fuel cost changes and operating expense changes may be influenced by regulatory cost recovery mechanisms."

In 2021, NEER added approximately 2,008 MW of new wind generating capacity and 728  MW  of  solar  generating  capacity,  repowered  435  MW  of  wind  generating  capacity  and  increased  its  backlog  of  contracted  renewable development projects.\n\nCorporate and Other's results in 2021 increased primarily due to favorable non-qualifying hedge activity.\n\nNEE and its subsidiaries require funds to support and grow their businesses. These funds are primarily provided by cash flows from operations, borrowings or issuances of short- and long-term debt, proceeds from differential membership investors, sales of assets to NEP or third parties and, from time to time, issuances of equity securities. See Liquidity and Capital Resources - Liquidity.\n\n## RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nNet income attributable to NEE for 2021 was $3.57 billion compared to $2.92 billion in 2020. In 2021, net income attributable to NEE increased primarily due to higher results at the FPL segment, Corporate and Other, NEER and Gulf Power. The comparison of the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are included in Management's Discussion in NEE's and FPL's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\nIn February 2020, a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources completed the sale of its ownership interest in two solar generation facilities located in Spain with a total generating capacity of 99.8 MW. In December 2020, a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources sold a 90% noncontrolling ownership interest in a portfolio of three wind generation facilities and four solar generation facilities representing a total net generating capacity of  900  MW. Additionally  in  December 2020, a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources sold its 100% ownership interest in a 100 MW solar generation  facility  and  a  30  MW  battery  storage  facility  under  construction,  which  achieved  commercial  operations  in  June  2021,  to  a  NEP subsidiary. In October 2021, subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources completed the sale to a NEP subsidiary of their 100% ownership interests in three wind generation facilities and one solar generation facility with a total generating capacity of 467 MW and 33.3% of the noncontrolling ownership interests in four solar generation facilities and multiple distributed generation solar facilities representing a total net generating capacity of  122  MW.  In  December  2021,  subsidiaries  of  NextEra  Energy  Resources  sold  their  100%  ownership  interest  in  a  portfolio  of  seven  wind generation  facilities  and  six  solar  generation  facilities  representing  a  total  generating  capacity  of  2,520  MW  and  115  MW  of  battery  storage capacity,  three  of  which  are  currently  under  construction  with  expected  in-service  dates  in  the  first  half  of  2022.  See  Note  1  -  Disposal  of Businesses/Assets and Sale of Noncontrolling Ownership Interests.\n\nIn  March  2021,  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  NEET  acquired  GridLiance  Holdco,  LP  and  GridLiance  GP,  LLC  (GridLiance),  which  owns  and operates three FERC-regulated transmission utilities across six states, five in the Midwest and Nevada. See Note 6 - GridLiance.\n\nNEE's effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were approximately 11% and 2%, respectively. The rates for both years reflect the impact of PTCs and ITCs and, in 2020, also reflect the impact of lower pretax income and the gain on sale of the Spain solar projects which was not taxable for federal nor state income tax purposes. See Note 5.\n\nOn January  1,  2021,  FPL  and  Gulf  Power  Company  merged,  with  FPL  as  the  surviving  entity.  However,  during  2021,  FPL  continued  to  be regulated as two separate ratemaking entities in the former service areas of FPL and Gulf Power. The FPL segment and Gulf Power continued to be separate operating segments of NEE, as well as FPL, through 2021. See Note 6 - Merger of FPL and Gulf Power Company. Effective January 1, 2022, FPL became regulated as one ratemaking entity with new unified rates and tariffs, and also became one operating segment of NEE. See Item 1.

      "answer": "NextEra Energy Resources divested 2,987 MW of generating capacity in 2021 to NextEra Energy Partners, including a portfolio of wind and solar facilities, as part of a strategic move to monetize mature assets and reinvest in new renewable projects. In contrast, Gulf Power maintains a 50% undivided ownership interest in Plant Daniel alongside Mississippi Power, where Mississippi Power operates the facility on Gulf Power's behalf under an agreement. This reflects two distinct utility strategies: NextEra Energy Resources actively recycling capital through asset sales to fund new development, while Gulf Power retains long-term joint ownership in major generation facilities with operational responsibilities delegated to a partner.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize the two strategies \u2014 NEEER is actively divesting assets to NEP to fund new investments, whereas Gulf Power maintains shared ownership and relies on a partner for plant operation."

In 2021, net income attributable to NEE increased primarily due to higher results at the FPL segment, Corporate and Other, NEER and Gulf Power. The comparison of the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are included in Management's Discussion in NEE's and FPL's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\nIn February 2020, a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources completed the sale of its ownership interest in two solar generation facilities located in Spain with a total generating capacity of 99.8 MW.
