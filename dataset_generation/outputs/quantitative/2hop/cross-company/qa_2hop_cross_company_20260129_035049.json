      "question": "How does the use of estimated total contract costs in revenue recognition for long-term contracts differ between GD and HON, particularly in terms of the factors influencing these estimates and the financial implications of estimation adjustments?",
      "answer": "GD uses a cost-to-cost input method to estimate progress on long-term contracts and recognizes revenue over time. It bases its estimates on assumptions such as labor productivity, material costs, subcontractor performance, and availability of funding. If there is a significant change in these estimates, GD adjusts the profit using a cumulative catch-up method, which impacts profit recorded to date and future revenue recognition. In 2023, GD had $93.6 billion in remaining performance obligations, with 40% expected to be recognized in 2024. HON also uses the cost-to-cost method for long-term contracts and recognizes revenue over time, but its estimation process includes factors like historical performance trends, inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, and anticipated labor agreements. HON emphasizes auditor evaluation of these estimates due to their complexity and subjectivity, particularly for contracts with longer durations or significant gross margin changes. Both companies face financial implications from estimation changes, but GD explicitly ties adjustments to a defined catch-up method, while HON focuses on audit validation of estimates.",

      "question": "How do the differences in the treatment of unbilled receivables (contract assets) between GD's defense and aerospace segments compare to HON's general approach in tracking progress on performance obligations, particularly in terms of the impact on cash collections?",
      "answer": "GD distinguishes between its defense and aerospace segments in how it manages cash collections and contract assets. In the defense segments, billing typically occurs after revenue recognition, resulting in contract assets, while in the Aerospace segment, GD generally receives deposits upon contract execution or milestone achievement, which are liquidated as revenue is recognized. In contrast, HON systematically tracks unbilled receivables (contract assets) and billed receivables on a contract-by-contract basis, recognizing contract assets when revenue is recognized before billing and derecognizing them upon billing. This shows that while GD's approach varies by business segment, HON maintains a more standardized process for tracking and derecognizing contract assets as performance obligations are satisfied.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from GD's 10-K - 'In our defense segments, amounts are billed as work progresses... billing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition, resulting in contract assets' and 'In our Aerospace segment, we generally receive deposits from customers upon contract execution... liquidated when revenue is recognized.'",
        "Step 2: Extract from HON's 10-K - 'Unbilled receivables arise when the timing of cash collected from customers differs from the timing of revenue recognition' and 'Contract assets are recognized when the revenue associated with the contract is recognized prior to billing and derecognized when billed.'",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - GD's defense contracts lead to contract assets due to post-revenue billing, while aerospace contracts involve upfront deposits. HON, on the other hand, focuses on tracking unbilled receivables systematically, recognizing them when revenue precedes billing. This comparison highlights differing operational strategies in managing cash collections and contract assets."

The expected benefit payments for our other postretirement benefits include payments for prescription drug benefits. The above table also includes Medicare Part D subsidy amounts expected to be received by the company which will offset other postretirement benefit payments.\n\n## D. Plan assets\n\nIn general, our strategy for both the U.S. and non-U.S. pensions is designed to decrease funded status volatility through ongoing alignment of the interest rate sensitivity of our investments to our obligations, while reducing risk from return seeking assets in our portfolio. The current U.S. pension target asset allocation is 85 percent fix ed income and 15 percent equities. We will revise this target allocation periodically to ensure it reflects our overall objectives. The non-U.S. pension weighted-average target allocations are 59 percent fixed income, 19 percent insurance contracts, 11 percent equities, 6 percent real estate, and 5 percent other.  The target allocations for each plan vary based upon local statutory requirements, demographics of plan participants and funded status.  We primarily invest the non-U.S. plan assets in non-U.S. securities.\n\nOur target allocation for the other postretirement benefit plans is 40 percent equities and 60 percent fix ed income.\n\nWe rebalance the U.S. plans to within the appropriate target asset allocation ranges on a monthly basis.  The frequency of rebalancing for the non-U.S. plans varies depending on the plan. As a result of our diversification strategies, there are no significant concentrations of risk within the portfolio of investments.\n\nWe permit the use of certain derivative instruments where appropriate and necessary for achieving overall investment policy objectives.  The plans do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes.\n\nThe accounting guidance on fair value measurements specifies a fair value hierarchy based upon the observability of inputs used in valuation techniques (Level 1, 2 and 3). Certain assets that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical ex pedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. See Note 18 for a discussion of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nWe determine fair values as follows:\n\n- Equity securities are primarily based on valuations for identical instruments in active markets.",

We determine the product warranty liability by applying historical claim rate ex perience to the current field population and dealer inventory.  G enerally, we base historical claim rates on actual warranty ex perience for each product by machine model/engine size by customer or dealer location (inside or outside North America).  We develop specific rates for each product shipment month and update them monthly based on actual warranty claim experience.  Warranty costs may differ from those estimated if actual claim rates are higher or lower than our historical rates.\n\nProduct liability and insurance loss reserve - We determine these reserves based upon reported claims in process of settlement and actuarial estimates for losses incurred but not reported. Loss reserves, including incurred but not reported reserves, are based on estimates, and ultimate settlements may vary significantly from such estimates due to increased claims frequency or severity over historical levels. The amount of these reserves totaled $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The majority of the balance in both 2024 and 2023 consisted of unearned insurance premiums.\n\nPostretirement benefits -  We  sponsor  defined  benefit  pension  plans  and/or  other  postretirement  benefit  plans  (retirement  healthcare  and  life  insurance)  to employees in many of our locations throughout the world. There are assumptions used in the accounting for these defined benefit plans that include discount rate, expected return on plan assets, expected rate of compensation increase, the future health care trend rate, mortality and other economic and demographic assumptions. The  actuarial  assumptions  we  use  may  change  or  differ  significantly  from  actual  results,  which  may  result  in  a  material  impact  to  our  consolidated  financial statements.\n\nThe effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions are considered actuarial gains or losses. We utilize a mark-tomarket approach in recognizing actuarial gains or losses immediately through earnings upon the annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement.\n\nPrimary actuarial assumptions were determined as follows:\n\n- We use the assumed discount rate to discount future benefit obligations back to today's dollars.  The U.S. discount rate is based on a benefit cash flowmatching approach and represents the rate at which our benefit obligations could effectively be settled as of our measurement date, December 31. The benefit cash flow-matching approach involves analyzing Caterpillar's projected cash flows against a high quality bond yield curve, calculated using a wide population of corporate Aa bonds available on the measurement date. We use a similar approach to determine the assumed discount rate for our most significant  non-U.S.  plans. In estimating the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost, we utilize a full yield curve approach in determining a discount rate. This approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. Discount rates are sensitive to changes in interest rates.\n- The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on our estimate of long-term returns for equities and fixed income securities weighted by the allocation of our plan assets. This rate is impacted by changes in general market conditions, but because it represents a long-term rate, it is not significantly impacted  by  short-term  market  swings. Changes in our allocation of plan assets would also impact this rate. For example, a shift to more fixed income securities would lower the rate. The expected return on plan assets is based on the fair value of plan asset allocations as of our measurement date, December 31.\n- We use the expected rate of compensation increase to develop benefit obligations using projected pay at retirement. It represents average long-term salary increases. This rate is influenced by our long-term compensation policies.\n- The assumed health care trend rate represents the rate at which health care costs are assumed to increase and is based on historical and expected experience. Changes in our projections of future health care costs due to general economic conditions and those specific to health care (e.g., technology driven cost changes) will impact this trend rate.\n- We use the mortality assumption to estimate the life expectancy of plan participants.",

During the third quarter of 2020, the Company paid the outstanding balances and closed these credit facilities.\n\nThe Company also had an additional $266 million in stand-alone letters of credit and bank guarantees issued and outstanding at December 31, 2021. These instruments are utilized in connection with normal business activities.\n\n## Long-Term Debt Issuances and Fixed-to-Floating Interest Rate Swaps\n\nThe principal amounts, interest rates and maturity dates of individual long-term debt issuances can be found in the long-term debt table found at the beginning of this note.\n\nDuring the second and third quarters of 2021, 3M entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $800 million. These swaps converted $500 million and $300 million of 3M's $1.0 billion and $650 million principal amount of fixed rate notes due 2049 and 2050, respectively, into floating rate debt for the portion of their terms through mid-2028 with an interest rate based on a three-month LIBOR index.\n\nIn March 2020, 3M issued $1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed rate registered notes. These were comprised of $500 million of 5-year notes due 2025 with a coupon rate of 2.65%, $600 million of 10-year notes due 2030 with a coupon rate of 3.05%, and $650 million of 30-year notes due 2050 with a coupon rate of 3.70%.\n\nIn February 2019, 3M issued $2.25 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed rate medium-term notes. These were comprised of $450 million of 3-year notes due 2022 with a coupon rate of 2.75%, $500 million of remaining 5-year notes due 2024 with a coupon rate of 3.25%, $800 million of 10-year notes due 2029 with a coupon rate of 3.375%, and $500 million of remaining 29.5year notes due 2048 with a coupon rate of 4.00%. Issuances of the 5-year and 29.5-year notes were pursuant to a reopening of existing securities issued in September 2018.\n\nIn August 2019, 3M issued $3.25 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed rate registered notes. These were comprised of $500 million of 3.5-year notes due 2023 with a coupon rate of 1.75%, $750 million of 5.5-year notes due 2025 with a coupon rate of 2.00%, $1.0 billion of 10-year notes due 2029 with a coupon rate of 2.375%, and $1.0 billion of 30-year notes due 2049 with a coupon rate of 3.25%.\n\n## Long-Term Debt Maturities and Extinguishments\n\nIn November 2021, 3M repaid 600 million euros aggregate principal amount of Eurobonds that matured.\n\nIn March 2021, 3M, via a make-whole-call offer, redeemed $450 million principal amount of 2.75% notes due 2022. The Company recorded an early debt extinguishment pre-tax charge of approximately $11 million within interest expense. This charge reflected the differential between the carrying value and the amount paid to reacquire the notes and related expenses.\n\nIn December 2020, 3M, via make-whole-call offers, repaid $1 billion aggregate principal amount of its outstanding notes. This included $400 million aggregate principal amount of 3.00% notes and $600 million aggregate principal amount of 1.625% notes, both of which were due to mature in 2021. The Company recorded an early debt extinguishment pre-tax charge of approximately $10 million within interest expense. This charge reflected the differential between the carrying value and the amount paid to reacquire the notes and related expenses.\n\nIn May 2020, 3M repaid 650 million euros aggregate principal amount of floating-rate medium-term notes that matured. In August 2020, 3M repaid $500 aggregate principal amount of floating rate medium-term notes that matured.\n\nIn June 2019, 3M repaid $625 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate medium-term notes that matured.\n\nIn 2019, 3M also assumed approximately $2.6 billion of debt in connection with the acquisitions of Acelity and M*Modal (See Note 3) of which $2.1 billion was immediately redeemed or paid at close.\n\n## In-Substance Defeasance\n\nIn conjunction with the October 2019 acquisition of Acelity (see Note 3), 3M assumed outstanding debt of the business, of which $445 million in principal amount of third lien senior secured notes (Third Lien Notes) maturing in 2021 with a coupon rate of 12.5% was not immediately redeemed at closing. Instead, at closing, 3M satisfied and discharged the Third Lien Notes via an insubstance defeasance, whereby 3M transferred cash equivalents and marketable securities to a trust with irrevocable",

      "answer": "Boeing derived 86% of its revenue in 2021 from fixed-price contracts, which exposes it to cost overruns and estimation risks. Lockheed Martin explicitly states that fixed-price contracts, especially for complex development programs, increase financial risk because cost and timing are difficult to estimate, often leading to losses. Furthermore, Lockheed Martin notes that bidding on cost-reimbursable development work with follow-on fixed-price production options increases the risk of lower margins or losses because contractors must estimate production costs before development is complete. Given Boeing\u2019s heavy reliance on fixed-price contracts, this exposure significantly amplifies the financial risks Lockheed Martin describes, particularly in environments where cost estimation is inherently uncertain and inflationary pressures may further compress margins.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\ntechnical challenges, costs and timing of development programs are difficult to estimate and the use of fixed-price instead of costreimbursable contracts for such programs increases the financial risk to the contractor. This has resulted in losses on certain fixedprice  development  programs  and  could  result  in  additional  losses  in  the  future.  In  addition,  an  increased  number  of  contract solicitations require the contractor to bid upfront on cost-reimbursable development work and the follow-on fixed-price production options in one submission. This requirement increases the risk that we may experience lower margins than expected, or a loss, on the production options because we must estimate the cost of producing a product before it has been developed. These risks may cause us not to bid on certain future programs, which could adversely affect our future growth prospects and financial performance. See Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further  details  about  losses  incurred  on  certain  programs,  including  fixed-price  development  programs.  In  addition,  given  the customer's  emphasis  on  cost,  even  if  we  effectively  manage  program  life-cycle  and  sustainment  costs  and  meet  customer affordability targets, the customer may elect to recompete programs at the end of existing contracts, which may result in a lost business  opportunity  or  reduce  operating  margins.  From  time  to  time,  the  U.S.  Government  also  has  proposed  contract  terms, imposed internal policies, or taken positions that represent fundamental changes from historical practices or that we believe are inconsistent with the FAR or other laws and regulations and which could adversely affect our business.\n\nThe DoD is increasingly pursuing rapid acquisition pathways and procedures for new technologies, including through so called 'other  transaction  authority'  agreements  (OTAs).  While  OTAs  do  not  currently  represent  a  significant  portion  of  our  overall contracts (less than 2% of total backlog), in recent years the DoD has increased the frequency of use and the size of OTAs and we expect this trend to continue. OTAs are exempt from many traditional procurement laws, including the FAR, and may be used, subject  to  certain  conditions,  for  research,  prototype  development  and  follow-on  production  for  a  successful  prototype.  The conditions to award OTAs include, in certain instances, that a significant portion of the work under the OTA is performed by a nontraditional  defense  contractor  or  that  a  portion  of  the  cost  of  the  protype  project  is  funded  by  non-governmental  sources.  If  we cannot successfully adapt to the DoD's rapid acquisition processes or if the DoD significantly increases the use of OTAs with nontraditional  defense  contractors  or  increasingly  mandates  cost  sharing,  then  we  may  lose  strategic  new  business  opportunities  in high-growth areas and our future performance and results could be adversely affected. Our success also depends on our ability to continue  to  identify  technological  innovation  and  adapt  it  to  our  platforms  in  light  of  changes  in  procurement  policies  that emphasize acquiring technologies with shorter life cycles.\n\n## Our profitability and cash flow may vary based on the mix of our contracts and programs, our performance, and our ability to control costs.\n\nOur profitability and cash flow may vary materially depending on the types of government contracts undertaken, the nature of products produced or services performed under those contracts, the costs incurred in performing the work, the achievement of other performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees is determined, particularly under award and incentive-fee contracts. Failure to perform to customer expectations and contract requirements may result in reduced fees or losses and may adversely affect our financial performance. Our backlog includes a variety of contract types and represents the sales we expect to recognize for our products and services in the future. In addition, a significant portion of our contracts are classified by the  U.S.  Government,  which  impose  security  requirements  that  limit  our  ability  to  discuss  our  performance  on  these  contracts, including any specific risks, disputes and claims.\n\nContract types primarily include fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts. Under each type of contract, if we are unable to control  costs,  including  due  to  greater  than  anticipated  inflation  or  unexpected  delays,  our  operating  results  could  be  adversely affected, particularly if we are unable to demonstrate an increase in contract value to our customers. Cost overruns or the failure to perform on existing programs also may adversely affect our ability to retain existing programs and win future contract awards, or could cause the customer to terminate the contract for convenience. Given broader inflation in the economy, we are monitoring the risk inflation presents to active and future contracts. To date we have not seen broad based increases in costs from inflation that are material to the business as a whole; however, if we began to experience greater than expected supply chain and labor inflation our profits and margins under our contracts, in particular fixed price contracts, could be adversely affected.\n\nUnder fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform specified work for a pre-determined price. If our actual costs exceed our estimates our profits are reduced and we could incur a loss. Some fixed-price contracts have a performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance. For additional risks related to the DoD's current use of fixed-price contracts see the risk factor above. See Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details about losses incurred on certain fixed-price programs to date. Cost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee  up  to  a  ceiling  based  on  the  amount  that  has  been  funded.  Contracts  for  development  programs  with  complex  design  and technical challenges are often cost-reimbursable. In these cases, the associated financial risks primarily relate to a reduction in fees and potential program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues",

      "answer": "The combined change in ending balance of the benefit obligation for Boeing and Lockheed Martin defined benefit pension plans from 2021 to 2022 is a decrease of $14,331 million. Boeing's ending balance decreased from $82,415 million in 2021 to $75,635 million in 2022, a decrease of $6,780 million. Lockheed Martin's ending balance decreased from $51,352 million in 2021 to $43,447 million in 2022, a decrease of $7,905 million. Combined, this results in a total decrease of $14,685 million.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nUnder  agreements  reached  with  the  U.S.  Government,  most  of  the  amounts  we  spend  for  environmental  remediation  are allocated  to  our  operations  as  general  and  administrative  costs.  Under  existing  U.S.  Government  regulations,  these  and  other environmental expenditures relating to our U.S. Government business, after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other PRPs, are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services. As a result, most of the expenditures we incur are included in our net sales and cost of sales according to U.S. Government agreement or regulation, regardless of the contract form (e.g. cost-reimbursable, fixed-price). We continually evaluate the recoverability of our assets for the portion of environmental costs that  are  probable  of  future  recovery  by  assessing,  among  other  factors,  U.S.  Government  regulations,  our  U.S.  Government business  base  and  contract  mix,  our  history  of  receiving  reimbursement  of  such  costs,  and  efforts  by  some  U.S.  Government representatives to limit such reimbursement.\n\nIn addition to the proceedings and potential proceedings discussed above, the California State Water Resources Control Board, a  branch  of  the  California  Environmental  Protection Agency,  has  indicated  it  will  work  to  re-establish  a  maximum  level  of  the contaminant  hexavalent  chromium  in  drinking  water  after  a  prior  standard  of  10  parts  per  billion  (ppb)  was  challenged  and withdrawn,  and  is  also  reevaluating  its  existing  drinking  water  standard  of  6  ppb  for  perchlorate.  The  U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency decided in June 2020 not to regulate perchlorate in drinking water at the federal level, although this decision has been challenged, and is considering whether to regulate hexavalent chromium.\n\nIf substantially lower standards are adopted for perchlorate (in California) or for hexavalent chromium (in California or at the federal level), we expect a material increase in our estimates for environmental liabilities and the related assets for the portion of the increased costs that are probable of future recovery in the pricing of our products and services for the U.S. Government. The amount  that  would  be  allocable  to  our  non-U.S.  Government  contracts  or  that  is  determined  not  to  be  recoverable  under  U.S. Government contracts would be expensed, which may have a material effect on our earnings in any particular interim reporting period.\n\nWe also are evaluating the potential impact of existing and contemplated legal requirements addressing a class of chemicals known generally as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). PFAS have been used ubiquitously, such as in fire-fighting foams, manufacturing  processes,  and  stain-  and  stick-resistant  products  (e.g.,  Teflon,  stain-resistant  fabrics).  Because  we  have  used products  and  processes  over  the  years  containing  some  of  those  compounds,  they  likely  exist  as  contaminants  at  many  of  our environmental remediation sites. Governmental authorities have announced plans, and in some instances have begun, to regulate certain of these compounds at extremely low concentrations in drinking water, which could lead to increased cleanup costs at many of our environmental remediation sites.\n\nAs disclosed above, we may record changes in the amount of environmental remediation liabilities as a result of our quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental remediation sites, which would result in a change to the corresponding amount that is probable of future recovery and a charge to earnings. For example, if we were to determine that the liabilities should be increased by $100 million, the corresponding amount that is probable of future recovery would be increased by approximately $87 million, with the remainder recorded as a charge to earnings. This allocation is determined annually, based upon our existing and projected business activities with the U.S. Government.\n\nWe cannot reasonably determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental remediation sites with which we are involved. There are a number of former operating facilities we are monitoring or investigating for potential future environmental remediation. In some cases, although a loss may be probable, it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activities because of uncertainties (e.g., assessing the extent of the contamination). During any particular quarter,  such  uncertainties  may  be  resolved,  allowing  us  to  estimate  and  recognize  the  initial  liability  to  remediate  a  particular former operating site. The amount of the liability could be material. Upon recognition of the liability, a portion will be recognized as a receivable with the remainder charged to earnings, which may have a material effect in any particular interim reporting period.\n\nIf we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a PRP, we expect that the actual costs of  environmental  remediation  will  be  shared  with  other  liable  PRPs.  Generally,  PRPs  that  are  ultimately  determined  to  be responsible parties are strictly liable for site remediation and usually agree among themselves to share, on an allocated basis, the costs and expenses for environmental investigation and remediation. Under existing environmental laws, responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and, therefore, we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation. In the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of cost recovery or contribution from the other PRPs. The amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other PRPs, which we are required to pursue by agreement and U.S. Government regulation.",

      "answer": "Boeing does not specify a dollar amount but explains that if U.S. government contracts are terminated, they are generally entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination costs, whereas Lockheed Martin quantifies that if environmental liabilities increase by $100 million, approximately $87 million would be recoverable under U.S. government contracts, with the remaining $13 million expensed and impacting earnings. This means that Lockheed Martin bears a direct financial exposure on non-U.S. government contracts when environmental costs are not recoverable, whereas Boeing\u2019s exposure under non-U.S. contracts is less explicitly defined but likely tied to similar regulatory and reimbursement frameworks.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From Boeing's 10-K, we learn that U.S. government contracts may be terminated for convenience or default, with compensation for completed work and allowable costs, but exposure under non-U.S. contracts is not quantified.",
        "Step 2: From Lockheed Martin's 10-K, we find a specific financial model: a $100 million increase in environmental liabilities leads to $87 million probable recovery under U.S. government contracts, with $13 million expensed and affecting earnings.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Boeing\u2019s exposure under non-U.S. contracts is implied but not quantified, while Lockheed Martin explicitly shows how non-recoverable costs under non-U.S. contracts directly impact earnings, creating a measurable difference in financial exposure."

We aspire to achieve zero workplace injuries and provide a safe, open and accountable work environment for our employees. We provide several channels for all employees to speak up, ask for guidance and report concerns related to ethics or safety violations. We address employee concerns and take appropriate actions that uphold our Boeing values.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe  commercial  jet  aircraft  market  and  the  airline  industry  remain  extremely  competitive.  We  face  aggressive international  competitors  who  are  intent  on  increasing  their  market  share,  such  as  Airbus  and  other  entrants  from Russia, China and Japan. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts. We intend to continue to compete with other airplane manufacturers by providing customers with higher quality products.\n\nBDS faces strong competition in all market segments, primarily from Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Raytheon Technologies Corporation, General Dynamics Corporation and SpaceX. Non-U.S. companies such as BAE Systems and Airbus Group continue to build a strategic presence in the U.S. market by strengthening their  North American  operations  and  partnering  with  U.S.  defense  companies.  In  addition,  certain  competitors  have occasionally formed teams with other competitors to address specific customer requirements. BDS expects the trend of strong competition to continue into 2022.\n\nThe commercial and defense services markets are extremely challenging and are made up of many of the same strong U.S. and non-U.S. competitors facing BCA and BDS along with other competitors in those markets. BGS leverages our extensive services network offering products and services which span the life cycle of our defense and commercial airplane programs: training, fleet services and logistics, maintenance and engineering, modifications and upgrades, as well as the daily cycle of gate-to-gate operations. BGS expects the market to remain highly competitive in 2022, and intends to grow market share by leveraging a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity.\n\n## Regulatory Matters\n\nOur businesses are heavily regulated in most of our markets. We work with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including but not limited to, all of the branches of the U.S. military, NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exist in our non-U.S. markets.\n\nGovernment Contracts. The U.S. government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience, as well as for default based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. If any of our  U.S.  government  contracts  were  to  be  terminated  for  convenience,  we  generally  would  be  entitled  to  receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the U.S. government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and could require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. The U.S. government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default.\n\nCommercial  Aircraft. In  the  U.S.,  our  commercial  aircraft  products  are  required  to  comply  with  FAA  regulations governing production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. New aircraft models and new derivative aircraft are required to obtain FAA certification prior to entry into  service.  Outside  the  U.S.,  similar  requirements  exist  for  airworthiness,  installation  and  operational  approvals. These requirements are generally",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nUnder  agreements  reached  with  the  U.S.  Government,  most  of  the  amounts  we  spend  for  environmental  remediation  are allocated  to  our  operations  as  general  and  administrative  costs.  Under  existing  U.S.  Government  regulations,  these  and  other environmental expenditures relating to our U.S. Government business, after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other PRPs, are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services. As a result, most of the expenditures we incur are included in our net sales and cost of sales according to U.S. Government agreement or regulation, regardless of the contract form (e.g. cost-reimbursable, fixed-price). We continually evaluate the recoverability of our assets for the portion of environmental costs that  are  probable  of  future  recovery  by  assessing,  among  other  factors,  U.S.  Government  regulations,  our  U.S.  Government business  base  and  contract  mix,  our  history  of  receiving  reimbursement  of  such  costs,  and  efforts  by  some  U.S.  Government representatives to limit such reimbursement.\n\nIn addition to the proceedings and potential proceedings discussed above, the California State Water Resources Control Board, a  branch  of  the  California  Environmental  Protection Agency,  has  indicated  it  will  work  to  re-establish  a  maximum  level  of  the contaminant  hexavalent  chromium  in  drinking  water  after  a  prior  standard  of  10  parts  per  billion  (ppb)  was  challenged  and withdrawn,  and  is  also  reevaluating  its  existing  drinking  water  standard  of  6  ppb  for  perchlorate.  The  U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency decided in June 2020 not to regulate perchlorate in drinking water at the federal level, although this decision has been challenged, and is considering whether to regulate hexavalent chromium.\n\nIf substantially lower standards are adopted for perchlorate (in California) or for hexavalent chromium (in California or at the federal level), we expect a material increase in our estimates for environmental liabilities and the related assets for the portion of the increased costs that are probable of future recovery in the pricing of our products and services for the U.S. Government. The amount  that  would  be  allocable  to  our  non-U.S.  Government  contracts  or  that  is  determined  not  to  be  recoverable  under  U.S. Government contracts would be expensed, which may have a material effect on our earnings in any particular interim reporting period.\n\nWe also are evaluating the potential impact of existing and contemplated legal requirements addressing a class of chemicals known generally as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). PFAS have been used ubiquitously, such as in fire-fighting foams, manufacturing  processes,  and  stain-  and  stick-resistant  products  (e.g.,  Teflon,  stain-resistant  fabrics).  Because  we  have  used products  and  processes  over  the  years  containing  some  of  those  compounds,  they  likely  exist  as  contaminants  at  many  of  our environmental remediation sites. Governmental authorities have announced plans, and in some instances have begun, to regulate certain of these compounds at extremely low concentrations in drinking water, which could lead to increased cleanup costs at many of our environmental remediation sites.\n\nAs disclosed above, we may record changes in the amount of environmental remediation liabilities as a result of our quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental remediation sites, which would result in a change to the corresponding amount that is probable of future recovery and a charge to earnings. For example, if we were to determine that the liabilities should be increased by $100 million, the corresponding amount that is probable of future recovery would be increased by approximately $87 million, with the remainder recorded as a charge to earnings. This allocation is determined annually, based upon our existing and projected business activities with the U.S. Government.\n\nWe cannot reasonably determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental remediation sites with which we are involved. There are a number of former operating facilities we are monitoring or investigating for potential future environmental remediation. In some cases, although a loss may be probable, it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activities because of uncertainties (e.g., assessing the extent of the contamination). During any particular quarter,  such  uncertainties  may  be  resolved,  allowing  us  to  estimate  and  recognize  the  initial  liability  to  remediate  a  particular former operating site. The amount of the liability could be material. Upon recognition of the liability, a portion will be recognized as a receivable with the remainder charged to earnings, which may have a material effect in any particular interim reporting period.\n\nIf we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a PRP, we expect that the actual costs of  environmental  remediation  will  be  shared  with  other  liable  PRPs.  Generally,  PRPs  that  are  ultimately  determined  to  be responsible parties are strictly liable for site remediation and usually agree among themselves to share, on an allocated basis, the costs and expenses for environmental investigation and remediation. Under existing environmental laws, responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and, therefore, we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation. In the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of cost recovery or contribution from the other PRPs. The amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other PRPs, which we are required to pursue by agreement and U.S. Government regulation.",

      "question": "How does the treatment of 'Unallocated Items' differ between BA and LMT in their 2022 financial disclosures, particularly in terms of their impact on consolidated operating profit and segment performance evaluation?",
      "answer": "BA reports 'Unallocated items, eliminations and other' as a minor reconciling item between segment and consolidated operating profit, with a value of $293 million in 2021 and $337 million in 2020, indicating minimal impact on consolidated results. In contrast, LMT explicitly details that 'Unallocated items' include significant exclusions such as the FAS/CAS operating adjustment, corporate costs, legal fees, environmental costs, and stock-based compensation, which are not considered part of segment operating performance but directly affect consolidated operating profit. This shows that while BA treats unallocated items as relatively minor, LMT emphasizes a broader set of adjustments that materially influence financial reporting.",

        "Step 1: From BA's 2022 10-K, extract the value of 'Unallocated items, eliminations and other' as $293 million in 2021 and $337 million in 2020, showing its small impact on total backlog and operating profit reconciliation.",

We discount those cash payments using a discount rate. We determine the discount rate using the weighted-average yields on high-quality fixed-income securities with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits. Lower discount rates increase present values and generally increase subsequent-year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease present values and generally reduce subsequent-year pension expense.\n\nThe compensation assumption is used to estimate the annual rate at which pay of plan participants will grow.

      "question": "Considering the impact of international operations on cash repatriation policies, how does RTX's exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and regulatory restrictions affect its ability to realize financial benefits from overseas earnings compared to EMR's tax treatment of indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings?",
      "answer": "RTX faces potential limitations in realizing financial benefits from its overseas earnings due to exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and regulatory restrictions on cash repatriation, which can lead to higher costs and translation losses. In contrast, EMR does not provide for U.S. federal income taxes on repatriated cash and considers its undistributed foreign earnings indefinitely reinvested, avoiding immediate tax liabilities. This means RTX may face more operational and financial constraints in repatriating cash, while EMR benefits from a more predictable tax treatment of foreign earnings.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - EMR states that cash repatriated to the U.S. is generally not subject to U.S. federal income taxes and that no provision is made for taxes on undistributed earnings considered indefinitely reinvested.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - RTX notes that its international operations are subject to risks including foreign currency fluctuations, regulatory restrictions, and cash repatriation limitations, which may adversely affect its ability to realize financial benefits from overseas earnings.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While EMR benefits from a tax policy that facilitates repatriation without additional U.S. tax burden, RTX faces operational and financial risks that could hinder its ability to efficiently repatriate and utilize foreign earnings."

This requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding the amount and timing of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, expected future taxable income, and the impact of tax planning strategies.\n\nUncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns which remain subject to examination, along with positions expected to be taken in future returns. The Company provides for unrecognized tax benefits, based on the technical merits, when it is more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination. Adjustments are made to the uncertain tax positions when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit; changes in applicable tax laws, including tax case rulings and legislative guidance; or expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.\n\nCash repatriated to the U.S. is generally not subject to U.S. federal income taxes. No provision is made for withholding taxes and any applicable U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries where these earnings are considered indefinitely invested or otherwise retained for continuing international operations. Determination of the amount of taxes that might be paid on these undistributed earnings if eventually remitted is not practicable. See Notes 1 and 14.\n\n## Other Items\n\n## LEGAL MATTERS\n\nAt September 30, 2022, there were no known contingent liabilities (including guarantees, pending litigation, taxes and other claims) that management believes will be material in relation to the Company's financial statements, nor were there any material commitments outside the normal course of business.\n\n## NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\nEffective October 1, 2021, the Company adopted three accounting standard updates which had an immaterial or no impact on the Company's financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2022. These included:\n\n- Updates to Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 805, Business Combinations , which clarify the accounting for contract assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination. In general, this will result in contract liabilities being recognized at their historical amounts under ASC 606, rather than at fair value in accordance with the general requirements of ASC 805.\n- Updates to ASC 740, Income Taxes , which require the recognition of a franchise tax that is partially based on income as an income-based tax with any incremental amount as a non-income based tax. These updates also make certain changes to intra-period tax allocation principles and interim tax calculations.\n- Updates to ASC 321, Equity Securities , ASC 323 Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures , and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , which clarify how to account for the transition into and out of the equity method of accounting when evaluating observable transactions.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, the Company adopted two accounting standard updates and one new accounting standard, and in fiscal 2020 adopted updates to ASC 815, all of which had an immaterial impact on the Company's financial statements. These included:\n\n- Updates to ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other , which eliminate the requirement to measure impairment based on the implied fair value of goodwill compared to the carrying amount of a reporting unit's goodwill. Instead, goodwill impairment will be measured as the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its estimated fair value.\n- Updates to ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other , which align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a software hosting arrangement with the requirements for costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software.\n- Adoption of ASC 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses , which amends the impairment model by requiring entities to use a forward-looking approach to estimate lifetime expected credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables.",

We conduct our business on a global basis, with a significant portion of sales derived from international operations, including U.S. export sales. Changes in local and regional economic conditions, including fluctuations in exchange rates, may affect product demand and reported profits in our non-U.S. operations where transactions may be denominated in local currencies. In addition, currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products. As a result, our operating margins also may be negatively impacted by worldwide currency fluctuations that result in higher  costs  for  certain  cross-border  transactions.  In  addition,  a  strengthening  of  the  U.S.  Dollar  against  other  major  foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations. Our financial statements are denominated in U.S. Dollars, and exchange rate fluctuations may cause translation gains or losses when translating non-U.S. operating unit financial statements. In addition, the majority of our commercial aerospace business sales are transacted in U.S. Dollars, while the majority of costs outside the U.S. are  incurred  in  the  applicable  local  currency;  therefore,  fluctuations  in  the  exchange  rate  of  the  U.S.  Dollar  against  the  local currency could impact our results of operations. Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada is especially susceptible to fluctuations in exchange rates for this reason. To manage certain exposures, we employ long-term hedging strategies associated with U.S. Dollar sales.\n\nOur  international  sales  and  operations  are  subject  to  risks  associated  with  local  government  laws,  regulations  and  policies, including those related to tariffs, import quotas and other trade barriers, investments, taxation, exchange controls, capital controls, employment  regulations,  and  cash  repatriation.  Our  international  sales  and  operations  are  also  sensitive  to  changes  in  foreign national  priorities,  including  government  budgets,  as  well  as  to  regional  and  local  political  and  economic  factors,  including volatility in energy prices, political or civil unrest, changes in threat environments and political relations, geopolitical uncertainties, and changes in U.S. foreign policy. Government policies on international trade and investments, whether adopted by individual governments  or  regional  trade  blocs,  can  affect  demand  for  our  products  and  services,  impact  the  competitive  position  of  our products,  impact  our  supply,  and  prevent  us  from  being  able  to  manufacture  or  sell  products  in  certain  countries.  The implementation  of  more  restrictive  trade  policies,  including  the  imposition  of  tariffs,  or  the  renegotiation  of  existing  trade agreements by the U.S. or by countries where we sell large quantities of products and services or procure supplies of materials or components could negatively affect us. Ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and trends such as populism and economic nationalism, a government's  adoption  of  'buy  national'  policies,  or  a  government's  limiting  exports  of  a  unique  material,  such  as  rare  earth minerals, over which it controls a significant portion of the global supply, or retaliation by another government against any such policies, such as tariffs, could negatively affect us. Further, regime change in a major customer's government could decrease or eliminate its demand for our products and services, as well as adversely affect our supply of materials or components from that county. International transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs and contract laws and regulations, and include contractual terms that differ from those of similar contracts in the U.S. or that may be interpreted differently in foreign countries. As discussed more fully below, our international sales also require us to comply with U.S.  laws,  regulations  and  policies,  including  the  International  Traffic  in Arms  Regulations  (ITAR),  the  Export Administration Regulations  (EAR),  the  Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act  (FCPA),  and  other  anti-corruption,  sanctions,  and  export  laws  and regulations. In addition, in certain foreign countries, our businesses engage non-employee sales representatives. Our use of and association  with  third-party  foreign  representatives  and  consultants  for  international  sales  and  teaming  with  international subcontractors, partners and suppliers in connection with international programs expose us to various challenges including risks associated with the FCPA and local antibribery laws and regulations. From time to time, we have disputes with such representatives regarding claimed commissions and other matters which can result in litigation or arbitration. In addition, we face risks related to the unintended or unauthorized use of our products.\n\nWe conduct business in numerous countries that carry high levels of currency, political, compliance and economic risk. We expect that sales to customers in these countries will continue to account for a significant portion of our commercial aerospace sales as our businesses evolve and as these and other developing nations and regions around the world increase their demand for our products, particularly our aerospace products. Operations in emerging market countries can present many risks, including volatility in gross domestic  product  and  rates  of  economic  growth,  economic  and  government  instability  (particularly  in  certain  Middle  East countries) cultural differences (such as employment and business practices), the imposition of exchange and capital controls, and risks associated with exporting components manufactured in those countries for incorporation into finished products completed in other countries. While these factors and their impact are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could have a material adverse effect  on  our  competitive  position,  results  of  operations,  financial  condition  or  liquidity.  Of  note,  in  2019  the  U.S.  government suspended Turkey's participation in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program because Turkey accepted delivery of the Russian-built S400 air and missile defense system. The U.S. has imposed, and may impose additional, sanctions on Turkey, as well as contractual restrictions  on  the  use  of  Turkish  sources  for  certain  military  programs,  as  a  result  of  this  or  other  political  disputes.  Turkish companies supply components, some of which are sole-sourced, to our aerospace",

Foreign currency translation had a 2 percent unfavorable impact and divestitures deducted 2 percent. Underlying sales increased 13 percent on 3 percent higher volume and 10 percent higher price. Climate Technologies sales were $5.2 billion in 2022, an increase of $452, or 10 percent. Air conditioning, heating and refrigeration sales were strong, reflecting global demand across all end markets. Tools &amp; Home Products sales were $2.0 billion in 2022, up $128 or 7 percent compared to the prior year. Sales of professional tools and food waste disposers were strong, while wet/dry vacuums decreased moderately due to difficult comparisons. Overall, underlying sales increased 15 percent in the Americas (U.S. up 14 percent) and 11 percent in Europe, while Asia, Middle East &amp; Africa increased 5 percent (China down 7 percent). Earnings were $1,440, an increase of $76, and margin was down 0.6 percentage points, as price less net material inflation was favorable but had a slightly dilutive impact on margins and higher freight and other inflation also negatively impacted margins, partially offset by leverage on higher sales and savings from cost reduction actions.\n\n2021 vs. 2020 - Commercial &amp; Residential Solutions sales were $6.7 billion in 2021, an increase of $1,010, or 18 percent. Underlying sales increased 16 percent on strong global demand, as nearly all businesses achieved doubledigit growth each quarter, while foreign currency translation added 2 percent. Climate Technologies sales were $4.7 billion in 2021, an increase of $768, or 19 percent. Air conditioning and heating sales were up mid-teens, reflecting strong demand for residential-oriented products and solutions in North America and robust growth in Europe and China. Cold chain sales were up over 20 percent, driven by favorable global market conditions and strength in food retail and aftermarket. Tools &amp; Home Products sales were $1.9 billion in 2021, up $242 or 15 percent compared to the prior year. Sales of wet/dry vacuums were robust in part due to competitor outages, while sales were strong for global professional tools and solid for food waste disposers. Overall, underlying sales increased 16 percent in the Americas (U.S. up 15 percent) and 17 percent in Europe, while Asia, Middle East &amp; Africa increased 17 percent (China up 17 percent). Earnings were $1,364, an increase of $246, and margin was up 0.7 percentage points, reflecting leverage on higher volume and savings from cost reduction actions, partially offset by unfavorable price-cost primarily due to steel price increases which negatively impacted the second half of the fiscal year.\n\n## Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nEmerson maintains a conservative financial structure to provide the strength and flexibility necessary to achieve our strategic objectives and has been successful in efficiently deploying cash where needed worldwide to fund operations, complete acquisitions and sustain long-term growth.\n\nEmerson is in a strong financial position, with total assets of $36 billion and stockholders' equity of $10 billion, and has the resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and managing its capital structure on a short- and long-term basis.\n\nThe Company continues to generate substantial operating cash flow with over $2.9 billion in each of the last three years. Cash flows have been and are expected to be sufficient for at least the next 12 months to meet the Company's operating requirements, including those related to salaries and wages, working capital, capital expenditures, and other liquidity requirements associated with operations. The Company also has certain contractual obligations, primarily longterm debt and operating leases (see Notes 7, 10 and 11). The Company has been able to readily meet all its funding requirements and currently believes that sufficient funds will be available to meet its needs for the foreseeable future through operating cash flow, existing resources, short- and long-term debt capacity, or its $3.5 billion revolving backup credit facility under which it has not incurred any borrowings.",

See Results of Operations below for our definition of the organic change in Net sales and Operating profit (loss), which are not defined measures under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and may be calculated differently by other companies.\n\nWe also focus on backlog as a key financial performance measure of our forward-looking sales growth. Total backlog was $156 billion  and  $150  billion  as  of  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  respectively.  Backlog,  which  is  equivalent  to  our  remaining performance obligations (RPO) for our sales contracts, represents the aggregate dollar value of firm orders for which products have not  been  provided  or  service  has  not  been  performed  and  excludes  unexercised  contract  options  and  potential  orders  under ordering-type  contracts  (e.g.,  indefinite-delivery,  indefinite-quantity  (IDIQ)  type  contracts).  Segment  backlog  does  not  include intercompany backlog. Backlog generally increases with bookings and/or orders and generally decreases as sales are recognized on these bookings and is affected by changes in foreign exchange rates, as well as contract cancellations and terminations, and cost underruns on cost-type contracts.\n\nIn addition, we maintain a strong focus on program execution and the prudent management of capital and investments in order to maximize operating income and cash. We focus on adjusted earnings per share (EPS) and measures to assess our cash generation and the efficiency and effectiveness of our use of capital, such as free cash flow (FCF), both of which are not defined measures under U.S. GAAP and may be calculated differently by other companies.\n\nConsidered together, we believe these metrics are strong indicators of our overall performance and our ability to create shareowner value. We feel these measures are balanced among long-term and short-term performance, efficiency and growth. We also use these and other performance metrics for executive compensation purposes.\n\nA discussion of our results of operations and financial condition follows below in Results of Operations, Segment Review, and Liquidity and Financial Condition.\n\n## RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nAs described in our 'Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results' in this Form 10-K, our period-to-period comparisons of our results, particularly at a segment level, may not be indicative of our future operating results.

      "answer": "MMM increased its adjusted operating margin from 20.8% (GAAP) to 22.6% (adjusted) by adding back $463 million in litigation costs and a $1,258 million charge for manufactured PFAS products. In contrast, UPS saw its adjusted operating margin decline by 280 basis points to 9.0% in 2023, despite reducing operating expenses by $1.5 billion in air and ground network costs, $641 million in pickup and delivery costs, and $216 million in sorting costs. The difference in margin performance reflects MMM's use of non-GAAP adjustments to exclude special items while UPS faced margin pressure from lower volumes and contractual wage-rate increases under its Teamsters contract, despite cost-cutting measures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From MMM's 10-K, extract the increase in adjusted operating margin from 20.8% to 22.6%, driven by adding back $463 million in litigation costs and a $1,258 million charge for PFAS products.",
        "Step 2: From UPS's 10-K, extract the decline in adjusted operating margin by 280 basis points to 9.0%, despite reducing operating expenses by $1.5 billion (air/ground), $641 million (pickup/delivery), and $216 million (sorting).",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the contrasting outcomes: MMM improved its margin by excluding special items, while UPS experienced margin compression due to volume declines and contractual wage increases despite cost reductions."

      "answer": "MMM's adjusted operating margin increased from 20.8% (GAAP) to 22.6% due to special items such as net costs for significant litigation ($249 million) and adjustments for manufactured PFAS products ($1,258 million loss). In contrast, UPS experienced a decrease in adjusted operating margin by 400 basis points to 18.4%, primarily due to a $1.1 billion drop in adjusted operating profit, driven by lower international volumes and geopolitical tensions. These opposing trends show that MMM benefited from adjustments to special items, while UPS faced margin pressure from operational cost reductions and external factors.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from MMM's 10-K - Adjusted operating margin increased from 20.8% to 22.6% due to special items totaling $328 million (net of litigation and PFAS adjustments).",
        "Step 2: Extract from UPS's 10-K - Adjusted operating margin decreased by 400 basis points to 18.4%, with a $1.1 billion drop in adjusted operating profit driven by lower international volumes and reduced operating expenses.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While MMM's adjusted operating margin improved due to favorable GAAP adjustments, UPS's adjusted operating margin declined due to external geopolitical pressures and lower volumes. The two companies show opposite trends in adjusted operating margin influenced by different factors."

In contrast, UPS's 2022 10-K states that its adjusted financial measures exclude items such as goodwill and asset impairment charges to provide a clearer view of underlying operations. As a result, if CAT were to recognize impairment charges during an economic downturn, its reported financial performance would reflect these costs, whereas UPS would exclude them from its adjusted metrics. This difference in financial reporting frameworks could lead to misalignment when comparing the two companies' financial health and operational performance during similar economic conditions.",

All of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\n\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's financial and operational results will be determined by the length of time that the pandemic continues, its effect on the demand for the Company's products and services and the supply chain, as well as the effect of governmental regulations imposed in response to the pandemic. The overall magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic and the continued fluidity of the situation could materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\n\n## MACROECONOMIC RISKS\n\n## Our business and the industries we serve are highly sensitive to global and regional economic conditions.\n\nOur results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions globally and regionally and in the particular industries we serve.  The demand for our products and services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in periods of economic weakness characterized by lower levels of government and business investment, lower levels of business confidence, lower corporate earnings, high real interest rates, lower credit activity or tighter credit conditions, perceived or actual industry overcapacity, higher unemployment and lower consumer spending. A prolonged period of economic weakness may also result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges.  Economic conditions vary across regions and countries, and demand for our products and services generally increases in those regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment.  Slower economic growth or a change in the global mix of regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe energy, transportation and mining industries are major users of our products, including the mineral extraction, oil and natural gas industries.  Customers in these industries frequently base their decisions to purchase our products and services on the expected future performance of these industries, which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices. Prices of commodities in these industries are frequently volatile and can change abruptly and unpredictably in response to general economic conditions and trends, government actions, regulatory actions, commodity inventories, production and consumption levels, technological innovations, commodity substitutions, market expectations and any disruptions in production or distribution or changes in consumption. Economic conditions affecting the industries we serve may in the future also lead to reduced capital expenditures by our customers. Reduced capital expenditures by our customers are likely to lead to a decrease in the demand for our products and services and may also result in a decrease in demand for aftermarket parts as customers are likely to extend preventative maintenance schedules and delay major overhauls when possible.\n\nThe rates of infrastructure spending, commercial construction and housing starts also play a significant role in our results.  Our products are an integral component of these activities, and as these activities decrease, demand for our products and services may be significantly impacted, which could negatively impact our results.\n\nCommodity price changes, material price increases, fluctuations in demand for our products and services, significant disruptions to our supply chains or significant shortages of labor and material may adversely impact our financial results or our ability to meet commitments to customers.\n\nWe are a significant user of steel and many other commodities required for the manufacture of our products. Increases in the prices of such commodities would increase our costs, negatively impacting our business, results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to fully offset the effect of these increased costs through price increases, productivity improvements or cost reduction programs.\n\nWe rely on suppliers to produce or secure material required for the manufacture of our products. Production challenges at suppliers (including suppliers of semiconductors), a disruption in deliveries to or from suppliers or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs.  On the other hand, in circumstances where demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience excess inventories and be forced to incur additional costs and our profitability may suffer. Additionally, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience transportation delays for parts, components and finished machines due to significant demands in global transportation and congestion at ports throughout the globe. Our business, competitive position, results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted if supply is insufficient for our operations, if significant transportation delays interfere with deliveries, if we experience excess inventories or if we are unable to adjust our production schedules or our purchases from suppliers to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations on a timely basis.",

These include: \"adjusted\" compensation and benefits; operating expenses; operating profit; operating margin; other income and (expense); income before income taxes; income tax expense; effective tax rate; net income; and earnings per share. Adjusted financial measures may exclude the impact of period over period exchange rate changes and hedging activities, amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses, transformation and other charges, goodwill and asset impairment charges and divestitures, as described below.\n\nWe believe that these non-GAAP measures provide additional meaningful information to assist users of our financial statements in more fully understanding our financial results and assessing our ongoing performance, because they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, our underlying operations, and may provide a useful baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. These non-GAAP measures are used internally by management for business unit operating performance analysis, business unit resource allocation and in connection with incentive compensation award determinations.\n\nAdjusted financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

      "answer": "CAT's 2022 10-K highlights that economic weakness could lead to increased goodwill and asset impairment charges due to reduced demand for its products and services, particularly in cyclical industries like energy, transportation, and mining. This implies a causal link between macroeconomic downturns and financial charges for CAT. In contrast, UPS disclosed in its 2022 10-K that it reports operating profit and other financial metrics excluding the impact of goodwill and asset impairment charges, indicating a strategy to adjust for such one-time financial impacts when evaluating performance. This shows that while CAT's operations are vulnerable to economic conditions that may trigger impairments, UPS proactively excludes such charges to provide a clearer view of ongoing operational performance.",

        "Step 1: From CAT's 2022 10-K, extract the statement that 'A prolonged period of economic weakness may also result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges.'

This shows UPS's financial reporting strategy around these charges.",

For more information regarding transformation activities, see note 19 to the audited, consolidated financial statements. For more information regarding goodwill and asset impairment charges and divestitures, see note 4 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates and Hedging Activities\n\nWe also supplement the reporting of revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit with adjusted measures that exclude the period over period impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and hedging activities. We believe currency-neutral revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit information allows users of our financial statements to understand growth trends in our products and results. We evaluate the performance of International Package and Supply Chain Solutions on this currency-neutral basis.\n\nCurrency-neutral revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit are calculated by dividing current period reported U.S. dollar revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit by the current period average exchange rates to derive current period local currency revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit. The derived amounts are then multiplied by the average foreign currency exchange rates used to translate the comparable results for each month in the prior year period (including the period over period impact of foreign currency hedging activities). The difference between the current period reported U.S. dollar revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit and the derived current period U.S. dollar revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit is the period over period impact of currency fluctuations.\n\n## Defined Benefit Plans Mark-to-Market Impacts\n\nWe recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10% corridor for our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans immediately as part of Investment income (expense) and other within Other Income and (Expense) . We supplement the presentation of our income before income taxes, net income and earnings per share with non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of these gains and losses and the related income tax effects. We believe excluding these mark-to-market impacts provides important supplemental information by removing the volatility associated with short-term changes in market interest rates, equity values and similar factors.\n\nInvestment income (expense) and other reflects the actual return on plan assets (9.11% in 2021 and 12.54% in 2020) and the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation at the December 31st measurement date (3.11% in 2021 and 2.87% in 2020). Adjusted Investment income (expense) and other utilizes the expected return on plan assets (6.40% in 2021 and 7.70% in 2020) and the discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost (2.87% in 2021 and 3.55% in 2020).\n\nThe remeasurement of our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans' assets and liabilities resulted in a $3.3 billion mark-to-market gain in 2021 and $6.5 billion loss in 2020.",

      "answer": "CAT explicitly accounts for mark-to-market gains or losses in its net periodic benefit cost calculations, noting that the 2021 mark-to-market gains contributed to a decrease in expense compared to 2020, while the 2022 expected increase in expense of $168 million excludes the impact of mark-to-market gains or losses.

Therefore, CAT incorporates these gains or losses directly into its pension cost trends, while UPS removes them to assess underlying operations.",

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. All of these market risks arise in the normal course of business, as we do not engage in speculative trading activities. In order to manage the risk arising from these exposures, we may utilize a variety of commodity, foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate forward contracts, options and swaps. A discussion of our accounting policy for derivative instruments is provided in note 1 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Commodity Price Risk\n\nWe are exposed to changes in the prices of refined fuels, principally jet-A, diesel and unleaded gasoline, as well as changes in the price of natural gas and other alternative fuels. Currently, the fuel surcharges that we apply to our domestic and international package services are the primary means of reducing the risk of adverse fuel price changes. In order to mitigate the impact of fuel surcharges imposed on us by outside carriers, we regularly adjust the rates we charge for our freight brokerage services. The majority of our contracts for fuel purchases utilize index-based pricing formulas plus or minus a fixed locational/supplier differential. While many of the indices are aligned, each index may fluctuate at a different pace, driving variability in the prices paid for fuel. Because of this, our operating results may be affected should the market price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount or change by amounts that do not result in an adjustment in our fuel surcharges, which can significantly affect our results either positively or negatively in the short-term. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had no commodity contracts outstanding.\n\n## Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\n\nWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, operating expenses and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate. We are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currency-denominated assets, liabilities and cash flows. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Chinese Renminbi and Hong Kong Dollar. We may use forward contracts as well as a combination of purchased and written options to hedge forecasted cash flow currency exposures. These derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods of 12 to 48 months. We also utilize forward contracts to hedge portions of our anticipated cash settlements of intercompany transactions and interest payments on certain debt subject to foreign currency remeasurement.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nWe have issued debt instruments and debt associated with finance leases that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest. We use interest rate swaps as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt. We may also utilize forward starting swaps and similar instruments to lock in all or a portion of the borrowing cost of anticipated debt issuances. Our floating-rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in short-term interest rates.\n\nWe also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized in future periods.\n\nWe have investments in debt securities, as well as cash-equivalent instruments, some of which accrue income at variable rates of interest. Additionally, we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest.\n\n## Sensitivity Analysis\n\nThe following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and equity price risk embedded in our existing financial instruments. We utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous, parallel shifts in exchange rates, interest rate yield curves and commodity and equity prices. For options and instruments with non-linear returns, models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts.",

      "answer": "Boeing (BA) incorporates asset utilization as a key factor in estimating total costs and profits for long-term contracts, particularly for fixed-price development programs like the KC-46A Tanker and Commercial Crew, where changes in estimates can lead to significant catch-up adjustments (e.g., a $2,943 million increase in loss from operations in 2023). FedEx (FDX), on the other hand, evaluates asset utilization when determining the useful lives and salvage values of its capital assets, such as aircraft, which account for approximately 60% of its owned assets. Both companies rely on asset utilization as a predictive metric to manage financial exposure\u2014Boeing in contract profitability and FedEx in asset depreciation\u2014making their financial outcomes sensitive to shifts in operational efficiency, inflation, and asset performance over time.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Boeing uses asset utilization as a factor in estimating costs and profits for long-term contracts, with significant adjustments (e.g., $2,943 million in 2023) resulting from changes in estimates.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - FedEx evaluates asset utilization when determining the depreciation schedules and salvage values of long-lived assets, particularly aircraft, which represent 60% of its owned assets.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies rely on asset utilization as a predictive and financial planning tool, though applied in different contexts: Boeing for contract accounting and profit estimation, and FedEx for asset depreciation and useful life determination. This shared reliance highlights how economic and operational variables influence financial forecasting across different industrial sectors."

      "answer": "The total amount of tax-related cash inflows mentioned is $1.726 billion, combining Boeing's $1.5 billion income tax refund in 2022 and FedEx's $226 million cumulative benefit from its interpretation of the TCJA. Boeing\u2019s tax refund directly improved its operating cash flow in 2022, providing immediate liquidity. In contrast, FedEx\u2019s $226 million benefit is a contingent, unrecognized tax position tied to ongoing litigation, with no immediate cash impact unless the court rules favorably and a refund is ultimately received.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Boeing's 2022 operating cash flow included a $1.5 billion income tax refund.",

      "answer": "Emerson recognized a mark-to-market gain of $56 million in fiscal 2023 on its equity investment in National Instruments Corporation, which was excluded from pro forma results to reflect the economic reality of the transaction. In contrast, UPS recognized a mark-to-market gain of $3.3 billion ($2.5 billion after tax) in 2021 related to its pension plan following the enactment of the American Rescue Plan Act, which was included in Investment income and other on the income statement. Emerson's gain was tied to an equity investment linked to a specific acquisition, while UPS's gain stemmed from pension plan adjustments due to regulatory changes. These differences in source, timing, and treatment indicate that the mark-to-market gains are not comparable and should be carefully evaluated when assessing the companies' core operating performance, as they reflect distinct non-operational, one-time accounting adjustments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Emerson recognized a $56 million mark-to-market gain on its equity investment in National Instruments Corporation in fiscal 2023, which was excluded from pro forma results.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - UPS recognized a $3.3 billion pre-tax mark-to-market gain ($2.5 billion after tax) in 2021 related to its pension plan due to the American Rescue Plan Act, which was included in Investment income and other.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The mark-to-market gains differ significantly in amount, source (equity investment vs. pension plan), and financial statement treatment (excluded vs. included in operating results), which affects the comparability of the companies' core earnings."

      "answer": "Emerson (EMR) recognized a mark-to-market gain of $56 million from its equity investment in National Instruments, while UPS reported a mark-to-market loss of $359 million from remeasurements of its defined benefit plans. The combined financial impact of these mark-to-market adjustments is a net loss of $303 million ($56M gain - $359M loss). This reflects opposing effects on their financial statements: Emerson experienced a positive valuation adjustment on its investment, whereas UPS faced a significant loss tied to pension plan remeasurements, which was a reversal from a $1.1 billion gain in the prior year.",

For commingled equity funds not traded on an active exchange, or if the closing price is not available, the trustee obtains indicative quotes from a pricing vendor, broker or investment manager. These securities are categorized as Level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated quotes from a pricing vendor.\n\nFixed income investments categorized as Level 1 are publicly exchange-traded. Fixed income investments, including interest rate swaps, categorized as Level 2 are valued by the trustee using pricing models that use verifiable observable market data (e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals and credit spreads), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Fix ed income investments are categorized as  Level  3  when  valuations  using  observable  inputs  are  unavailable.  The  trustee  typically  obtains  pricing  based  on  indicative  quotes  or  bid  evaluations  from vendors, brokers or the investment manager. In addition, certain other fixed income investments categorized as Level 3 are valued using a discounted cash flow approach. Significant inputs include projected annuity payments and the discount rate applied to those payments.\n\nCertain  fix ed  income  funds  are  recorded  using  the  NAV   practical  ex pedient.  The  NAV   valuations  are  based  on  the  underlying  investments  and  typically redeemable within 90 days. The NAV is the total value of the fund divided by the number of the fund's shares outstanding.\n\nPrivate equity funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV practical expedient. The NAV valuations are based on valuation models of the underlying securities, which includes unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated using verifiable observable market data. These funds typically have terms between eight and 12 years.\n\nReal estate funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on valuation models and periodic appraisals. These funds typically have terms between eight and 10 years.\n\nHedge funds generally consist of separate accounts and commingled funds and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on the valuation of the underlying investments. Redemptions in hedge funds generally range from a minimum of one month to several months.\n\n## Contributions and Expected Benefit Payments\n\nThe required funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with ERISA, as amended, and in a manner consistent with CAS and Internal Revenue Code rules. We made $990 million of cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2024. There are no expected required contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2025.\n\nThe following table presents estimated future benefit payments as of December 31, 2024 (in millions):\n\n",

BUSINESS\n\n(Dollars in millions, except per-share amounts or unless otherwise noted)\n\n## BUSINESS OVERVIEW\n\nGeneral Dynamics is a global aerospace and defense company that specializes in high-end design, engineering and manufacturing to deliver state-of-the-art solutions to our customers. We offer a broad portfolio of products and  services  in  business  aviation;  ship  construction  and  repair;  land  combat  vehicles,  weapons  systems  and munitions; and technology products and services. Our leadership positions in attractive business aviation and defense markets enable us to deliver superior and enduring shareholder returns.\n\nOur company consists of 10 business units, which are organized into four operating segments: Aerospace, Marine Systems, Combat Systems and Technologies. We refer to the latter  three  collectively  as  our  defense segments. To optimize its market focus, customer intimacy, agility and operating expertise, each business unit is responsible for the development and execution of its strategy and operating results. This structure allows for a lean corporate function, which sets the overall strategy and governance for the company and is responsible for allocating and deploying capital.\n\nOur  business  units  seek  to  deliver  superior  operating  results  by  endeavoring  to  build  industry-leading franchises.  To  achieve  this  goal,  we  invest  in  advanced  technologies,  pursue  a  culture  of  continuous improvement, and strive to be the low-cost, high-quality provider in each of our markets. The result is long-term value creation measured by strong earnings and cash flow and an attractive return on capital.\n\nOver  the  past  nine  years,  we  have  invested  approximately  $22  billion  to  create,  renew  or  expand  our portfolio  of  products  and  services  across  our  businesses  to  drive  long-term  growth  and  shareholder  value creation.

      "question": "How does the change in Caterpillar's customer advances from 2022 to 2023 compare to the significance of customer advances in General Dynamics' revenue recognition timing, particularly in their defense and aerospace segments?",
      "answer": "Caterpillar's customer advances increased from $1,860 million in 2022 to $1,929 million in 2023, reflecting a $69 million growth. This increase indicates a shift in the timing and volume of advance payments received from customers. In contrast, General Dynamics explicitly describes the role of customer advances in shaping revenue recognition timing, particularly in their defense and aerospace segments. In defense, customer advances are less common, and billing typically follows revenue recognition, creating contract assets. However, international contracts sometimes result in customer advances before revenue is recognized, creating contract liabilities. In aerospace, General Dynamics often receives deposits upon contract execution and milestone achievements, which are later liquidated as revenue. Therefore, while Caterpillar's customer advances grew modestly, General Dynamics highlights a more structured and segment-specific impact of these advances on financial reporting timing.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from Caterpillar's 2023 10-K - Customer advances were $1,929 million in 2023 and $1,860 million in 2022, showing a $69 million increase.",
        "Step 2: Extract from General Dynamics' 2023 10-K - Customer advances are explicitly tied to revenue recognition timing, with differences across defense and aerospace segments.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Caterpillar's numerical change in customer advances is minor but present, while General Dynamics explains how such advances directly affect when revenue is recognized, particularly in international defense contracts and aerospace deposits."

COMPANY-SPONSORED EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\n\nWe sponsor various retirement, postretirement and pension plans, including defined benefit and defined contribution plans, which cover our employees worldwide.\n\n## U.S. Pension Benefits\n\nIn the U.S. we maintain the following single-employer defined benefit pension plans:\n\n- The UPS Retirement Plan is noncontributory and includes substantially all eligible employees of participating domestic subsidiaries hired prior to July 1, 2016 who are not members of a collective bargaining unit, as well as certain employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement. This plan generally provides for retirement benefits based on average compensation earned by employees prior to retirement. Benefits payable under this plan are subject to maximum compensation limits and the annual benefit limits for a tax -qualified defined benefit plan as prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service ('IRS'). The plan ceased accruals of additional benefits for future service and compensation for non-union participants effective January 1, 2023.\n- The UPS Pension Plan is noncontributory and includes certain eligible employees of participating domestic subsidiaries and members of collective bargaining units that elect to participate in the plan. This plan generally provides for retirement benefits based on service credits earned by employees prior to retirement.\n- The UPS/IBT Full-Time Employee Pension Plan is noncontributory and includes employees that were previously members of the Central States Pension Fund (\"CSPF\"), a multiemployer pension plan, in addition to other eligible employees who are covered under certain collective bargaining agreements. This plan generally provides for retirement benefits based on service credits earned by employees prior to retirement.\n- The UPS Excess Coordinating Benefit Plan is a non-qualified plan that provides benefits to certain participants in the UPS Retirement Plan, hired prior to July 1, 2016, for amounts that ex ceed the benefit limits described above. The plan ceased accruals of additional benefits for future service and compensation for non-union participants effective January 1, 2023\n\nRefer to note 6 for the status of our collective bargaining agreements.\n\n## International Pension Benefits\n\nWe also sponsor various defined benefit plans covering certain of our international employees. The majority of our international obligations are for defined benefit plans in Canada and the United Kingdom. In addition, many of our international employees are covered by government-sponsored retirement and pension plans. We are not directly responsible for providing benefits to participants of government-sponsored plans.\n\nDuring 2022, we amended certain Canadian defined benefit pension plans to cease future benefit accruals effective December 31, 2023. We remeasured plan assets and benefit obligations for the plans, which resulted in curtailment gains of $34 million ($24 million after tax ). These gains were included in Investment income (expense) and other in our statement of consolidated income for the year ended December 31, 2022.",

      "question": "How did RTX and UPS each explain their 2024 operating profit declines, and what does this reveal about their distinct operational risks?",
      "answer": "RTX reported a $1.9 billion decrease in operating profit in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily driven by a $2.9 billion charge at Pratt & Whitney related to the Powder Metal Matter, as well as a $0.9 billion charge from the Resolution of Certain Legal Matters and a $0.6 billion charge from the Raytheon Contract Termination. These were partially offset by gains from the sale of the CIS business and a tax-related indemnity receivable. This indicates that RTX's operational risks are heavily tied to legal liabilities and contract terminations in its defense and aerospace segments. On the other hand, UPS reported a $40 million decrease in operating profit, driven by higher pickup and delivery costs ($187 million), package sortation costs ($54 million), and an $88 million expense from a one-time international regulatory settlement. These increases were partially offset by lower air network costs ($126 million). UPS\u2019s operational risks are more aligned with logistics costs, regulatory matters, and international market disruptions. Together, this reveals that while RTX faces significant risks from legal and contractual issues in manufacturing and defense contracting, UPS faces risks tied to global logistics, cost management, and regulatory compliance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From RTX's 10-K, extract the $1.9 billion operating profit decrease and the specific charges including $2.9 billion for the Powder Metal Matter, $0.9 billion for legal matters, and $0.6 billion for the Raytheon contract termination.",
        "Step 2: From UPS's 10-K, extract the $40 million operating profit decrease and the contributing factors: $187 million in pickup and delivery costs, $54 million in sortation costs, $88 million in regulatory settlement, partially offset by $126 million in air cost savings.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the differences in causes of profit declines to highlight the distinct operational risks faced by each company\u2014RTX in legal and contract matters, and UPS in logistics and regulatory issues."

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Operating Expenses\n\nOperating expenses, and non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses, increased year over year. Pickup and delivery costs increased $187 million driven by increased total delivery stops and costs of purchased transportation. Package sortation costs increased $54 million, as a result of higher year-over-year export volumes, and expanded weekend operations, included in this activity are compensation and benefit costs. Additionally, we incurred an $88 million expense during 2024 related to the settlement of a previously disclosed one-time international regulatory matter. These increases were partially offset by reductions in air network costs of $126 million, driven by lower average fuel prices and reductions in air charters and aircraft block hours in response to lower volumes in the first half of the year. We expect overall operating expenses to increase in 2025 primarily as a result of ex pected volume increases.\n\nNon-GAAP adjusted operating expenses in 2024 exclude the impact of the $88 million regulatory expense noted above, $2 million in asset impairment charges and $79 million in transformation strategy expenses. Transformation strategy activities within our International Package segment during 2024 primarily consisted of compensation and benefits expenses related to workforce reductions under our Fit to Serve program. For additional information on these programs and the related costs, see 'Supplemental Information - Items Affecting Comparability.'\n\n## Operating Profit and Margin\n\nAs a result of the factors described above, operating profit decreased $40 million, with operating margin decreasing 30 basis points to 17.8%. Non-GAAP adjusted operating profit increased $78 million and non-GAAP adjusted operating margin increased 30 basis points to 18.7%.\n\nDuring 2024, we completed the previously disclosed liquidation of our Small Package subsidiaries in Russia and Belarus. The process of liquidating our Forwarding and Logistics subsidiaries in Russia are on-going and we expect to finalize the liquidation in 2025. Substantially all of our operations in Ukraine remain indefinitely suspended. These actions have not had, and are not expected to have, a material impact on us.",

      "answer": "An analyst could infer that GE's $50 million in supplier advances likely represents significant upfront payments for parts to be received in the future, similar to BA's practice where supplier advances are amortized to work in process as parts are delivered. Given BA's explanation that such advances are tied to long-term production cycles and are gradually amortized, GE's supplier advances suggest a comparable approach to managing working capital and inventory costs over extended manufacturing timelines. This implies GE may experience similar patterns of inventory amortization as BA, aligning with industry practices for large-scale, long-term manufacturing programs.",

We  routinely  assess,  based  on  in-depth  studies,  expert  analyses  and  legal  rev iews,  our  contingencies,  obligations  and commitments for  remediation  of  contaminated  sites,  including  assessments  of  ranges  and  probabilities  of  recov eries  from  other  responsible  parties and/or insurance carriers. Our policy is to accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures related to env ironmental remediation sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The amount of the liability is based on our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible exposure for inv estigation, cleanup and monitoring costs to be incurred. Estimated remediation costs are not discounted to present v alue as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. We may be able to recov er a portion of the remediation costs from insurers or other third parties. Such recov eries are recorded when realization of the claim for recov ery is deemed probable.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments, such as commercial paper, time deposits and other money market instruments, which have original maturities of three months or less. We aggregate our cash balances by bank where conditions for right of set-off are met, and reclassify any negativ e balances, consisting mainly of uncleared checks, to Accounts payable. Negativ e balances reclassified to Accounts payable were $110  and $117 at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInv entoried  costs  on  commercial aircraft programs and long-term contracts include direct engineering, production and tooling and other non-recurring costs, and applicable ov erhead, which includes fringe benefits, production related indirect and plant management salaries and plant serv ices, not in excess  of  estimated  net  realizable  v alue.  T o  the  extent  a  material  amount  of  such  costs  are  related  to  an  abnormal  ev ent  or  are  fixed  costs  not appropriately attributable to our programs or contracts, they are expensed in the current period rather than inv entoried. Inv entoried costs include amounts relating  to  programs  and  contracts  with  long-term  production  cycles,  a  portion  of  which  is  not  expected  to  be  realized  within  one  year .  Included  in inv entory for federal gov ernment contracts is an allocation of allowable costs related to manufacturing process reengineering.\n\nCommercial aircraft  programs  inv entory  includes  deferred  production  costs  and  supplier  adv ances.  Deferred  production  costs  represent  actual  costs incurred for production of early units that exceed the estimated av erage cost of all units in the program accounting quantity. Higher production costs are experienced at the beginning of a new or deriv ativ e aircraft program. Units produced early in a program require substantially more effort (labor and other resources) than units produced later in a program because of v olume efficiencies and the effects of learning. We expect that these deferred costs will be fully  recov ered  when  all  units  included  in  the  accounting  quantity  are  deliv ered  as  the  expected  unit  cost  for  later  deliv eries  is  below  the  estimated average cost of all units in the program. Supplier adv ances represent payments for parts we hav e contracted to receiv e from suppliers in the future. As parts are receiv ed, supplier adv ances are amortized to work in process.\n\nThe determination of net realizable v alue of long-term contract costs is based upon quarterly rev iews that estimate costs to be incurred to complete all contract requirements. When actual contract costs and the estimate to complete exceed total estimated contract rev enues, a loss prov ision is recorded. The determination of net realizable v alue of commercial aircraft program costs is based upon quarterly program rev iews that estimate rev enue and cost to be incurred to complete the program accounting quantity. When estimated costs to complete exceed estimated program rev enues to go, a program loss prov ision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undeliv ered units in the accounting quantity.",

During the year ended December 31, 2024, we determined that estimated costs to complete the 777X  program plus the costs already included in 777X  inv entory exceed estimated rev enues from the program. The resulting reach-forward loss of $3,499 was recorded as a reduction of deferred production costs and other non-recurring costs. The lev el of profitability on the  777X   program  will  be  subject  to  sev eral  factors.  T hese  factors  include  aircraft  certification  requirements  and  timing,  change  incorporation  on completed aircraft, production disruption due to labor instability and supply chain disruption, customer considerations, deliv ery timing and negotiations, further production rate adjustments for the 777X  or other commercial aircraft programs, and contraction of the accounting quantity. One or more of these factors could result in additional reach-forward losses in future periods.\n\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, commercial aircraft programs inv entory included the following amounts related to the 787 program: deferred production costs of $13,178 and $12,384, supplier adv ances of $1,379 and $1,764, and unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs of $1,370 and $1,480. At December 31, 2024, $11,224 of 787 deferred production costs, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expected to be recov ered from units included in the program accounting quantity that hav e firm orders, and $3,324 are expected to be recov ered from units included in the program accounting quantity that represent expected future orders. We expensed abnormal production costs of $256, $1,014, and $1,240 during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\nCommercial aircraft programs inv entory included amounts credited in cash or other consideration (early issue sales consideration) to airline customers totaling $5,837 and $4,126 at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\n## Note 9 - Contracts with Customers\n\nUnbilled receiv ables increased from $8,317 at December 31, 2023, to $8,363 at December 31, 2024, primarily driv en by rev enue recognized in excess of billings at BDS, partially offset by an increase in billings at BGS.\n\nThe following table summarizes our contract assets under long-term contracts that were unbillable or related to outstanding claims as of December 31:\n\n",

These disruptions are part of the broader aerospace industry challenges that GE Aerospace explicitly monitors, particularly in relation to its significant business with Boeing.

T he  CFT   launched  on  June  5,  2024,  and  docked  with  the  ISS.  T he  Starliner  spacecraft  had  a  minimum  mission duration  of  8  days.  Its  return  to  Earth  was  delayed  to  allow  time  to  perform  further  testing  of  propulsion  system  anomalies  and  returned  to  Earth uncrewed in September 2024. During 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss by $523 primarily to reflect schedule delays and higher testing and certification costs as well as higher costs for post certification missions. At December 31, 2024, we had approximately $398 of capitalized precontract costs and $150 of potential termination liabilities to suppliers related to unauthorized future missions. Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods.\n\n## Severance\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we announced plans to reduce our ov erall workforce. As a result, we recorded $295 of sev erance benefits payable to employees expected to leave the Company through inv oluntary terminations by the first half of 2025. The sev erance packages are consistent with our ongoing compensation and benefits plans. The remaining liability at December 31, 2024, was $287.\n\n## Note 15 - Arrangements with Off-Balance Sheet Risk\n\nWe enter into arrangements with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business, primarily in the form of guarantees.\n\nThe following table prov ides quantitativ e data regarding our third party guarantees.

The consolidated financial statements of GE A erospace are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GA A P). Unless otherwise noted, tables are presented in U.S. dollars in millions. Certain columns and rows within tables may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages presented in this report are calculated from the underlying numbers in millions. Discussions throughout this M D&amp;A  are based on continuing operations unless otherwise noted. The M D&amp;A should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn the accompanying analysis of financial information, we sometimes use information derived from consolidated financial data but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of these data are considered 'non-GAAP financial measures' under SEC rules. See the Non-GAAP Financial M easures section for the reasons we use these non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable GA A P financial measures.\n\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW AND ENVIRONMENT. As a global aerospace company, our worldwide operations can be affected by industrial, economic, and political factors on both a regional and global level. Demand for our equipment and services is demonstrated by our backlog of engine orders and services and growth in our installed base, and tends to follow commercial air travel and freight demand and government funding for defense budgets. We also expect a significant ramp in our delivery of engine units and services for newer product platforms in the years ahead to meet this demand. Refer to the Segment Operations sections for Commercial Engines &amp; Services and Defense &amp; Propulsion Technologies below for additional detail about these dynamics for our commercial and defense businesses, respectively.\n\nGlobal material availability and supplier delivery performance continue to cause disruptions and have impacted our production and delivery of equipment and services to our customers. We are investing in our manufacturing facilities, overhaul facilities and our supply chain to increase production and strengthen yield in order to improve delivery to our customers. We continue to partner with our suppliers to improve material input, and work with our customers to calibrate future production rates. We are leveraging FLIGHT DECK and partnering with suppliers to improve material input and proactively manage the impact of inflationary pressure by driving cost productivity and adjusting the pricing of our products and services. We expect the impact of supply chain constraints and inflation will continue, and we are continuing to take action to mitigate the impacts.\n\nGiven the significant business we have with airframers and many airlines, challenges affecting the commercial aviation industry or key participants can adversely impact the demand for our products and services, the timing of orders, deliveries and related payments and other factors. We are monitoring the production and other challenges at The Boeing Company, and we continue to align with them on production expectations and assess potential impacts to our business. The Boeing worker's strike, resolved in the fourth quarter of 2024, had no significant impact to our revenue, earnings and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\n## CONSOLIDATED RESULTS\n\n",

The debt securities are valued at the closing price reported if traded on an active market or at yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings or valued under a discounted cash flow approach that utilizes observable inputs, such as current yields of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks.\n\nPrivate equity funds consist of partnership interests in a variety of funds which are valued at NAV as described above. Real estate consists of property funds and REITS (Real Estate Investment Trusts). REITS are valued at NAV with published prices provided by the custodians.\n\nAbsolute return consists primarily of private partnership interests in hedge funds, insurance contracts and derivative instruments. Partnerships and hedge funds are valued at NAV as described above. Insurance consists of insurance contracts, which are valued using cash surrender values which is the amount the plan would receive if the contract was cashed out at year end. Derivative instruments consist of various swaps and bond futures that are used to help manage risks and are valued by the custodian using closing market swap curves and market derived input\n\nOther items to reconcile to fair value of plan assets include the net of interest receivables, amounts due for securities sold, amounts payable for securities purchased and interest payable. At December 31, 2024 the net payable includes a payable of $88 million to the Canadian Solventum pension.\n\nThe balances of and changes in the fair values of the international pension plans' level 3 assets consist primarily of insurance contracts under the absolute return asset class. In 2024 the aggregate of net purchases and net unrealized gains and losses decreased this balance by $43 million and the change in currency exchange rates decreased this balance by $37 million for a net decrease of $80 million. In 2023 the aggregate net purchases and net unrealized gains increased this balance by $138 million and the change in currency exchange rates increased the balance by $6 million for a net increase to this balance of $144 million.",

          "chunk_text": "\nRemaining Performance Obligations  (RPO). RPO  represents  the  aggregate  amount  of  total  contract  transaction  price  that  is unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied. Total RPO was $156 billion as of December 31, 2021. Of the total RPO as of December 31, 2021, we expect approximately 30% will be recognized as sales over the next 12 months. This percentage of RPO to be recognized as sales over the next 12 months depends on our current estimates of future developments, which are highly uncertain, and cannot be  predicted,  including  new  information  which  may  emerge  concerning  the  scope,  severity  and  duration  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic, actions to contain its spread or treat its impact, and governmental, business and individuals' actions taken in response to the pandemic, which may result in customer delays or order cancellations. Approximately 40% of our RPO relates to long-term commercial aerospace maintenance contracts at Pratt &amp; Whitney, which are generally expected to be realized over a span of up to 15 years.\n\nResearch and Development. Company-sponsored research and development costs, including those costs related to the Company's portion  in  connection  with  cost-sharing  arrangements,  are  charged  to  expense  as  incurred  and  recovery  on  these  cost-sharing arrangements  is  recorded  as  a  reduction  to  research  and  development  expense  as  earned.  Customer-sponsored  research  and development projects performed under contracts with customers are accounted for as contract costs and reported as cost of sales on the related revenue generating contracts.\n\nForeign Exchange. We conduct business in many different currencies and, accordingly, are subject to the inherent risks associated with foreign exchange rate movements. The financial position and results of operations of many of our foreign subsidiaries are often  measured  using  the  local  currency  as  the  functional  currency.  Foreign  currency  denominated  assets  and  liabilities  are translated into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rates existing at the respective balance sheet dates, and income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates during the respective periods. The aggregate effects of translating the balance sheets of these subsidiaries are deferred as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) in shareowners' equity. Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses are recorded in Other income, net on our Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n\nDerivatives and Hedging Activity. We use derivative instruments, including swaps, forward contracts and options, to help manage certain foreign currency, and from time to time to help manage interest rate and commodity price exposures. Derivative instruments are  viewed  as  risk  management  tools  by  us  and  are  not  used  for  trading  or  speculative  purposes.  By  their  nature,  all  financial instruments involve market and credit risks. We enter into derivative and other financial instruments with major investment grade financial  institutions  and  have  policies  to  monitor  the  credit  risk  of  those  counterparties.  We  limit  counterparty  exposure  and concentration  of  risk  by  diversifying  counterparties.  While  there  can  be  no  assurance,  we  do  not  anticipate  any  material  nonperformance by any of these counterparties. We enter into transactions that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or  similar  agreements  with  various  counterparties.  However,  we  have  not  elected  to  offset  multiple  contracts  with  a  single counterparty and, as a result, the fair value of the derivative instruments in a loss position is not offset against the fair value of derivative instruments in a gain position.\n\nDerivatives used for hedging purposes may be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract. All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives used to hedge foreign currency denominated balance sheet items are reported directly in earnings along with offsetting transaction gains and losses on the items being  hedged.  Derivatives  used  to  hedge  forecasted  cash  flows  associated  with  foreign  currency  commitments  or  forecasted commodity  purchases  may  be  accounted  for  as  cash  flow  hedges,  as  deemed  appropriate.  Gains  and  losses  on  derivatives designated  as  cash  flow  hedges  are  recorded  in  other  comprehensive  income  and  reclassified  to  earnings  as  a  component  of products sales or expenses, as applicable, when the hedged transaction occurs. Cash payments or receipts on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in Other operating activities, net within the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. To the extent that  a  previously  designated  hedging  transaction  is  no  longer  an  effective  hedge,  any  ineffectiveness  measured  in  the  hedging relationship is recorded currently in earnings in the period it occurs.",

      "answer": "GE's adoption of the new GAAP guidance on long-duration insurance contracts will significantly affect its financial statements, particularly by changing how insurance liabilities are measured. This includes annual reviews of cash flow assumptions and the use of a lower single-A discount rate, which could reduce GAAP earnings if statutory assumptions are realized. This regulatory shift introduces uncertainty into GE's financial reporting and could affect its organic profit stability. In contrast, RTX experienced a $2.1 billion organic profit decrease in 2020, primarily due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and unfavorable EAC adjustments on commercial engine contracts, such as a $334 million EAC adjustment driven by lower estimated revenues. While GE's changes are accounting-driven and may affect future earnings through discount rate adjustments, RTX's profit fluctuations are operationally driven by external market conditions and contract adjustments. Both companies face challenges in maintaining organic profit stability, but through different mechanisms: GE through regulatory accounting changes and RTX through market and contract dynamics.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - GE is adopting new GAAP guidance that will change how long-duration insurance liabilities are measured, including the use of a lower single-A discount rate and annual cash flow assumption reviews, which could materially affect GAAP earnings.",

This allows for a comparative analysis of how each company's organic profit stability is affected by regulatory and operational factors."

          "chunk_text": "If our future policy benefit reserves established under GAAP are realized over the estimated remaining life of our run-off insurance obligations, we would expect the $14.5 billion of capital contributed to the run-off insurance operations over the 2018 to 2024 period to be considered statutory capital surplus at the end of the estimated remaining life with no additional charge to GAAP earnings. However, should the more conservative statutory assumptions be realized, we would be required to record the difference between GAAP assumptions and statutory assumptions as a charge to GAAP earnings in the future periods. See Other Items - New Accounting Standards and Notes 1 and 11 for further information.\n\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new guidance on accounting for long-duration insurance contracts that is effective for our interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2023, with an election to adopt early, and restatement of prior periods presented. We intend to adopt the new guidance effective January 1, 2023 (with transition adjustments as of January 1, 2021), using the modified retrospective transition method where permitted. We are evaluating the effect of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and anticipate that its adoption will significantly change the accounting for measurements of our long-duration insurance liabilities. The new guidance requires cash flow assumptions used in the measurement of various insurance liabilities to be reviewed at least annually and updated if actual experience or other evidence indicates previous assumptions need to be revised with any required changes recorded in earnings. Under the current accounting guidance, the discount rate is based on expected investment yields, while under the new guidance the discount rate will be equivalent to the upper-medium grade (i.e., single A) fixed-income instrument yield reflecting the duration characteristics of the liability and is required to be updated in each reporting period with changes recorded in other comprehensive income. We expect that the single-A rate under the new guidance at the transition date will be lower than our current discount rate. In measuring the insurance liabilities under the new guidance, contracts shall not be grouped together from different issue years. These changes will result in the elimination of premium deficiency testing and shadow adjustments. While we continue to evaluate the effect of the new guidance on our ongoing financial reporting, we anticipate that its adoption will materially affect our financial statements and require changes to certain of our processes, systems, and controls. As the new guidance is only applicable to the measurements of our long-duration insurance liabilities under GAAP, it will not affect the accounting for our insurance reserves or the levels of capital and surplus under statutory accounting practices.\n\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. We believe that presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides management and investors useful measures to evaluate performance and trends of the total company and its businesses. This includes adjustments in recent periods to GAAP financial measures to increase period-to-period comparability following actions to strengthen our overall financial position and how we manage our business. In addition, management recognizes that certain non-GAAP terms may be interpreted differently by other companies under different circumstances. In various sections of this report we have made reference to the following non-GAAP financial measures in describing our (1) revenues, specifically organic revenues by segment; organic revenues, and equipment and services organic revenues (2) profit, specifically organic profit and profit margin by segment; Adjusted profit and profit margin (excluding certain items); Adjusted organic profit and profit margin; Adjusted earnings (loss); and Adjusted earnings (loss) per share (EPS). The reasons we use these non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures follow.\n\n## ORGANIC REVENUES, PROFIT (LOSS) AND PROFIT MARGIN BY SEGMENT (NON-GAAP)\n\n",

The change in organic operating profit was also impacted by $106 million of lower government wage subsidies, and the absence of prior year unfavorable EAC adjustments on certain commercial aftermarket and military programs, as discussed below.\n\nThe increase in other operating profit of $0.1 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by the absence of an $89 million  impairment  of  commercial  aircraft  program  assets  and  $43  million  of  reserves  related  to  a  commercial  financing arrangement, both recorded in the prior year.\n\n## 2020 Compared with 2019\n\nThe organic sales decrease of $4.1 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily reflects lower commercial aftermarket sales of $3.8 billion, due to a significant reduction in shop visits and related spare part sales, and lower commercial OEM sales of $1.1 billion, primarily  due  to  a  significant  reduction  in  commercial  engine  deliveries,  all  principally  driven  by  the  economic  and  operating environment primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These declines were partially offset by higher military sales of $0.8 billion primarily  driven  by  an  increase  in  F135  engine  sales  and  aftermarket  growth  on  multiple  platforms.  Included  in  the  lower commercial  aftermarket  sales  is  a  $0.4  billion  impact  to  sales  from  the  net  unfavorable  contract  adjustments  discussed  further below.\n\nThe  organic  profit  decrease  of  $2.1  billion  in  2020  compared  to  2019  was  primarily  driven  by  lower  commercial  aftermarket operating profit of $2.4 billion driven by the sales volume decrease discussed above, unfavorable mix, a $334 million unfavorable EAC adjustment on a commercial engine aftermarket contract due to lower estimated revenues driven by a change in the estimated maintenance  coverage  period,  an  unfavorable  EAC  adjustment  of  $129  million  related  to  lower  estimated  revenues  due  to  the restructuring  of  a  customer  contract,  and  $86  million  related  to  an  unfavorable  EAC  adjustment  and  increased  allowances  for warranty for legacy fleet related retrofits. The decrease was also driven by higher selling, general and administrative expenses of $0.2 billion primarily driven by $257 million of increased estimates of expected credit losses due to customer bankruptcies and additional allowances for credit losses, primarily related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This decrease in organic profit was partially offset by lower research and development costs of $0.3 billion, which includes the impact of cost reduction initiatives, and other income of $153 million related to foreign government wage subsidies due to COVID-19.\n\nIncluded in organic profit was an increase in net unfavorable EAC adjustments of $544 million, which included the unfavorable EAC adjustments discussed above and significant net unfavorable EAC adjustments of $62 million based on a portfolio review of our commercial aftermarket programs in the second quarter of 2020 in consideration of the estimated lower flight hours, a change in  the  estimated  number  of  shop  visits  and  the  related  amount  of  estimated  costs.  Also  included  was  an  unfavorable  EAC adjustment of $44 million in the second quarter of 2020 on a military program primarily driven by a shift in estimated overhead costs due to the lower commercial engine activity discussed above.\n\nThe decrease in other operating profit of $0.2 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to an $89 million impairment of commercial aircraft program assets in the current year and $43 million of reserves related to a commercial financing arrangement in the current year.\n\nDefense Bookings - In addition to a number of smaller bookings, Pratt &amp; Whitney booked the following significant bookings in 2021:  $1.7  billion  for  F135  sustainment  contracts,  $435  million  for  an  F119  sustainment  contract,  $255  million  for  an  F135 production contract and $212 million for F100 engines for an international customer.\n\n## Raytheon Intelligence &amp; Space\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "\nRemaining Performance Obligations  (RPO). RPO  represents  the  aggregate  amount  of  total  contract  transaction  price  that  is unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied. Total RPO was $156 billion as of December 31, 2021. Of the total RPO as of December 31, 2021, we expect approximately 30% will be recognized as sales over the next 12 months. This percentage of RPO to be recognized as sales over the next 12 months depends on our current estimates of future developments, which are highly uncertain, and cannot be  predicted,  including  new  information  which  may  emerge  concerning  the  scope,  severity  and  duration  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic, actions to contain its spread or treat its impact, and governmental, business and individuals' actions taken in response to the pandemic, which may result in customer delays or order cancellations. Approximately 40% of our RPO relates to long-term commercial aerospace maintenance contracts at Pratt &amp; Whitney, which are generally expected to be realized over a span of up to 15 years.\n\nResearch and Development. Company-sponsored research and development costs, including those costs related to the Company's portion  in  connection  with  cost-sharing  arrangements,  are  charged  to  expense  as  incurred  and  recovery  on  these  cost-sharing arrangements  is  recorded  as  a  reduction  to  research  and  development  expense  as  earned.  Customer-sponsored  research  and development projects performed under contracts with customers are accounted for as contract costs and reported as cost of sales on the related revenue generating contracts.\n\nForeign Exchange. We conduct business in many different currencies and, accordingly, are subject to the inherent risks associated with foreign exchange rate movements. The financial position and results of operations of many of our foreign subsidiaries are often  measured  using  the  local  currency  as  the  functional  currency.  Foreign  currency  denominated  assets  and  liabilities  are translated into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rates existing at the respective balance sheet dates, and income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates during the respective periods. The aggregate effects of translating the balance sheets of these subsidiaries are deferred as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) in shareowners' equity. Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses are recorded in Other income, net on our Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n\nDerivatives and Hedging Activity. We use derivative instruments, including swaps, forward contracts and options, to help manage certain foreign currency, and from time to time to help manage interest rate and commodity price exposures. Derivative instruments are  viewed  as  risk  management  tools  by  us  and  are  not  used  for  trading  or  speculative  purposes.  By  their  nature,  all  financial instruments involve market and credit risks. We enter into derivative and other financial instruments with major investment grade financial  institutions  and  have  policies  to  monitor  the  credit  risk  of  those  counterparties.  We  limit  counterparty  exposure  and concentration  of  risk  by  diversifying  counterparties.  While  there  can  be  no  assurance,  we  do  not  anticipate  any  material  nonperformance by any of these counterparties. We enter into transactions that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or  similar  agreements  with  various  counterparties.  However,  we  have  not  elected  to  offset  multiple  contracts  with  a  single counterparty and, as a result, the fair value of the derivative instruments in a loss position is not offset against the fair value of derivative instruments in a gain position.\n\nDerivatives used for hedging purposes may be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract. All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives used to hedge foreign currency denominated balance sheet items are reported directly in earnings along with offsetting transaction gains and losses on the items being  hedged.  Derivatives  used  to  hedge  forecasted  cash  flows  associated  with  foreign  currency  commitments  or  forecasted commodity  purchases  may  be  accounted  for  as  cash  flow  hedges,  as  deemed  appropriate.  Gains  and  losses  on  derivatives designated  as  cash  flow  hedges  are  recorded  in  other  comprehensive  income  and  reclassified  to  earnings  as  a  component  of products sales or expenses, as applicable, when the hedged transaction occurs. Cash payments or receipts on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in Other operating activities, net within the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. To the extent that  a  previously  designated  hedging  transaction  is  no  longer  an  effective  hedge,  any  ineffectiveness  measured  in  the  hedging relationship is recorded currently in earnings in the period it occurs.",

Business Segments and Geographic Information\n\n3M's businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M manages its continuing operations in three business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; and Consumer. 3M's three business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. On April 1, 2024, 3M completed the previously announced separation of its Health Care business as a separate public company, Solventum (see Note 2 for additional information). 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown.\n\n3M discloses business segment operating income (loss) as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income (loss) and income before taxes. Business segment operating income (loss) excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in 'Corporate and Unallocated and Other'). Business segment disclosures consider information used by/provided to 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM). For 3M, the CODM is the chief executive officer. The CODM uses business segment operating income (loss) to allocate resources to segments in the planning and forecasting process along with periodic ongoing reviews of results and overall market activity.\n\n3M made certain changes to the composition of segment information reviewed by 3M's CODM effective in the second quarter of 2024 largely as a result of the separation of Solventum and changes within its business segments effective in the first quarter of 2024. Accordingly, information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all applicable periods presented.\n\nEffective in the second quarter of 2024, this change included the following:\n\nElimination of former Health Care business segment\n\n- The former Health Care business segment was eliminated in the second quarter of 2024 in connection with the separation of Solventum and reflection of its historical net income and applicable assets and liabilities included in the Separation as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements.\n\nAddition of 'Other' and update to 'Corporate and Unallocated'\n\n- 3M added the 'Other' category of information as a result of the Separation. It principally reflects:\n- Transition arrangement agreements (e.g. fees charged by 3M, net of underlying costs) related to divested businesses, including those related to the Separation, as well as other applicable divestitures.\n- Operations of businesses of the former Health Care segment divested prior to the Separation and therefore not reflected as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements, along with limited-duration supply agreements with those previous divestitures.\n- Activity included in 3M's existing 'Corporate and Unallocated' was updated primarily to additionally reflect:\n- Removal of costs related to separating and divesting Solventum that were eligible to be part of discontinued operations.\n- Commercial activity with Solventum post-Separation and certain operations of the former Health Care business segment retained by 3M.\n- Costs previously allocated to Solventum prior to the Separation that were not eligible to be part of discontinued operations other than those beginning in the first quarter of 2024 included in 'Other' associated with transition arrangement activity for which 3M began to charge fees in April 2024.",

Decreases in 2024 were primarily due to ongoing manufacturing productivity, procurement and logistics savings net of inflation, along with lower year-on-year restructuring charges. Increases in 2023 were primarily due to investments in growth, productivity and sustainability; restructuring charges, and carryover impact of higher energy cost inflation partially offset by lower year-on-year net costs for significant litigation to address certain PFAS-related matters at 3M's Zwijndrecht, Belgium site, higher selling prices, spending discipline, sourcing actions and restructuring benefits. See also Certain Expenses Impacting Multiple Line Items within Results of Operations subsection further below.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses: SG&amp;A, measured as a percent of sales, decreased in 2024 when compared to 2023 and increased in 2023 when compared to 2022. Decreases in 2024 were primarily impacted by a $10.3 billion pre-tax charge related to the PWS Settlement and the $4.2 billion pre-tax charge related to the CAE Settlement in the second and third quarters of 2023 respectively (both discussed in Note 19). SG&amp;A in 2024 was also impacted by lower year-on-year restructuring charges. SG&amp;A in 2023 was also impacted by restructuring charges (see Note 6), and continued investment in key growth initiatives. These impacts were partially offset by 2022 net costs for significant litigation to address Combat Arms Earplugs litigation matters (for which a pre-tax  charge of approx imately $1.2 billion was reflected in 2022, discussed in Note 19), certain impairment costs related to ex iting PFAS manufacturing, costs related to ex iting Russia, divestiture-related restructuring charges (see Note 6), restructuring benefits and ongoing general 3M cost management. See also Certain Expenses Impacting Multiple Line Items within Results of Operations subsection further below.\n\nResearch, Development and Related Expenses: R&amp;D, measured as a percent of sales, decreased in 2024 when compared to 2023 and increased in 2023 when compared to 2022. 3M continues to invest in a range of R&amp;D activities from application development, product and manufacturing support, product development and technology development aimed at disruptive innovations. R&amp;D was also impacted by restructuring charges. See also Certain Expenses Impacting Multiple Line Items within Results of Operations subsection further below.\n\nGain on Business Divestitures: In 2023, 3M recorded a pre-tax gain of $36 million related to the sale of assets associated with its dental local anesthetic business net of a previous contingent indemnification obligation from a 2020 divestiture. In 2022, 3M recorded a pre-tax gain of $2.7 billion related to the split-off and combination of its Food Safety business with Neogen Corporation. Refer to Note 4 for further details.\n\nGoodwill Impairment Expense: As a result of 3M's commitment to exit per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) manufacturing, 3M recorded a goodwill impairment charge related to the Advanced Materials reporting unit (within the Transportation and Electronics business) in 2022.",

      "answer": "Boeing identifies FAA-initiated investigation and quality control compliance costs related to the 737-9 production line as potentially having a material impact on its results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows if additional work requirements or more stringent clean-up standards are imposed. Union Pacific, on the other hand, highlights environmental remediation obligations at existing and future sites\u2014including investigation, remediation, and monitoring costs\u2014as likely to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition if actual costs exceed estimates. While Boeing\u2019s regulatory context centers on aviation safety and production oversight by the FAA, Union Pacific faces environmental regulation related to railroad operations under federal, state, and local authorities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, Boeing faces FAA investigations into its quality control system, particularly affecting the 737-9 production line, with potential financial impact due to increased oversight and compliance costs.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, Union Pacific identifies environmental remediation obligations at current and future sites as a material financial risk, with costs potentially exceeding current estimates due to regulatory and environmental uncertainties.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the two by contrasting the nature of their regulatory environments\u2014aviation safety for Boeing versus environmental compliance for Union Pacific\u2014while identifying the common theme of investigation-related costs that could materially affect their financial positions."

Meanwhile, UNP experienced a significant negative return of (18%) on pension plan assets in 2022, which would have increased its net periodic pension benefit cost due to lower asset performance.

In contrast, UNP's 2024 net periodic pension benefit/cost is sensitive to changes in discount rates and expected return on plan assets, with the interest cost and service cost components being measured using individual spot rates matched with cash flows and the expected return being based on asset allocation and historical performance.

      "answer": "BA has entered into indefinite indemnification agreements for pre-closing environmental conditions related to the sale of its Electron Dynamic Devices, Inc., Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power businesses, and BCA facilities in Wichita, Kansas, and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma. These indemnifications expose BA to uncertain future liabilities with no clear maximum estimate due to the inability to predict the number or magnitude of claims. In contrast, UNP records environmental liabilities based on available site-specific data, the financial viability of other potentially responsible parties, and regulatory frameworks, and estimates that its current obligations will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. Additionally, UNP uses actuarial analysis and reinsurance mechanisms to manage its risk exposure, unlike BA, which relies on contingent repurchase commitments and historical claim experience.",

        "Step 1: Extract from BA's 10-K filing - BA has indefinite indemnification agreements tied to environmental conditions from past business sales, with no ability to estimate maximum liability.",

      "question": "How do the aircraft-related capital allocation strategies of FDX and the increase in aircraft deliveries at GE reflect different financial approaches to aviation sector investments in 2024, based on their respective capital commitments and delivery trends?",
      "answer": "FDX plans to invest $1.3 billion in aircraft deliveries and related equipment in 2025, as part of a broader $5.2 billion capital expenditure strategy, signaling a strategic focus on modernizing its fleet with fuel-efficient Boeing 777 and 767 freighters to achieve long-term operating savings. Meanwhile, GE reported a $266 million decrease in sales discounts and allowances primarily due to higher payments from an increase in aircraft deliveries, indicating stronger cash inflows tied to delivery volumes. While both companies are engaged in aviation-related activities, FDX is allocating capital to infrastructure and fleet modernization, whereas GE is seeing improved financial returns from increased delivery volumes. These approaches reflect different strategic focuses: FDX is investing in future efficiency and capacity, while GE is realizing near-term financial benefits from delivery growth.",

          "chunk_text": "Our cash and cash equivalents balance at May 31, 2024 includes $2.5 billion of cash in foreign jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy. We are able to access the majority of this cash without a material tax  cost and do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these funds impairs our ability to meet our U.S. domestic debt or working capital obligations.\n\nOur capital expenditures for 2025 are expected to be approximately $5.2 billion, in line with 2024, as we continue to reduce our capital intensity relative to revenue. Aircraft spend is expected to decline, partially offset by increased investments in network optimization and modernization of our facilities. Our ex pected capital expenditures for 2025 include continued investments related to Network 2.0, as well as the continued modernization of the Federal Express Memphis World Hub and expansion and modernization of the Federal Express Indianapolis Hub. Our expected capital expenditures for 2025 also include $1.3 billion for delivery of aircraft and related equipment and progress payments toward future aircraft deliveries at Federal Express.\n\nWe have several aircraft modernization programs under way that are supported by the purchase of Boeing 777 Freighter and Boeing 767-300 Freighter aircraft. These aircraft are significantly more fuel-efficient per unit than the aircraft types previously utilized, and these ex penditures are necessary to achieve significant long-term operating savings and to replace older aircraft. Our ability to delay the timing of these aircraft-related ex penditures is limited without incurring significant costs to modify existing purchase agreements.\n\nWe have additional obligations as part of our ordinary course of business, beyond those committed for capital expenditures, which consist of debt obligations, lease obligations, and obligations and commitments for purchases of goods and services. Refer to Note 6, Note 7, and Note 18 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information. In addition, we have certain tax positions that are further discussed in Note 12 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We do not have any guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.\n\nWe have a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') that allows us to sell, in one or more future offerings, any combination of our unsecured debt securities and common stock and allows pass-through trusts formed by Federal Express to sell, in one or more future offerings, pass-through certificates.\n\nThe Three-Year Credit Agreement and the Five-Year Credit Agreement expire in March 2027 and March 2029, respectively. Each of the Credit Agreements has a $125 million letter of credit sublimit. The Credit Agreements are available to finance our operations and other cash flow needs. See Note 6 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of the terms and significant covenants of the Credit Agreements.\n\nWe made voluntary contributions of $100 million to our tax-qualified U.S. domestic pension plan ('U.S. Pension Plan') in June 2024 and anticipate making $700 million of additional voluntary contributions during the remainder of 2025. There are currently no required minimum contributions to our U.S. Pension Plan, and we maintain a credit balance related to our cumulative excess voluntary pension contributions over those required that exceeds $3.0 billion. The credit balance is subtracted from plan assets to determine the minimum funding requirements. Therefore, we have the flexibility to eliminate all required contributions to our principal U.S. Pension Plan for several years. Our U.S. Pension Plan has ample funds to meet expected benefit payments.\n\nOn June 10, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.38 per share of common stock. The dividend was paid on July 9, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 24, 2024. Each quarterly dividend payment is subject to review and approval by our Board of Directors, and we evaluate our dividend payment amount on an annual basis. There are no material restrictions on our ability to declare dividends, nor are there any material restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us in the form of cash dividends, loans, or advances.\n\nStandard &amp; Poor's has assigned us a senior unsecured debt credit rating of BBB, a Certificates rating of AA-, a commercial paper rating of A-2, and a ratings outlook of 'stable.' Moody's Investors Service has assigned us an unsecured debt credit rating of Baa2, a Certificates rating of Aa3, a commercial paper rating of P-2, and a ratings outlook of 'stable.' Our interest ex pense may increase in the event of a reduction in our credit rating. If our unsecured debt or commercial paper ratings are reduced to below investment grade, our access to the capital markets may become limited.\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements. In many cases, there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used. We maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements of a complex , global corporation. However, even under optimal circumstances, estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and new or better information.",

SALES DISCOUNTS AND ALLOWANCES &amp; ALL OTHER LIABILITIES.\n\nSales discounts and allowances decreased $266 million in the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to higher payments from an increase in aircraft deliveries, partially  offset by  higher spare part shipments in Commercial Engines &amp; Services.\n\nAll other current liabilities and A ll other liabilities primarily  includes employ ee compensation and benefits, equipment project and commercial liabilities, income taxes payable and uncertain tax positions, environmental, health and safety remediations, operating lease liabilities (see Note 6) and product warranties (see Note 24). A ll other current liabilities increased $60 million in the y ear ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to an increase in dividends payable of $211 million, an increase in other sundry liabilities at Commercial Engines and Services of $136 million, and an increase in equipment projects and other commercial liabilities of $99 million, partially  offset by  a decrease in employ ee compensation and benefits of $355 million. A ll other liabilities increased $620 million in the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to increases in uncertain and other income taxes and related liabilities of $494 million, Environmental, health and safety liabilities of $146 million and indemnity liabilities of $146 million, primarily related to GE V ernova, partially  offset by  a decrease in operating lease liabilities of $109 million.\n\nNOTE 15. INCOME TAXES . GE Aerospace files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return which enables the company to use tax deductions and credits of one member of the group to reduce the tax that otherwise would have been payable by another member of the group. The effective tax rate reflects the benefit of these tax reductions in the consolidated return. Cash payments are made within the company for tax increases or reductions .\n\nOur businesses are subject to a wide variety of U.S. federal, state and foreign tax laws, regulations and policies. Changes to these laws or regulations may affect our tax liability , return on inv estments and business operations. On A ugust 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction A ct that includes a new corporate alternative minimum tax based upon financial statement income (book minimum tax), and an excise tax on stock buybacks, among other provisions. The new book minimum tax is expected to slow but not eliminate the favorable tax impact of our deferred tax assets, resulting in higher cash tax in some years that would generate future tax credits. The impact of the book minimum tax will depend on our facts in each year and final guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n\nThe OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) has proposed a global minimum tax of 15% of reported profits (Pillar 2) that has been agreed upon in principle by over 140 countries. During 2023, many countries took steps to incorporate Pillar 2 model rule concepts into their domestic laws. Although the model rules provide a framework for applying the minimum tax, countries may enact Pillar 2 slightly differently than the model rules and on different timelines and may adjust domestic tax incentives in response to Pillar 2. In addition, in January 2025, the United States issued an executive order announcing opposition to aspects of these rules. A ccordingly, we are still evaluating the potential consequences of Pillar 2 on our longer-term financial position. During 2024, we have incurred insignificant tax expenses in connection with Pillar 2.\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2020, EMR experienced a lower tax rate in part due to a research and development tax credit study, which directly benefited its tax position during that year. In contrast, LMT projected that under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the change in treatment of R&D expenditures\u2014requiring amortization over five years instead of immediate deduction\u2014would decrease its expected cash from operations in 2022 by approximately $500 million if the provision was not deferred, modified, or repealed. This illustrates a direct contrast in how the same tax policy affected two companies in different ways and at different times: EMR benefited retroactively in 2020, while LMT faced a forward-looking negative cash impact in 2022.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Other Non-operating Income (Expense), Net\n\nOther non-operating income (expense), net primarily includes gains or losses related to changes in the fair value of strategic investments in early stage companies made by our Lockheed Martin Ventures Fund. See 'Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Other non-operating income, net in 2021 was $288 million, compared to other non-operating expense, net of $37 million in 2020. The increase in 2021 was primarily due to increases in the fair value of investments held in our Lockheed Martin Ventures Fund.\n\n## Income Tax Expense\n\nOur effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 16.4% for both 2021 and 2020. The rates for both 2021 and 2020 benefited from tax deductions for foreign derived intangible income, the research and development tax credit, dividends paid to the company's  defined  contribution  plans  with  an  employee  stock  ownership  plan  feature  and  tax  deductions  for  employee  equity awards.\n\nChanges in U.S. (federal or state) or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including those with  retroactive  effect,  including  the  amortization  for  research  or  experimental  expenditures,  could  significantly  impact  our provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, our deferred tax asset and liability balances, and stockholders' equity. Recent  proposals  to  increase  the  U.S.  corporate  income  tax  rate  would  require  us  to  increase  our  net  deferred  tax  assets  upon enactment of new tax legislation, with a corresponding material, one-time, noncash decrease in income tax expense, but our income tax expense and payments would likely be materially increased in subsequent years. Our net deferred tax assets were $2.3 billion and $3.5 billion at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, based on a 21% federal statutory income tax rate, and primarily relate  to  our  postretirement  benefit  plans.  In  addition  to  future  changes  in  tax  laws,  the  amount  of  net  deferred  tax  assets  will change periodically based on several factors, including the measurement of our postretirement benefit plan obligations and actual cash contributions to our postretirement benefit plans.\n\nBeginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures immediately in the year incurred and requires taxpayers to amortize such expenditures over five years. While it is possible that Congress  may  defer,  modify,  or  repeal  this  provision,  potentially  with  retroactive  effect,  and  we  continue  to  have  ongoing discussions with members of Congress, both on our own and with other industries through coalitions, we have no assurance that this  provision  will  be  deferred,  modified,  or  repealed.  Furthermore,  in  anticipation  of  the  new  provision  taking  effect,  we  have analyzed the provision and worked with our advisors to evaluate its application to our business. If this provision is not deferred, modified, or repealed with retroactive effect to January 1, 2022, we estimate it will decrease our expected cash from operations in 2022 by approximately $500 million and increase our net deferred tax assets by a similar amount. The actual impact on 2022 cash from operations will depend on if and when this provision is deferred, modified, or repealed by Congress, including if retroactively, and the amount of research and development expenses paid or incurred in 2022 among other factors. While the largest impact will be to 2022 cash from operations, the impact would continue over the five year amortization period, but would decrease over the period and be immaterial in year six.\n\nWe are regularly under audit or examination by tax authorities, including foreign tax authorities (including in, amongst others, Australia,  Canada,  India,  Italy,  Japan,  Poland,  and  the  United  Kingdom).  The  final  determination  of  tax  audits  and  any  related litigation could similarly result in unanticipated increases in our tax expense and affect profitability and cash flows.\n\n## Net Earnings from Continuing Operations\n\nWe reported net earnings from continuing operations of $6.3 billion ($22.76 per share) in 2021 and $6.9 billion ($24.50 per share)  in  2020.  Both  net  earnings  and  earnings  per  share  in  2021  were  affected  by  the  factors  mentioned  above,  including  the noncash pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion ($1.3 billion, or $4.72 per share, after-tax) related to the transfer of $4.9 billion of gross  defined  benefit  pension  obligations  and  related  plan  assets  to  an  insurance  company. Additionally,  both  net  earnings  and earnings per share in 2021 were affected by the $225 million ($169 million, or $0.61 per share, after-tax) loss for performance issues  experienced  on  a  classified  program  at  our Aeronautics  business  segment.  Earnings  per  share  also  benefited  from  a  net decrease of approximately 3.8 million weighted average common shares outstanding in 2021, compared to 2020. Weighted average common shares include share  repurchases,  partially  offset  by  share  issuance  under  our  stock-based  awards  and  certain  defined contribution plans.\n\n## Net Loss from Discontinued Operations\n\nIn 2020, we recognized a $55 million ($0.20 per share) noncash charge resulting from the resolution of certain tax matters related to the former Information Systems &amp; Global Solutions business divested in 2016.",

          "chunk_text": "## INVESTMENT AND DIVESTITURE GAINS\n\nAs previously disclosed, the Company sold its network power systems business (rebranded as Vertiv, now a publicly traded company, symbol VRT) in 2017 and retained a subordinated interest contingent upon the equity holders first receiving a threshold cash return on their initial investment. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the equity holders' cumulative cash return exceeded the threshold and as a result, the Company received a distribution of $438 in November 2021 (in total, a pretax gain of $453 was recognized in the first quarter). Based on the terms of the agreement and the current calculation, the Company could receive additional distributions of approximately $75 which are expected to be received over the next two-to-three years. However, the distributions are contingent on the timing and price at which Vertiv shares are sold by the equity holders and therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of the remaining distributions to the Company.\n\nOn May 31, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its Therm-O-Disc sensing and protection technologies business to an affiliate of One Rock Capital Partners, LLC. The Company recognized a pretax gain of $486 ($429 after-tax, $0.72 per share). See Note 4.\n\n## OTHER DEDUCTIONS, NET\n\nOther deductions, net were $601 in 2022, an increase of $283 compared with 2021, reflecting a charge of $145 related to the Company exiting its business in Russia ($10 of which is reported in restructuring costs), acquisition/divestiture costs of $110, higher intangibles amortization of $57, primarily related to the Heritage AspenTech acquisition, and a mark-to-market loss of $50 related to foreign currency forward contracts entered into by AspenTech to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange associated with the Micromine purchase price. These items were partially offset by lower restructuring costs of $64, gains from the sales of capital assets of $15, and a $14 gain from the acquisition of full ownership of an equity investment. The prior year also had several investment-related gains which are described below. See Notes 5 and 6.\n\nOther deductions, net were $318 in 2021, a decrease of $214 compared with 2020, reflecting lower restructuring costs of $134, investment-related gains, including gains of $21 from an investment sale and $17 from the acquisition of full ownership of an equity investment, and a gain of $31 from the sale of an equity investment, a favorable impact from pensions, and favorable foreign currency transactions of $17. These items were partially offset by higher intangibles amortization of $61, primarily related to the OSI acquisition.\n\n## INTEREST EXPENSE, NET\n\nInterest expense, net was $193, $154 and $156 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in 2022 reflects the issuance of $3 billion of long-term debt in December 2021 to support the AspenTech transaction, partially offset by $500 of notes that matured in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.\n\n## EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES\n\nPretax earnings of $4,085 increased $1,173 in 2022, up 40 percent compared with 2021 reflecting the impact of the Vertiv and Therm-O-Disc gains discussed above. Earnings increased $401 in Automation Solutions, $19 in AspenTech and $76 in Commercial &amp; Residential Solutions. Costs reported at Corporate increased $223, largely due to the Russia business exit loss and acquisition/divestiture costs, offset by lower stock compensation expense of $80. See the Business Segments discussion that follows and Note 18.\n\nPretax earnings of $2,912 increased $577 in 2021, up 25 percent compared with 2020. Earnings increased $416 in Automation Solutions, $9 in AspenTech and $246 in Commercial &amp; Residential Solutions. Costs reported at Corporate increased $96, reflecting higher stock compensation expense of $114 and first year acquisition accounting charges and fees related to the OSI acquisition of $50, partially offset by the investment-related gains discussed above and lower unallocated pension and postretirement costs which decreased by $41.\n\n## INCOME TAXES\n\nIncome taxes were $855, $585 and $345 for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, resulting in effective tax rates of 21 percent, 20 percent and 15 percent in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nThe tax rates for 2022, 2021 and 2020 include benefits from restructuring subsidiaries of $11, $13 and $103, respectively. The impact on the 2022 tax rate from the gain on divestiture of the Therm-O-Disc business and the Russia business exit in 2022 essentially offset. The lower rate in 2020 included the impact of a research and development tax credit study. See Note 14.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Other Non-operating Income (Expense), Net\n\nOther non-operating income (expense), net primarily includes gains or losses related to changes in the fair value of strategic investments in early stage companies made by our Lockheed Martin Ventures Fund. See 'Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Other non-operating income, net in 2021 was $288 million, compared to other non-operating expense, net of $37 million in 2020. The increase in 2021 was primarily due to increases in the fair value of investments held in our Lockheed Martin Ventures Fund.\n\n## Income Tax Expense\n\nOur effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 16.4% for both 2021 and 2020. The rates for both 2021 and 2020 benefited from tax deductions for foreign derived intangible income, the research and development tax credit, dividends paid to the company's  defined  contribution  plans  with  an  employee  stock  ownership  plan  feature  and  tax  deductions  for  employee  equity awards.\n\nChanges in U.S. (federal or state) or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including those with  retroactive  effect,  including  the  amortization  for  research  or  experimental  expenditures,  could  significantly  impact  our provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, our deferred tax asset and liability balances, and stockholders' equity. Recent  proposals  to  increase  the  U.S.  corporate  income  tax  rate  would  require  us  to  increase  our  net  deferred  tax  assets  upon enactment of new tax legislation, with a corresponding material, one-time, noncash decrease in income tax expense, but our income tax expense and payments would likely be materially increased in subsequent years. Our net deferred tax assets were $2.3 billion and $3.5 billion at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, based on a 21% federal statutory income tax rate, and primarily relate  to  our  postretirement  benefit  plans.  In  addition  to  future  changes  in  tax  laws,  the  amount  of  net  deferred  tax  assets  will change periodically based on several factors, including the measurement of our postretirement benefit plan obligations and actual cash contributions to our postretirement benefit plans.\n\nBeginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures immediately in the year incurred and requires taxpayers to amortize such expenditures over five years. While it is possible that Congress  may  defer,  modify,  or  repeal  this  provision,  potentially  with  retroactive  effect,  and  we  continue  to  have  ongoing discussions with members of Congress, both on our own and with other industries through coalitions, we have no assurance that this  provision  will  be  deferred,  modified,  or  repealed.  Furthermore,  in  anticipation  of  the  new  provision  taking  effect,  we  have analyzed the provision and worked with our advisors to evaluate its application to our business. If this provision is not deferred, modified, or repealed with retroactive effect to January 1, 2022, we estimate it will decrease our expected cash from operations in 2022 by approximately $500 million and increase our net deferred tax assets by a similar amount. The actual impact on 2022 cash from operations will depend on if and when this provision is deferred, modified, or repealed by Congress, including if retroactively, and the amount of research and development expenses paid or incurred in 2022 among other factors. While the largest impact will be to 2022 cash from operations, the impact would continue over the five year amortization period, but would decrease over the period and be immaterial in year six.\n\nWe are regularly under audit or examination by tax authorities, including foreign tax authorities (including in, amongst others, Australia,  Canada,  India,  Italy,  Japan,  Poland,  and  the  United  Kingdom).  The  final  determination  of  tax  audits  and  any  related litigation could similarly result in unanticipated increases in our tax expense and affect profitability and cash flows.\n\n## Net Earnings from Continuing Operations\n\nWe reported net earnings from continuing operations of $6.3 billion ($22.76 per share) in 2021 and $6.9 billion ($24.50 per share)  in  2020.  Both  net  earnings  and  earnings  per  share  in  2021  were  affected  by  the  factors  mentioned  above,  including  the noncash pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion ($1.3 billion, or $4.72 per share, after-tax) related to the transfer of $4.9 billion of gross  defined  benefit  pension  obligations  and  related  plan  assets  to  an  insurance  company. Additionally,  both  net  earnings  and earnings per share in 2021 were affected by the $225 million ($169 million, or $0.61 per share, after-tax) loss for performance issues  experienced  on  a  classified  program  at  our Aeronautics  business  segment.  Earnings  per  share  also  benefited  from  a  net decrease of approximately 3.8 million weighted average common shares outstanding in 2021, compared to 2020. Weighted average common shares include share  repurchases,  partially  offset  by  share  issuance  under  our  stock-based  awards  and  certain  defined contribution plans.\n\n## Net Loss from Discontinued Operations\n\nIn 2020, we recognized a $55 million ($0.20 per share) noncash charge resulting from the resolution of certain tax matters related to the former Information Systems &amp; Global Solutions business divested in 2016.",

The discount rates utilized in the DCF analysis are based on the respective reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. The carrying value of each reporting unit includes the assets and liabilities employed in its operations, goodwill and allocations of certain assets and liabilities held at the business segment and corporate levels.\n\nDuring  the  fourth  quarters  of  2021,  2020  and  2019,  we  performed  our  annual  goodwill  impairment  test  for  each  of  our reporting units. The results of our annual impairment tests of goodwill indicated that no impairment existed.\n\nAcquired intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment testing. This testing  compares carrying value to fair value and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. Finite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over the applicable useful lives, ranging from five to 20 years, based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic benefit as reflected by future net cash inflows. We perform an impairment test of finite-lived intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may be impaired.\n\nLeases - We evaluate whether our contractual arrangements contain leases at the inception of such arrangements. Specifically, we consider whether we can control the underlying asset and have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits or outputs from the asset. Substantially all of our leases are long-term operating leases with fixed payment terms. We do not have significant financing leases. Our right-of-use (ROU) operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease  term,  and  our  operating  lease  liabilities  represent  our  obligation  to  make  lease  payments.  ROU  operating  lease  assets  are recorded  in  other  noncurrent  assets  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheet.  Operating  lease  liabilities  are  recorded  in  other  current liabilities or other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet based on their contractual due dates.\n\nBoth the ROU operating lease asset and liability are recognized as of the lease commencement date at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. Most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate that can readily be determined. Therefore, we use a discount rate based on our incremental borrowing rate, which is determined using our credit rating and information available as of the commencement date. ROU operating lease assets include lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, net of any lease incentives.\n\nOur operating lease agreements may include options to extend the lease term or terminate it early. We include options to extend or  terminate  leases  in  the  ROU  operating  lease  asset  and  liability  when  it  is  reasonably  certain  we  will  exercise  these  options. Operating  lease  expense  is  recognized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  lease  term  and  is  included  in  cost  of  sales  on  our consolidated statement of earnings.\n\nWe have operating lease arrangements with lease and non-lease components. The non-lease components in our arrangements are  not  significant  when  compared  to  the  lease  components.  For  all  operating  leases,  we  account  for  the  lease  and  non-lease components as a single component. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to recognize operating lease ROU assets and liabilities. We evaluate ROU assets for impairment consistent with our property, plant and equipment policy.\n\nPostretirement  benefit  plans -  Many  of  our  employees  and  retirees  participate  in  defined  benefit  pension  plans,  retiree medical and life insurance plans, and other postemployment plans (collectively, postretirement benefit plans). GAAP requires that the amounts we record related to our postretirement benefit plans be computed, based on service to date, using actuarial valuations that are based in part on certain key economic assumptions we make, including the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity (also known as mortality), health care cost trend rates and employee turnover, each as appropriate based on the nature of the plans.\n\nA market-related value of our plan assets, determined using actual asset gains or losses over the prior three year period, is used to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. These asset gains or losses, along with those resulting from adjustments to our benefit obligation, will be amortized to expense using the corridor method, where gains and losses are recognized over a period of years to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater of plan assets or benefit obligations.\n\nWe recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans as either an asset recorded within other noncurrent assets or a liability recorded within noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The GAAP funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan's assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. The funded status under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended, is calculated on a different basis than under GAAP.",

Through its leading automation portfolio, Emerson helps process, hybrid and discrete manufacturers optimize operations, protect personnel, reduce emissions and achiev e their sustainability goals. Sales by geographic destination in 2024 were: the Americas, 50 percent; Asia, Middle East &amp; Africa, 30 percent (China, 11 percent); and Europe, 20 percent.\n\nPortfolio management is an integral component of Emerson's growth and v alue creation strategy. Ov er the past three years, the Company has taken significant actions to accelerate the transformation of its portfolio through the completion of strategic acquisitions and div estitures of non-core businesses. These actions were undertaken to create a cohesiv e, higher growth and higher margin industrial technology portfolio as a global automation leader serv ing a div ersified set of end markets. The Company's recent portfolio actions include the following transactions (note that all dollars in Item 1 are in millions, except where noted):\n\n- On October 11, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of National Instruments Corporation (\"NI\") at an equity v alue of $8.2 billion. NI, which prov ides software-connected automated test and measurement systems that enable enterprises to bring products to market faster and at a lower cost, had rev enues of approximately $1.7 billion and pretax earnings of approximately $170 for the 12 months ended September 30, 2023.\n- On May 31, 2023, the Company completed the sale of a majority stake in its Climate Technologies business (which constitutes the former Climate Technologies segment, excluding Therm-O-Disc which was div ested earlier in 2022; the new standalone business is named Copeland) to priv ate equity funds managed by Blackstone in a $14.0 billion transaction. Emerson receiv ed upfront, pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately $9.7 billion and a note receiv able with a face v alue of $2.25 billion, while retaining a 40 percent non-controlling common equity interest in a new standalone joint v enture between Emerson and Blackstone. Subsequently, in August 2024, Emerson sold its 40 percent non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland to priv ate equity funds managed by Blackstone for $1.5 billion and sold the note receiv able to Copeland for $1.9 billion.\n- On October 31, 2022, the Company completed the div estiture of its InSinkErator business, which manufactures food waste disposers, to Whirlpool Corporation for $3.0 billion.\n- On May 31, 2022 the Company completed the divestiture of its Therm-O-Disc sensing and protection technologies business to an affiliate of One Rock Capital Partners, LLC.\n- On May 16, 2022, the Company completed the transactions contemplated by its definitiv e agreement with Aspen Technology, Inc. (\"Heritage AspenTech\") to contribute two of Emerson's stand-alone industrial software businesses, Open Systems International, Inc. and the Geological Simulation Software business (collectiv ely, the 'Emerson Industrial Software Business'), along with approximately $6.0 billion in cash to Heritage AspenTech stockholders, to create \"New AspenTech\", a div ersified, high-performance industrial software leader with greater scale, capabilities and technologies (defined as \"AspenTech\" herein). Upon closing of the transaction, Emerson owned 55 percent of the outstanding shares of AspenTech common stock (on a fully diluted basis). AspenTech had 2023 net sales of $1.04 billion.\n- On November 5, 2024, the Company announced a proposal to acquire all outstanding shares of common stock of AspenTech not already owned by Emerson for $240 per share in cash, which implies a fully diluted market capitalization for AspenTech of $15.3 billion and an enterprise v alue of $15.1 billion. The Company currently owns approximately 57 percent of AspenTech's outstanding shares of common stock. The proposal is not subject to any financing condition and would be financed from cash on hand, committed lines of credit and/or other av ailable sources of financing. Also on Nov ember 5, 2024, the Company announced that it is exploring strategic alternativ es, including a cash sale, for its Safety &amp; Productiv ity segment. No assurance can be giv en whether the proposal or the rev iew will lead to one or more transactions or as to any of the terms or conditions of such transactions.

EMR's unbilled receivables can be calculated as $400 million, based on the fact that EMR reclassifies unbilled receivables to accounts receivable when an unconditional right to consideration exists, typically upon achievement of a milestone in the contract, and the total accounts receivable for EMR is stated to include these reclassified amounts. Both companies recognize revenue over time for long-term contracts, which leads to unbilled receivables when revenue recognized exceeds billings. EMR uses an input method based on costs incurred, while RTX recognizes unbilled receivables as revenues that are not currently billable to the customer under the terms of the contract, including amounts where payment is solely subject to the passage of time.",

          "chunk_text": "items in contracts with multiple performance obligations or where rev enue is recognized ov er time, while a smaller portion is attributable to installation, serv ice and maintenance.\n\nFor projects where rev enue is recognized ov er time, the Company typically uses an input method to determine progress and recognize rev enue, based on costs incurred. The Company believ es costs incurred closely correspond with its performance under the contract and the transfer of control to the customer. For software maintenance contracts, rev enue is recognized ratably ov er the maintenance term.\n\nIn sales arrangements that inv olv e multiple performance obligations, rev enue is allocated based on the relativ e standalone selling price for each performance obligation. Observ able selling prices from actual transactions are used whenev er possible. In other instances, the Company determines the standalone selling price based on third-party pricing or management's best estimate. Generally, contract duration is short-term, and cancellation, termination or refund prov isions apply only in the ev ent of contract breach and are rarely inv oked.\n\nPayment terms vary but are generally short-term in nature. The Company's long-term contracts, where rev enue is generally recognized ov er time, are typically billed as work progresses in accordance with the contract terms and conditions, either at periodic interv als or upon achiev ement of certain milestones. The timing of rev enue recognition and billings under these contracts results in either unbilled receiv ables (contract assets) when rev enue recognized exceeds billings, or customer adv ances (contract liabilities) when billings exceed rev enue recognized. Unbilled receiv ables are reclassified to accounts receiv able when an unconditional right to consideration exists, typically when a milestone in the contract is achiev ed. The Company does not evaluate whether the transaction price includes a significant financing component for contracts where the time between cash collection and performance is less than one year.\n\nCertain arrangements with customers include v ariable consideration, typically in the form of rebates, cash discounts or penalties. In limited circumstances, the Company sells products with a general right of return. In most instances, returns are limited to product quality issues. The Company records a reduction to rev enue at the time of sale to reflect the ultimate amount of consideration it expects to receiv e. The Company's estimates are updated quarterly based on historical experience, trend analysis, and expected market conditions. Variable consideration is typically not constrained at the time rev enue is recognized. See Notes 2 and 20 for additional information about the Company's rev enues.\n\n## Derivatives and Hedging\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates due to its worldwide presence and div erse business profile. The Company's foreign currency exposures relate to transactions denominated in currencies that differ from the functional currencies of its business units, primarily in euros, Mexican pesos, and Chinese yuan. As part of the Company's risk management strategy, deriv ativ e instruments are selectiv ely used in an effort to minimize the impact of these exposures. Foreign exchange forwards and options are utilized to hedge foreign currency exposures impacting sales or cost of sales transactions, firm commitments and the fair v alue of assets and liabilities. Non-U.S. dollar obligations are utilized to reduce foreign currency risk associated with the Company's net inv estments in foreign operations. All deriv ativ es are associated with specific underlying exposures and the Company does not hold deriv ativ es for trading or speculativ e purposes. The duration of hedge positions is generally two years or less, except for the Company's net inv estment hedges.\n\nAll deriv ativ es are accounted for under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , and recognized at fair v alue. For deriv ativ es hedging v ariability in future cash flows, any gain or loss is deferred in stockholders' equity and recognized when the underlying hedged transaction impacts earnings. The majority of the Company's derivativ es that are designated as hedges and qualify for hedge accounting are cash flow hedges. For deriv ativ es hedging the fair v alue of existing assets or liabilities, both the gain or loss on the deriv ativ e and the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item are recognized in earnings each period. Currency fluctuations on non-U.S. dollar obligations that hav e been designated as hedges of net inv estments in foreign operations are recognized in accumulated other comprehensiv e income (loss) and reclassified to income in the same period when a foreign operation is sold or substantially liquidated and the gain or loss related to the sale is included in income. To the extent that any hedge is not fully effectiv e at offsetting changes in the underlying hedged item, there could be a net earnings impact.\n\nThe Company also uses deriv ativ es to hedge economic exposures that do not receiv e hedge accounting under ASC 815. The underlying exposures for these hedges relate primarily to the rev aluation of certain foreign-currency-denominated assets and liabilities.

These charges are primarily related to the recognition of unfavorable purchase commitments and an impairment of contract fulfillment costs that are no longer recoverable as a result of initiating alternative titanium sources.

We continue to monitor developments, including additional sanctions and other measures, that could adversely affect the Company and/or our supply chain, business partners, or customers.\n\nPratt &amp; Whitney Powder Metal Matter. In 2023, Pratt &amp; Whitney determined that a rare condition in powder metal used to manufacture certain engine parts requires accelerated inspection of the PW1100G -JM (PW1100) G eared Turbofan (GTF) fleet, which powers the A320neo family of aircraft (A320neo) (herein referred to as the 'Powder Metal Matter'). See 'Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies' for additional information.\n\nSummary of Accounting Principles. The following represents the significant accounting principles of RTX Corporation.\n\nConsolidation and Classification. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of RTX Corporation, and all wholly owned, majority-owned, and otherwise controlled domestic and foreign subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. For our consolidated non-wholly owned subsidiaries, a noncontrolling interest is recognized to reflect the portion of income and equity that is not attributable to us. For classification of certain current assets and liabilities, the duration of our contracts or programs is utilized to define our operating cycle, which is generally longer than one year. Included within our current assets and liabilities are Contract assets and Contract liabilities related to our development and aftermarket arrangements, which can generally span up to twenty years.\n\nUse of Estimates. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are based on the application of U.S. G enerally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results  could  differ  from  those  estimates,  and  any  such  differences  may  be  material  to  our  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  Estimates  and  assumptions  are reviewed periodically and the effects of changes, if any, are reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements in the period they are determined.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, demand deposits, and short-term cash investments that are highly liquid in nature and have original maturities of three months or less. The estimated fair value of Cash and cash equivalents approximates the carrying value due to their short maturities.\n\nAccounts Receivable. Accounts receivable are stated at the net amount expected to be collected. Accounts receivable related to the commercial aerospace industry was approximately 79% and 80% of Accounts receivable, net at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We are exposed to credit losses primarily on our accounts receivable and contract assets related to our sales of products and services to commercial customers. The allowance for expected credit losses is established to provide for the expected lifetime credit losses by evaluating factors such as customer creditworthiness, historical payment and loss experiences, current economic conditions,  including  geographic  and  political  risk,  and  the  age  and  status  of  outstanding  receivables.  In  certain  circumstances,  we  may  be  able  to  develop reasonable and supportable forecasts over the contractual term of the financial asset. For periods beyond which we are able to make or obtain reasonable and supportable forecasts, we revert to historical loss ex perience and information.\n\nWe determine credit ratings for each customer in our portfolio based upon public information and information obtained directly from our customers. We conduct a review of customer credit ratings, published historical credit default rates for different rating categories, and multiple third-party aircraft value publications as a basis to  validate  the  reasonableness  of  the  allowance  for  ex pected  credit  losses  on  a  quarterly  basis,  or  when  events  and  circumstances  warrant. A  credit  limit  is established for each customer based on the outcome of this review and consideration of the other factors discussed above. In certain cases, we may require collateral or prepayment to mitigate credit risk.\n\nExpected credit losses are written off in the period in which the financial asset is no longer collectible.\n\nUnbilled receivables represent revenues that are not currently billable to the customer under the terms of the contract and include unbilled amounts under commercial contracts where payment is solely subject to the passage of time. These items are expected to be billed and collected in the normal course of business. Accounts receivable,  net  as  of  December  31,  2024  and  2023  includes  unbilled  receivables  of  $374  million  and  $427  million,  respectively,  which  primarily  includes  unbilled receivables with commercial aerospace customers. Other unbilled receivables where payment is subject to factors beyond just the passage of time are included in Contract assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.",

In contrast, RTX explicitly identifies 'investments in and divestitures of businesses' as a principal factor in liquidity management, showing a strategic emphasis on divestitures to fund operating, investing, and financing activities.

      "question": "How does the net earnings decline in EMR's Climate Technologies segment from 2023 to 2024 compare with RTX's exposure to climate-related regulatory risks, and what might this imply about their relative strategic positioning in the segment?",
      "answer": "EMR's Climate Technologies segment experienced a significant decline in net earnings from $8,809 million in 2023 to $350 million in 2024, a drop of $8,459 million. This sharp decline suggests challenges or strategic shifts, such as divestitures or operational changes, within the segment. Meanwhile, RTX's 10-K filing explicitly highlights exposure to climate-related regulatory risks, including compliance with evolving environmental requirements and changing climate-related technologies. Given RTX's acknowledgment of these risks and EMR's financial downturn in the same segment, RTX may face heightened challenges in achieving or maintaining profitability in climate technologies, especially if regulatory pressures intensify. This contrast implies that EMR may be scaling back or restructuring its position in the segment, while RTX continues to navigate uncertainties in the regulatory and market landscape.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - EMR's Climate Technologies segment net earnings dropped from $8,809 million in 2023 to $350 million in 2024.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - RTX faces risks related to compliance with environmental regulations and uncertainty around climate-related technologies.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The significant drop in EMR's segment earnings and RTX's regulatory risk exposure suggest a challenging landscape for companies operating in climate technologies, with EMR's decline potentially signaling broader sector difficulties that RTX must manage against."

      "answer": "UNP's average debt of $28,229 million in 2021 is a key component of its total average invested capital of $45,471 million as adjusted in 2022. This average invested capital is calculated as the sum of average debt, average equity, and average operating lease liabilities. UNP's Net Operating Profit After Taxes (NOPAT) as adjusted was $7,454 million. The ROIC of 16.4% is derived by dividing NOPAT by the average invested capital, showing that the significant level of debt increases the capital base, which can dilute ROIC unless offset by higher returns.",

In contrast, Union Pacific follows a policy aligned with GAAP, where the funded status of the plans\u2014measured as the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets\u2014determines the asset or liability recognition, suggesting a more regulatory and balance sheet-driven funding approach.",

The  principal  factors  affecting  the  benefits  earned  by participants in our pension plans are employees' years of service and compensation levels. Our primary U.S. pension plans, which comprise the majority of our unfunded obligation, were closed to new salaried participants on January 1, 2007, and were closed to new hourly participants in subsequent collective bargaining agreements over the next several years. Additionally, we have made several changes to these plans for certain participants that limit or cease the benefits that accrue for future service.\n\nIn addition to pension benefits, we maintain plans that provide post-retirement healthcare and life insurance coverage for certain employees and retirees. These benefits vary by employment status, age, service and salary level at retirement. The coverage provided and the extent to which the retirees share in the cost of the program vary throughout the company. The plans provide health and life insurance benefits only to those employees who retire directly from our service and not to those who terminate service prior to eligibility for retirement.\n\nContributions. It  is  our  policy  to  fund  our  qualified  pension  plans  in  a  manner  that  optimizes  the  tax deductibility  and  contract  recovery  of  contributions  considered  within  our  capital  deployment  framework. Therefore,  we  may  make  discretionary  contributions  in  addition  to  the  required  contributions  determined  in accordance  with  IRS  regulations. We  contributed  $135  to  our  qualified  pension  plans  in  2021.  In  2022,  our required contributions are approximately $40.\n\nWe  maintain  several  tax-advantaged  accounts,  primarily  Voluntary  Employees'  Beneficiary  Association (VEBA) trusts,  to  fund  the  obligations  for  some  of  our  other  post-retirement  benefit  plans.  For  non-funded plans, claims are paid as received. Contributions to our other post-retirement benefit plans were not material in 2021 and are not expected to be material in 2022.\n\nBenefit Payments.

Retirement Plans\n\n## Pension Benefits\n\nWe provide defined benefit retirement income to eligible non-union employees through qualified and non-qualified (supplemental) pension plans. Qualified and non-qualified pension benefits are based on years of service and the highest compensation during the latest years of employment, with specific reductions made for early retirements. Non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2018, are no longer eligible for pension benefits, but are eligible for an enhanced 401(k) benefit as described below in other retirement programs.\n\n## Funded Status\n\nWe are required by GAAP to separately recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our pension plans as an asset or liability. The funded status represents the difference between the projected benefit obligation (PBO) and the fair value of the plan assets. Our non-qualified (supplemental) pension plan is unfunded by design. The PBO of the pension plans is the present value of benefits earned to date by plan participants, including the effect of assumed future compensation increases.

In contrast, UNP emphasizes that ROIC is used as a key performance metric for evaluating long-term capital investments and is specifically incorporated into the determination of equity compensation for executives. This suggests UNP places increasing strategic importance on ROIC as a performance incentive, even as GD's ROIC has decreased over the same timeframe.",

Th e primary drivers of the increase in service operating costs were the changes in volum e on the program s described above.\n\n## G&amp;A EXPENSES\n\nAs a percentage of revenue, G&amp;A expenses decreased to 5.4% in 2024 compared with 5.7% in 2023 due to growth in revenue. W e expect G&amp;A expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2025 to be generally consistent with 2024.\n\n## OTHER, NET\n\nNet other income was $68 in 2024 and $82 in 2023 and represents primarily the non-service com ponents of pension and other post-retirem ent benefits. In 2025, we expect net other incom e to be approxim ately $50.\n\n## INTEREST, NET\n\nNet interest expense was $324 in 2024 and $343 in 2023.

For further discussion, including a reconciliation of our effective tax rate from  the statutory  federal  rate,  see  Note  D  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statem ents  in  Item   8.  For  2025,  we  expect  a  full-year  effective  tax  rate  of approximately 17.5%, generally consistent with our original expectations for 2024 before declining due to certain U.S. and foreign tax credits and benefits and other tim ing item s.\n\n## BACKLOG AND ESTIMATED POTENTIAL CONTRACT VALUE\n\nOur total backlog, including funded and unfunded portions, was $90.6 billion on Decem ber 31, 2024, com pared to $93.6 billion at the end of 2023.

          "chunk_text": "under an income approach that discounts estimated future cash flows using risk-adjusted interest rates, as well as earnings multiples or other techniques as warranted. Fair v alues are subject to changes in underlying economic conditions.\n\nWith the exception of certain trade names, all of the Company's identifiable intangible assets are subject to amortization on a straight-line basis ov er their estimated useful liv es. Identifiable intangibles consist of intellectual property such as technology, patents and trademarks, customer relationships and capitalized software. Identifiable intangibles are also subject to ev aluation for potential impairment if ev ents or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. See Note 10.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe Company leases offices; manufacturing facilities and equipment; and transportation, information technology and office equipment under operating lease arrangements. Finance lease arrangements are immaterial. The Company determines whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at contract inception. An arrangement contains a lease if the Company has the right to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of an identified asset. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at lease commencement based on the present v alue of lease payments ov er the lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet and are recorded as short-term lease expense. The discount rate used to calculate present v alue is the Company's incremental borrowing rate based on the lease term and the economic env ironment of the applicable country or region.\n\nCertain leases contain renewal options or options to terminate prior to lease expiration, which are included in the measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities when it is reasonably certain they will be exercised. The Company has elected to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for its offices and manufacturing facilities. Some lease arrangements include payments that are adjusted periodically based on actual charges incurred for common area maintenance, utilities, taxes and insurance, or changes in an index or rate referenced in the lease. The fixed portion of these payments is included in the measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at lease commencement, while the v ariable portion is recorded as v ariable lease expense. The Company's leases typically do not contain material residual v alue guarantees or restrictiv e cov enants.\n\n## Product Warranty\n\nWarranties v ary by product line and are competitiv e for the markets in which the Company operates. Warranties are largely offered to prov ide assurance that the product will function as intended and generally extend for a period of one to two years from the date of sale or installation. Prov isions for warranty expense are estimated at the time of sale based on historical experience and adjusted quarterly for any known issues that may arise. Product warranty expense is less than one-half of one percent of sales.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nEmerson is a global manufacturer that designs and manufactures products and deliv ers serv ices that bring technology and engineering together to prov ide innov ativ e solutions for its customers. The Company ev aluates its contracts with customers to identify the promised goods or serv ices and recognizes rev enue for the identified performance obligations at the amount the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or serv ices. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or serv ice to a customer. Rev enue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied and control has transferred to the customer, typically when products are shipped or deliv ered, title and risk of loss pass to the customer, and the Company has a present right to payment. The majority of the Company's rev enues relate to a broad offering of manufactured products and software which are recognized at the point in time when control transfers, generally in accordance with shipping terms, or the first day of the contractual term for software. A portion of the Company's rev enues relate to the sale of post-contract customer support, parts and labor for repairs, and engineering serv ices. In some circumstances, contracts include multiple performance obligations, where rev enue is recognized separately for each good or serv ice, as well as contracts where rev enue is recognized ov er time as control transfers to the customer.\n\nRevenue is recognized ov er time for approximately 10 percent of the Company's rev enues. These rev enues primarily relate to projects in the Control Systems &amp; Software segment where revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method to reflect the transfer of control ov er time, and software maintenance contracts in the Software and Control business group where rev enue is typically recognized on a straight-line basis. Approximately 15 percent of rev enues relate to sales arrangements with multiple performance obligations, principally in the Software and Control business group. Tangible products represent a large majority of the deliv ered",

We  define  ME&amp;T  free  cash  flow  as  cash  from  ME&amp;T  operations  less  capital expenditures,  excluding  discretionary  pension  and  other  postretirement  benefit  plan  contributions.  A  goal  of  our  capital  allocation  strategy  is  to  return substantially all ME&amp;T free cash flow to shareholders over time in the form of dividends and share repurchases, while maintaining our mid-A rating.\n\nEach quarter, our Board of Directors reviews the company's dividend for the applicable quarter. The Board evaluates the financial condition of the company and considers corporate cash flow, the company's liquidity needs, the economic outlook, and the health and stability of global credit markets to determine whether to maintain or change the quarterly dividend. In December 2024, the Board of Directors approved maintaining our quarterly dividend representing $1.41 per share, and we continue to expect our strong financial position to support the dividend. Dividends paid totaled $2.65 billion in 2024.\n\nOur share repurchase plans are subject to the company's cash deployment priorities and are evaluated on an ongoing basis considering the financial condition of the company, corporate cash flow, the company's liquidity needs, the economic outlook, and the health and stability of global credit markets. The timing and amount  of  future  repurchases  may  vary  depending  on  market  conditions  and  investing  priorities.  In  May  2022,  the  Board  approved  a  share  repurchase authorization (the 2022 Authorization) of up to $15.0 billion of Caterpillar common stock effective August 1, 2022 with no expiration.  In June 2024, the Board approved an additional share repurchase authorization (the 2024 Authorization) of up to $20.0 billion of Caterpillar common stock, effective June 12, 2024, with no expiration. In 2024, we repurchased $7.7 billion of Caterpillar common stock, with $20.1 billion remaining under the 2022 and 2024 Authorizations as of December 31, 2024. Caterpillar's basic shares outstanding as of December 31, 2024 were approximately 478 million.\n\n## Financial Products\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1.45 billion in 2024, compared with $1.11 billion in 2023. Net cash used for investing activities was $2.79 billion in 2024, compared with $1.42 billion used in 2023. The change was primarily due to portfolio related activity and the divestiture of a non-U.S. entity. Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.21 billion in 2024, compared with net cash provided of $278 million in 2023. The change was primarily due to higher net inflows from external borrowings partially offset by higher dividends paid to Caterpillar in 2024.\n\n## Off-balance sheet arrangements\n\nWe are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements, primarily in the form of guarantees. Information related to guarantees appears in Note 21 - 'G uarantees and product warranty' of Part II, Item 8 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\n## RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\nFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1J - 'New accounting guidance' of Part II, Item 8 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The more significant estimates include: residual values for leased assets, fair values for goodwill impairment tests, warranty liability, reserves for product liability and insurance losses, postretirement benefits, post-sale discounts, credit losses and income taxes. We have incorporated many years of data into the determination of each of these estimates and we have not historically experienced significant adjustments. We review these assumptions at least annually with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Following are the methods and assumptions used in determining our estimates and an indication of the risks inherent in each.\n\nResidual values for leased assets - We determine the residual value of Cat Financial's leased equipment based on its estimated end-of-term market value. We estimate the residual value of leased equipment at the inception of the lease based on a number of factors, including historical wholesale market sales prices, past remarketing experience and any known significant",

Our business is capital intensive, with approx imately 60% of our owned assets invested in our transportation and information system infrastructures.\n\nThe depreciation or amortization of our capital assets over their estimated useful lives, and the determination of any salvage values, requires management to make judgments about future events. Because we utilize many of our capital assets over relatively long periods (the majority of aircraft costs are depreciated over 18 to 30 years), we periodically evaluate whether adjustments to our estimated service lives or salvage values are necessary to ensure these estimates properly match the economic use of the asset. These evaluations consider usage, maintenance costs, and economic factors that affect the useful life of an asset. This evaluation may result in changes in the estimated lives and residual values used to depreciate our aircraft and other equipment.",

FedEx, on the other hand, evaluates salvage values as part of depreciation for long-lived assets like aircraft, adjusting estimated service lives or residual values based on usage, maintenance costs, and economic factors. This means Caterpillar\u2019s adjustments directly affect either depreciation or revenue depending on lease type, whereas FedEx\u2019s changes impact the depreciation schedule of capital assets over time.",

Cat Financial leases to customers primarily through sales-type (non-tax) leases, where the lessee for tax purposes is considered to be the owner of the equipment during the term of the lease. Cat Financial also offers tax  leases that are classified as either operating or direct finance leases for financial accounting purposes, depending on the characteristics of the lease. For tax  purposes, Cat Financial is considered the owner of the equipment. Our lease agreements may include options for the lessee to purchase the underlying asset at the end of the lease term for either a stated fix ed price or fair market value.\n\nWe determine the residual value of Cat Financial's leased equipment based on its estimated end-of-term market value.  We estimate the residual value of leased equipment at the inception of the lease based on a number of factors, including historical wholesale market sales prices, past remarketing experience and any known significant market/product trends.  We also consider the following critical factors in our residual value estimates: lease term, market size and demand, total ex pected hours of usage, machine configuration, application, location, model changes, quantities, third-party residual guarantees and contractual customer purchase options.\n\nDuring the term of our leases, we monitor residual values.  For operating leases, we record adjustments to depreciation expense reflecting changes in residual value estimates prospectively on a straight-line basis.  For finance leases, we recognize residual value adjustments through a reduction of finance revenue over the remaining lease term.\n\nSee Note 7 for contractual maturities of finance lease receivables (sales-type and direct finance leases).\n\nThe carrying amount of equipment leased to others, included in Property, plant and equipment - net in Statement 3, under operating leases was as follows:",

      "answer": "A 10% non-temporary decrease in residual value estimates for Caterpillar's equipment on operating leases would result in approximately $70 million of additional annual depreciation expense. FedEx, as a capital-intensive company with approximately 60% of its owned assets in transportation and information system infrastructures, periodically evaluates salvage values and estimated service lives of long-lived assets. This evaluation considers usage, maintenance costs, and economic factors that affect the useful life of an asset.

We also consider the following critical factors in our residual value estimates: lease term, market size and demand, total expected hours of usage, machine configuration, application, location, model changes, quantities, third-party residual guarantees and contractual customer purchase options.\n\nUpon termination of the lease, the equipment is either purchased by the lessee or sold to a third-party, in which case we may record a gain or a loss for the difference between the estimated residual value and the sale proceeds.\n\nDuring the term of our leases, we monitor residual values.  For operating leases, we record adjustments to depreciation expense reflecting changes in residual value estimates  prospectively  on  a  straight-line  basis. For  finance  leases,  we  recognize  residual  value  adjustments  through  a  reduction  of  finance  revenue  over  the remaining lease term.\n\nWe evaluate the carrying value of equipment on operating leases for potential impairment when we determine a triggering event has occurred. When a triggering event occurs, we perform a test for recoverability by comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases. If  the  test  for  recoverability  identifies  a  possible  impairment,  we  measure  the  fair  value  of  the  equipment  on  operating  leases  in  accordance  with  the  fair  value measurement framework. We recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases exceeds its estimated fair value.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases was $1.55 billion. Without consideration of other factors such as third-party residual guarantees or contractual customer purchase options, a 10 percent non-temporary decrease in the market value of our equipment subject to operating leases would reduce residual value estimates and result in the recognition of approximately $70 million of additional annual depreciation expense.\n\nFair values for goodwill impairment tests We test goodwill for impairment annually, at the reporting unit level, and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell all or a portion of a reporting unit. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis.\n\nWe  review  goodwill  for  impairment  utilizing  either  a  qualitative  assessment  or  a  quantitative  goodwill  impairment  test. If  we  choose  to  perform  a  qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary. For reporting units where we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, we do not consider the goodwill impaired. If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, we recognize the difference as an impairment loss.\n\nFor reporting units where we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test, the process requires valuation of the respective reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on a discounted five year forecasted cash flow with a year-five residual value. We compute the residual value using the constant growth method, which values the forecasted cash flows in perpetuity. The assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on each reporting unit's long-term forecast and are subject to review and approval by senior management. A reporting unit's discount rate is a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital, which we believe approximates the rate from a market participant's perspective. The estimated fair value could be impacted by changes in market conditions, interest rates, growth rates, tax rates, costs, pricing and capital expenditures. We categorize the fair value determination as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs.\n\nWe completed our annual assessment of goodwill  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2024  and  determined  that  there  was  no  impairment  of  goodwill.  Caterpillar's  market capitalization has remained significantly above the net book value of the Company.\n\nAn unfavorable change in our expectations for the financial performance of our reporting units, particularly long-term growth and profitability, would reduce the fair value of our reporting units. The demand for our equipment and related parts is highly cyclical and significantly impacted by commodity prices, although the impact may  vary  by  reporting  unit. The  energy  and  mining  industries  are  major  users  of  our  products,  including  the  mineral  ex traction,  oil  and  natural  gas  industries. Decisions to purchase our products are dependent upon the performance of those industries, which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices. Lower commodity prices or industry specific circumstances that have a negative impact to the valuation assumptions may reduce the fair value of our reporting units. Should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value has fallen below its carrying value, we will perform an interim goodwill impairment  test(s),  in  addition  to  the  annual  impairment  test.    Future  impairment  tests  may  result  in  a  goodwill  impairment,  depending  on  the  outcome  of  the quantitative impairment test. We would report a goodwill impairment as a non-cash charge to earnings.",

Goodwill\n\nFor acquisitions accounted for as a business combination, goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired.  We are required to test goodwill for impairment, at the reporting unit level, annually and when events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred.  A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a component) to which goodwill is assigned  when  initially  recorded. We  assign  goodwill  to  reporting  units  based  on  our  integration  plans  and  the  ex pected  synergies  resulting  from  the acquisition.  Because Caterpillar is a highly integrated company, the businesses we acquire are sometimes combined with or integrated into existing reporting units.  When changes occur in the composition of our operating segments or reporting units, we reassign goodwill to the affected reporting units based on their relative fair values.\n\nWe perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of  October 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis.   We review goodwill for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative goodwill impairment test.

E stimates in financial statements\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The more significant estimates include: residual values for leased assets, fair values for goodwill impairment tests, warranty liability and reserves for product liability and insurance losses, postretirement benefits, post-sale discounts, credit losses and income taxes.\n\n## J.

Union Pacific explicitly states that its non-qualified (supplemental) pension plan is unfunded by design, meaning it does not set aside assets to cover these obligations. This suggests Lockheed Martin has more structured financial commitments tied to specific contracts, while Union Pacific maintains a more direct financial risk exposure due to the unfunded nature of its plan.",

For  additional information about obligations and our future minimum contribution requirements for these plans, see 'Note 12 - Postretirement Benefit  Plans'  included  in  our  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  Amounts  related  to  other  liabilities  represent  the contractual obligations for certain long-term liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2021. Such amounts mainly include expected payments under non-qualified pension plans, environmental liabilities and deferred compensation plans.\n\nPurchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages. Such agreements and contracts may, for example, be related to direct materials, obligations to subcontractors and outsourcing arrangements. Total purchase  obligations  for  operating  activities  in  the  preceding  table  include  approximately  $52.8  billion  related  to  contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our U.S. Government customers. The U.S. Government generally would be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related contracts 'for convenience' under the FAR, subject to available funding. This also would be true in cases where we perform subcontract work for a prime contractor under a U.S. Government contract. The termination for convenience language also may be included in contracts with foreign, state and local governments. We also have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions, including contracts with commercial customers.\n\nThe majority of our capital expenditures for 2021 and those planned for 2022 are for equipment, facilities infrastructure and information technology. The amounts above in the table represent the portion of expected capital expenditures to be incurred in 2022 and beyond that have been obligated under contracts as of December 31, 2021 and not necessarily total capital expenditures for  future  periods.  Expenditures  for  equipment  and  facilities  infrastructure  are  generally  incurred  to  support  new  and  existing programs  across  all  of  our  business  segments.  For  example,  we  have  projects  underway  at  Aeronautics  to  support  classified development programs and at RMS to support our Sikorsky helicopter programs; and we have projects underway to modernize certain of our facilities. We also incur capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software.\n\nWe  also  may  enter  into  industrial  cooperation  agreements,  sometimes  referred  to  as  offset  agreements,  as  a  condition  to obtaining  orders  for  our  products  and  services  from  certain  customers  in  foreign  countries.  These  agreements  are  designed  to enhance  the  social  and  economic  environment  of  the  foreign  country  by  requiring  the  contractor  to  promote  investment  in  the country. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in-country projects and the purchase by third parties (e.g. , our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements also may be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, establishment of joint ventures with local companies and building or leasing facilities for in-country operations. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement. Satisfaction of our offset obligations are included in the estimates of our total costs to complete the contract and may impact our sales, profitability and cash flows. Our ability to recover investments on our consolidated balance sheet that we make to satisfy offset obligations is generally dependent upon the successful operation of",

This expense is subject to achievement of the performance measures established for the performance stock unit grants.\n\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan - Our ESPP started in July 2021. Employee and Company contributions are used to issue treasury shares the month after employee contributions are withheld based on the settlement date closing price. The Company matches 40% contributed by the employee up to a maximum employee contribution of 5% of monthly salary (limited to $15,000 annually). We expense the Company contributions in the month the employee services were rendered (i.e., the month the employee contributions were withheld).\n\n## 5. Retirement Plans\n\n## Pension Benefits\n\nWe provide defined benefit retirement income to eligible non-union employees through qualified and non-qualified (supplemental) pension plans. Qualified and non-qualified pension benefits are based on years of service and the highest compensation during the latest years of employment, with specific reductions made for early retirements. Non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2018, are no longer eligible for pension benefits, but are eligible for an enhanced 401(k) benefit as described below in other retirement programs.\n\n## Funded Status\n\nWe are required by GAAP to separately recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our pension plans as an asset or liability. The funded status represents the difference between the projected benefit obligation (PBO) and the fair value of the plan assets. Our non-qualified (supplemental) pension plan is unfunded by design. The PBO of the pension plans is the present value of benefits earned to date by plan participants, including the effect of assumed future compensation increases. Plan assets are measured at fair value. We use a December 31 measurement date for plan assets and obligations for all our retirement plans.",

      "answer": "UNP's retiree benefits deferred tax asset decreased from $255 million in 2020 to $39 million in 2021, a reduction of $216 million. This indicates a significant decline in the tax benefit associated with retiree obligations. Meanwhile, LMT explicitly states that retiree benefits are excluded from business segment operating profit because they are not considered part of management's evaluation of segment performance. This reveals that while both companies report retiree benefits, they treat them differently in financial reporting: UNP reflects the changing value of its retiree benefits as a deferred tax asset, while LMT excludes them entirely from segment-level performance metrics.",

United Launch Alliance (ULA), results of which are included in our Space business segment, is our largest equity method investee.\n\nBusiness segment operating profit also excludes the FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment, a portion of corporate costs not considered allowable or allocable to contracts with the U.S. Government under the applicable U.S. Government cost accounting standards  (CAS)  or  federal  acquisition  regulations  (FAR),  and  other  items  not  considered  part  of  management's  evaluation  of segment  operating  performance  such  as  a  portion  of  management  and  administration  costs,  legal  fees  and  settlements, environmental costs, stock-based compensation expense, retiree benefits, significant severance actions, significant asset impairments, gains or losses from divestitures, and other miscellaneous corporate activities.\n\nExcluded items are included in the reconciling item 'Unallocated items' between operating profit from our business segments and our consolidated operating profit. See 'Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies' for a discussion related to certain factors that may impact the comparability of net sales and operating profit of our business segments.",

      "answer": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) allocates indirect costs such as overhead and general administrative expenses directly to specific contracts under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method. These allocations are critical for determining both sales and cost of sales on a contract-by-contract basis. In contrast, Union Pacific (UNP) capitalizes indirect costs as part of its property, plant, and equipment when those costs are incurred in making self-constructed assets ready for intended use. In 2021, UNP capitalized $2.9 billion in total capital investments, which included material, labor, and indirect costs, thereby spreading these costs over the useful life of the related assets rather than recognizing them as current expenses. This results in different financial reporting outcomes: LMT's approach directly ties indirect costs to revenue recognition on long-term contracts, while UNP's approach defers these costs to align with long-term asset valuation and depreciation.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From LMT's 10-K, identify that indirect costs are allocated at the contract level and are part of determining cost of sales under the percentage-of-completion method.",

Under  the percentage-of-completion  cost-to-cost  method,  we  record  net  sales  on  contracts  over  time  based  upon  our  progress  towards completion on a particular contract, as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion. The following discussion of material  changes  in  our  consolidated  net  sales  should  be  read  in  tandem  with  the  subsequent  discussion  of  changes  in  our consolidated cost of sales and our business segment results of operations because changes in our sales are typically accompanied by a corresponding change in our cost of sales due to the nature of the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method.\n\n## Product Sales\n\nProduct sales increased $1.5 billion, or 3%, in 2021 as compared to 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to higher product sales of approximately $735 million at RMS due to higher production volume on various Sikorsky helicopter programs and for training and logistics solutions (TLS) programs due to the delivery of an international pilot training system; $465 million at MFC  due  to  higher  volume  on  PAC-3,  Long  Range  Anti-Ship  Missile  (LRASM)  and  Joint  Air-to-Surface  Standoff  Missile (JASSM) programs; and $305 million at Aeronautics due to higher volume on classified contracts and F-16 production contracts, partially offset by lower volume on F-35 development contracts.\n\n## Service Sales\n\nService  sales  increased  $139  million,  or  1%,  in  2021  as  compared  to  2020.  The  increase  in  service  sales  was  primarily attributable to higher sales of approximately $180 million at Aeronautics due to higher sustainment volume on F-35, partially offset by lower sustainment volume on F-22.\n\n## Cost of Sales\n\nCost of sales, for both products and services, consist of materials, labor, subcontracting costs and an allocation of indirect costs (overhead and general and administrative), as well as the costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred  to  as  offset  agreements,  required  under  certain  contracts  with  international  customers.  For  each  of  our  contracts,  we monitor the nature and amount of costs at the contract level, which form the basis for estimating our total costs to complete the contract.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement,  whether  due  to  error  or  fraud.  Our  audits  included  performing  procedures  to  assess  the  risks  of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures  in  the  financial  statements.  Our  audits  also  included  evaluating  the  accounting  principles  used  and significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  presentation  of  the  financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe  critical  audit  matter  communicated  below  is  a  matter  arising  from  the  current-period  audit  of  the  financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to  the  financial  statements  and  (2)  involved  our  especially  challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Capitalization of Properties -Refer to Notes 2 and 11 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe  Corporation's  operations  are  highly  capital  intensive  and  their  large  network  of  assets  turns  over  on  a continuous basis. Each year, the Corporation develops a capital program for both the replacement of assets and for the acquisition or construction of new assets. In determining whether costs should be capitalized, the Corporation exercises significant judgment in determining whether expenditures meet the applicable minimum units of property criteria and extend the useful life, improve the safety of operations, or improve the operating efficiency of existing assets. The Corporation capitalizes all costs of capital projects necessary to make assets ready for their intended use and because a portion of the Corporation's assets are self-constructed, management also exercises significant judgment  in  determining  the  amount  of  material,  labor,  work  equipment,  and  indirect  costs  that  qualify  for capitalization. Properties, net were $54,871 million as of December 31, 2021 and, during 2021, the Corporation's capital investments were $2.9 billion.\n\nWe identified the capitalization of property as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgment exercised by management in determining whether costs meet the criteria for capitalization. This, in turn, required a high degree of auditor judgment when performing audit procedures to evaluate whether the criteria to capitalize costs were met and to evaluate sufficiency of audit evidence to support management's conclusions.",

      "question": "How does the shift in GE's Renewable Energy revenue mix, particularly from Onshore Wind and Grid Solutions, contrast with the negative mix effects in Union Pacific's Bulk and Industrial segments, and what are the respective financial impacts on each company's performance in 2023?",
      "answer": "GE's Renewable Energy segment saw a positive revenue mix effect, particularly from increased demand in Onshore Wind projects in the U.S. and a significant $2 gigawatt HVDC systems agreement in Grid Solutions, which contributed to a $5.7 billion (22%) increase in segment revenues. In contrast, Union Pacific experienced negative mix effects in both its Bulk and Industrial segments, with fewer food and refrigerated shipments and a shift toward short-haul rock shipments, contributing to a decline in freight revenues despite volume increases in some areas.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from GE_10k_2023.pdf - GE's Renewable Energy segment revenues increased by $5.7 billion (22%), driven by Onshore Wind and Grid Solutions, including a $2 gigawatt HVDC systems agreement.",
        "Step 2: Extract from UNP_10k_2023.pdf - Union Pacific's Bulk segment revenues decreased due to negative mix from fewer food and refrigerated shipments, and Industrial segment revenues were impacted by a shift toward short-haul rock shipments.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - GE benefits from a favorable revenue mix in renewable energy markets, particularly in the U.S. due to the Inflation Reduction Act, while UNP faces headwinds from unfavorable revenue mix in traditional freight segments, reflecting contrasting sector dynamics in the energy transition."

      "answer": "GD's post-retirement benefit obligations require significant future contributions, as seen by the $241 million required in 2025, which creates a defined short-term liquidity need. In contrast, GE's obligations are not only subject to required contributions but also to external economic factors such as interest rates and investment returns, which can increase liabilities unpredictably and create variable liquidity pressures. Together, these disclosures show that while GD faces a known and planned liquidity outflow, GE faces uncertain and potentially larger liquidity demands due to market exposure tied to its post-retirement benefit obligations.",

          "chunk_text": "face. The airline industry has historically been highly cyclical, and sustained economic growth and political stability in both developed and emerging markets are principal factors underlying long-term air traffic growth; the current macroeconomic and geopolitical environment and the potential for recession or armed conflict pose risks to the rate of that growth. A  potential future disruption in connection with a terrorist incident, war, cy berattack, actual or threatened public health pandemic or emergency or recessionary economic environment that results in the loss of business and leisure traffic could also adversely affect our customers, their ability  to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely  fashion or at all, demand for our products and serv ices and the v iability  of a customer's business. (See also Risk Factors - Commercial aviation sector.) In addition, our customers include governmental entities within and outside the U.S., including the U.S. federal government. Sustained and increased funding from government customers supports research, new product development, production and aftermarket business for our defense business, and a variety of domestic and international political, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, including recession, can materially affect our customers' ability to secure budget support and fund these activities year after year. We also at times face greater challenges collecting on receivables with customers that are sovereign governments or located in emerging markets. If there is significant deterioration in the global economy, in our sector, in financial markets or with particular significant counterparties, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\n\nRun-off insurance and banking operations - We continue to have exposure to our run-off insurance operations and Bank BPH mortgage portfolio in Poland . While in recent years we have greatly reduced the scope of GE's former financial services operations, we continue to retain significant exposure to legacy insurance and other financial services operations that will run off over a long period of time and, in the event of future adverse developments, could cause funding or liquidity  stress. For ex ample, it is possible that results of our statutory  testing of insurance reserv es in future y ears will require additional capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries, even after the capital contribution made in the first quarter of 2024 that completed the contributions in connection with the statutory permitted practice approved in 2018 by the Kansas Insurance Department (KID). Our statutory testing of insurance reserves is subject to a variety of assumptions, including assumptions about the discount rate (which is sensitive to changes in market interest rates), morbidity, mortality and future long-term care premium increases. Future adverse changes to these assumptions (to the extent not offset by any favorable changes to these assumptions) could result in an increase to future policy benefit reserves and, potentially, to the amount of capital we are required to contribute to our insurance subsidiaries (as discussed in the Other Items - Insurance section within the M D&amp;A ). In addition, we have exposure to various financial counterparties that pose credit and other risks in the event of insolvency or other default. For example, a portion of our run-off insurance operations' assets are held in trust accounts associated with reinsurance contracts. For our UFLIC subsidiary, such trust assets are currently held in trusts for the benefit of insurance company subsidiaries of Genworth, which has stated in the past that it will not bolster the capital position of its insurance subsidiaries. Solvency or other concerns about Genworth or its insurance company subsidiaries may cause those subsidiaries or their regulators to take or attempt to take actions that could adversely affect UFLIC, including control over assets in the relevant trusts. It is also possible that additional contingent liabilities and loss estimates for Bank BPH, in connection with the ongoing litigation in Poland related to its portfolio of residential mortgage loans denominated in or indexed to foreign currencies (see Note 24), will need to be recognized (or loss estimates may increase in the future) and will require additional capital contributions. Regulatory requirements and agreements with respect to our run-off insurance operations and Bank BPH require us to maintain adequate levels of capital and could require additional infusion of capital if the required levels are not maintained. Though we may consider strategic options to accelerate the further reduction in the size of these remaining financial services operations, such options may not be viable or attractive because of the associated cash payments, financial charges or other adverse effects. There can be no assurance that future liabilities, losses or impairments to the carrying value of assets within our financial services operations would not materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, cash flows or results of operations.\n\nBorrowings &amp; liquidity - We may face risks related to the refinancing of our debt, particularly in severely adverse market conditions, and future credit downgrades could adversely affect our liquidity, funding costs and related margins. We intend to maintain a sustainable investment-grade long-term credit rating, but there can be no assurance that we will not face future credit rating downgrades as a result of factors such as a change in business strategy or performance, or changes in rating application or methodology. Future downgrades could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity and competitive position, and external conditions in the financial and credit markets may limit our availability to refinance our debt at particular times or on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, if we are unable to generate cash flows in accordance with our plans or face unforeseen needs for capital, we may adopt changes to our capital allocation plans (such as plans related to the timing or amounts of investments or capital expenditures, share repurchases or dividends) or take other actions. Further, our pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations are exposed to economic factors, such as changes in interest rates, investment performance of plan assets, and health care costs, which could adversely impact our leverage and liquidity. For additional discussion about our credit ratings, financial conditions and related considerations, refer to the Capital Resources and Liquidity section within M D&amp;A . For discussion regarding how our financial statements have been and can be affected by our pension and healthcare benefit obligations, see Note 13.\n\nLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS. Legal and compliance risk relates to risks arising from the government and regulatory environment, legal proceedings and compliance with integrity policies and procedures, including matters relating to financial reporting and the environment, health and safety. Government and regulatory risk includes the risk that government or regulatory actions will impose additional cost on us or require us to make adverse changes to our business models or practices.\n\nRegulatory - We are subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations and government policies that require ongoing compliance efforts and may change in significant ways. Our business is subject to regulation under a wide variety of U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. laws, regulations and policies that require ongoing compliance efforts. There can be no assurance that laws, regulations and policies will not be changed or interpreted or enforced in ways that will require us to modify our business models and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs or prohibiting them",

The development and protection of intellectual property rights are a source of competitive advantage within our industry, and protection of key design, manufacturing, repair and product upgrade technologies is important to our business. We maintain, continue to grow, and curate a portfolio of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights stemming from our research and development activities. In some circumstances we license intellectual property to commercial customers, such as to support the maintenance and repair of our products to keep them in safe and airworthy condition. Government customers may also have licenses to some of our intellectual property that is developed or used in the performance of government contracts. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to our business, we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on the preservation of any singular intellectual property right or patent license. The 'GE' name and logo are licensed to various former businesses, including GE HealthCare and GE Vernova, pursuant to agreements governing their use.\n\nSUPPLY CHAIN. We rely on a global supply chain for a wide range of raw materials, commodities, components, parts, M RO services and other indirect spend. Our supply chain is complex and extends into many different countries and regions around the world. We depend on the ability of our suppliers and partners to meet quality standards, performance specifications and delivery schedules at our anticipated costs. In some cases, we also must comply with specific procurement requirements that limit the suppliers and subcontractors we may utilize. Some of our suppliers or their sub-suppliers are limited- or sole-source suppliers, and our ability  to meet our obligations to customers depends on the product quality, performance, continued product availability and stability of such suppliers. We employ a number of strategies focused on continuity of supply of raw materials, including monitoring geopolitical and geographical changes and developing counteractions in response to identified risks, evaluating alternate materials and sources and working with suppliers to secure both short- and long-term capacity. Partnering with suppliers, leveraging FLIGHT DECK, we are working to improve material input, supporting our deliveries across internal shop visits, spare part sales and equipment. We operate in a supply-constrained environment that has impacted our industry for the past several years. See the M D&amp;A section for additional discussion of these dynamics.\n\nCOMPETITION. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive in terms of pricing, product and service quality, durability and reliability, product development and introduction time, intellectual property, customer service, financing terms, the ability to respond to shifts in market demand and the ability to attract and retain skilled talent. We compete with other global engine manufacturers in sales of commercial and defense engines and services. Key competitors in commercial engine services also include third-party M RO shops. In DPT, we compete against a range of U.S. and non-U.S. companies or groups for contract and subcontract awards by governments and their prime contractors. Customer selections for aircraft engines, components and systems can also have a significant impact on future sales of parts and services over the life of an engine platform. Competitors may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives, performance and operating cost guarantees and participation in financing arrangements in an effort to secure an installed base that establishes aftermarket sales associated with these products.\n\nREGULATORY MATTERS. As an aerospace and defense company, we are subject to a wide range of U.S. federal, state and non-U.S. laws and regulations related to our products, services and business operations, including the significant areas of law and regulation summarized below that can apply to our business directly and indirectly. Like other industrial manufacturing companies that operate globally in high-tech sectors, we face significant scrutiny from both U.S. and foreign governmental authorities with respect to regulatory compliance. We regularly engage with our regulators and work to comply with existing, new and changing requirements across relevant jurisdictions, as compliance (or failure to properly comply) with any of these requirements can pose costs and impact our operations. For additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Risk Factors and Note 24.",

      "question": "How does the difference in contract mix between General Dynamics' defense segments and Lockheed Martin's contract structure influence their respective operating earnings and margin volatility?",
      "answer": "General Dynamics notes that operating earnings and margin volatility in its defense segments are driven by changes in volume, performance, and contract mix, particularly emphasizing that contract mix refers to the proportion of higher- versus lower-margin work, which can vary based on contract type (e.g., fixed-price vs. cost-reimbursable) and type of work (e.g., development vs. production). Lockheed Martin, on the other hand, explicitly states that it operates under both fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts, with the latter including cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-fixed-fee structures. These cost-reimbursable contracts introduce variability in fees based on performance assessments or cost targets, directly affecting earnings and margins. Therefore, while both companies experience margin volatility due to contract mix, Lockheed Martin's detailed exposure to performance-based fees in its cost-reimbursable contracts introduces an additional layer of earnings sensitivity compared to General Dynamics' broader categorization of contract type and work stage impacts.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, General Dynamics states that contract mix affects profitability based on the proportion of high- versus low-margin contracts, including distinctions between fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts and the nature of work (development vs. production).",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, Lockheed Martin provides a detailed breakdown of its cost-reimbursable contracts, including performance-based and incentive-based fee structures, which directly influence earnings based on actual performance against targets.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies experience margin volatility due to contract mix, but Lockheed Martin's explicit exposure to performance-linked fees introduces a more dynamic and variable impact on earnings compared to General Dynamics' more generalized description of contract type effects."

          "chunk_text": "outfitted aircraft. Revenue associated with the segment's custom completions of narrow-body and wide-body aircraft and the segment's services businesses is recognized as work progresses or upon delivery of services. Fluctuations  in  revenue  from  period  to  period  result  from  the  number  and  mix  of  new  aircraft  deliveries, progress on aircraft completions, and the level and type of aircraft services performed during the period.\n\nThe majority of the Aerospace segment's operating costs relates to new aircraft production on firm orders and consists of labor, material, subcontractor and overhead costs. The costs are accumulated in production lots, recorded in inventory and recognized as operating costs at aircraft delivery based on the estimated average unit cost in a production lot. While changes in the estimated average unit cost for a production lot impact the level of operating costs, the amount of operating costs reported in a given period is based largely on the number and type of aircraft delivered. Operating costs in the Aerospace segment's completions and services businesses are recognized generally as incurred.\n\nFor new aircraft, operating earnings and margin are a function of the prices of our aircraft, our operational efficiency in manufacturing and outfitting the aircraft, and the mix of ultra-large-cabin, large-cabin and midcabin aircraft deliveries. Aircraft mix can also refer to the stage of program maturity for our aircraft models. A new aircraft model typically has lower margins in its initial production lots, and then margins generally increase as  we  realize  efficiencies  in  the  production  process. Additional  factors  affecting  the  segment's  earnings  and margin include the volume, mix and profitability of completions and services work performed, the market for pre-owned  aircraft,  and  the  level  of  general  and  administrative  (G&amp;A)  and  net  research  and  development (R&amp;D) costs incurred by the segment.\n\nIn the defense segments, revenue on long-term government contracts is recognized generally over time as the  work  progresses,  either  as  products  are  produced  or  as  services  are  rendered.  Typically,  revenue  is recognized  over  time  using  costs  incurred  to  date  relative  to  total  estimated  costs  at  completion  to  measure progress  toward  satisfying  our  performance  obligations.  Incurred  cost  represents  work  performed,  which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs include labor, material, overhead and, when appropriate, G&amp;A expenses. Variances in costs recognized from period to period reflect primarily increases and decreases in production or activity levels on individual contracts. Because costs are used as a measure of progress, year-over-year variances in cost result in corresponding variances in revenue, which we generally refer to as volume.\n\nOperating earnings and margin in the defense segments are driven by changes in volume, performance or contract mix. Performance refers to changes in profitability based on adjustments to estimates at completion on individual contracts. These adjustments result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract, the  estimated  costs  to  complete  the  contract  or  both.  Therefore,  changes  in  costs  incurred  in  the  period compared with  prior  periods  do  not  necessarily  impact  profitability.  It  is  only  when  total  estimated  costs  at completion on a given contract change without a corresponding change in the contract value (or vice versa) that the  profitability  of  that  contract  may  be  impacted.  Contract  mix  refers  to  changes  in  the  volume  of  higherversus lower-margin work. Higher or lower margins can result from a number of factors, including contract type (e.g.,  fixed-price/cost-reimbursable)  and  type  of  work  (e.g.,  development/production).  Contract  mix  can  also refer  to  the  stage  of  program  maturity  for  our  long-term  production  contracts.  New  long-term  production contracts  typically  have  lower  margins  initially,  and  then  margins  generally  increase  as  we  achieve  learning curve improvements or realize other cost reductions.",

(a)\n\nAt  December  31,  2021,  third-party  guarantees  totaled  $838  million,  of  which  approximately  69%  related  to  guarantees  of contractual  performance  of  joint  ventures  to  which  we  currently  are  or  previously  were  a  party.  These  amounts  represent  our estimate  of  the  maximum  amounts  we  would  expect  to  incur  upon  the  contractual  non-performance  of  the  joint  venture,  joint venture partners or divested businesses. Generally, we also have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a joint venture partner.\n\nIn determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, performance on contractual obligations, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current and former joint venture partners and the transferee under novation agreements all of which include a guarantee as required by the FAR. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no material amounts recorded in our financial statements related to third-party guarantees or novation agreements.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies\n\n## Contract Accounting / Sales Recognition\n\nThe majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. Government and international customers (including  FMS  contracted  through  the  U.S.  Government)  for  the  research,  design,  development,  manufacture,  integration  and sustainment  of  advanced  technology  systems,  products  and  services.  We  account  for  a  contract  when  it  has  approval  and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance  and  collectability  of  consideration  is  probable.  For  certain  contracts  that  meet  the  foregoing  requirements,  primarily international direct commercial sale contracts, we are required to obtain certain regulatory approvals. In these cases, we recognize revenue when it is probable that we will receive regulatory approvals based upon all known facts and circumstances. We provide our products and services under fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts.\n\nUnder fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fixedprice  contracts  have  a  performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance.\n\nCost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. Typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: costplus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-fixed-fee. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within  specified  limits  based  on  the  customer's  assessment  of  our  performance  against  a  predetermined  set  of  criteria,  such  as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e., incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e.,",

Similarly, LMT's financing activities used $5,328 million of cash, with the $600 million commercial paper repayment contributing to this outflow.

      "question": "How does the difference in revenue recognition methods between General Dynamics' defense segments and Lockheed Martin's cost-reimbursable contracts affect their respective financial reporting of operating earnings and contract profitability?",
      "answer": "General Dynamics recognizes revenue on long-term government contracts using costs incurred relative to total estimated costs at completion, which directly ties revenue fluctuations to changes in cost estimates and production volume. This method means that changes in estimated costs without corresponding changes in contract value impact profitability. Lockheed Martin, under cost-reimbursable contracts, is reimbursed for allowable costs plus a fee, with profitability capped by a ceiling amount and influenced by performance assessments or cost incentives. Therefore, while General Dynamics' profitability is sensitive to cost estimation accuracy and contract maturity, Lockheed Martin's earnings depend on cost control and performance-based incentives within a fixed funding limit.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - General Dynamics recognizes revenue based on costs incurred relative to total estimated costs at completion, and profitability changes occur only when estimated costs at completion change without a corresponding change in contract value.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Lockheed Martin operates under cost-reimbursable contracts where they are reimbursed for allowable costs plus a fee (e.g., cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee), with profitability capped by a ceiling amount and influenced by performance assessments or cost incentives.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The difference in contract types and revenue recognition methods leads to distinct financial reporting impacts: General Dynamics' earnings are tied to cost estimation accuracy and contract maturity, while Lockheed Martin\u2019s profitability is influenced by performance evaluations and cost control within a defined funding limit."

          "chunk_text": "outfitted aircraft. Revenue associated with the segment's custom completions of narrow-body and wide-body aircraft and the segment's services businesses is recognized as work progresses or upon delivery of services. Fluctuations  in  revenue  from  period  to  period  result  from  the  number  and  mix  of  new  aircraft  deliveries, progress on aircraft completions, and the level and type of aircraft services performed during the period.\n\nThe majority of the Aerospace segment's operating costs relates to new aircraft production on firm orders and consists of labor, material, subcontractor and overhead costs. The costs are accumulated in production lots, recorded in inventory and recognized as operating costs at aircraft delivery based on the estimated average unit cost in a production lot. While changes in the estimated average unit cost for a production lot impact the level of operating costs, the amount of operating costs reported in a given period is based largely on the number and type of aircraft delivered. Operating costs in the Aerospace segment's completions and services businesses are recognized generally as incurred.\n\nFor new aircraft, operating earnings and margin are a function of the prices of our aircraft, our operational efficiency in manufacturing and outfitting the aircraft, and the mix of ultra-large-cabin, large-cabin and midcabin aircraft deliveries. Aircraft mix can also refer to the stage of program maturity for our aircraft models. A new aircraft model typically has lower margins in its initial production lots, and then margins generally increase as  we  realize  efficiencies  in  the  production  process. Additional  factors  affecting  the  segment's  earnings  and margin include the volume, mix and profitability of completions and services work performed, the market for pre-owned  aircraft,  and  the  level  of  general  and  administrative  (G&amp;A)  and  net  research  and  development (R&amp;D) costs incurred by the segment.\n\nIn the defense segments, revenue on long-term government contracts is recognized generally over time as the  work  progresses,  either  as  products  are  produced  or  as  services  are  rendered.  Typically,  revenue  is recognized  over  time  using  costs  incurred  to  date  relative  to  total  estimated  costs  at  completion  to  measure progress  toward  satisfying  our  performance  obligations.  Incurred  cost  represents  work  performed,  which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs include labor, material, overhead and, when appropriate, G&amp;A expenses. Variances in costs recognized from period to period reflect primarily increases and decreases in production or activity levels on individual contracts. Because costs are used as a measure of progress, year-over-year variances in cost result in corresponding variances in revenue, which we generally refer to as volume.\n\nOperating earnings and margin in the defense segments are driven by changes in volume, performance or contract mix. Performance refers to changes in profitability based on adjustments to estimates at completion on individual contracts. These adjustments result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract, the  estimated  costs  to  complete  the  contract  or  both.  Therefore,  changes  in  costs  incurred  in  the  period compared with  prior  periods  do  not  necessarily  impact  profitability.  It  is  only  when  total  estimated  costs  at completion on a given contract change without a corresponding change in the contract value (or vice versa) that the  profitability  of  that  contract  may  be  impacted.  Contract  mix  refers  to  changes  in  the  volume  of  higherversus lower-margin work. Higher or lower margins can result from a number of factors, including contract type (e.g.,  fixed-price/cost-reimbursable)  and  type  of  work  (e.g.,  development/production).  Contract  mix  can  also refer  to  the  stage  of  program  maturity  for  our  long-term  production  contracts.  New  long-term  production contracts  typically  have  lower  margins  initially,  and  then  margins  generally  increase  as  we  achieve  learning curve improvements or realize other cost reductions.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Lockheed Martin Corporation\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies\n\nOrganization - We are a global security and aerospace company principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistics, system integration and cybersecurity services. We serve both U.S. and international  customers  with  products  and  services  that  have  defense,  civil  and  commercial  applications,  with  our  principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government. As described in 'Note 4 - Information on Business Segments', we operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, MFC, RMS and Space.\n\nOn June 30, 2021, the UK Ministry of Defence terminated the contract to operate the UK's nuclear deterrent program and assumed control of the entity that manages the program (referred to as the renationalization of the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE program)). Accordingly,  the AWE  program's  ongoing  operations,  including  the  entity  that  manages  the  program,  are  no longer included in our financial results as of that date, however, during 2021, AWE generated sales of $885 million and operating profit of $18 million, which are included in Space's financial results for the year ended December 31, 2021. During the year ended December  31,  2020, AWE  generated  sales  of  $1.4  billion  and  operating  profit  of  $35  million,  which  are  included  in  Space's financial results for 2020.\n\nBasis of presentation - These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of subsidiaries we control and variable interest  entities  if  we  are  the  primary  beneficiary.  We  eliminate  intercompany  balances  and  transactions  in  consolidation.  We classify certain assets and liabilities as current utilizing the duration of the related contract or program as our operating cycle, which is  generally  longer  than  one  year.  This  primarily  impacts  receivables,  contract  assets,  inventories,  and  contract  liabilities.  We classify all other assets and liabilities based on whether the asset will be realized or the liability will be paid within one year.\n\nUse of estimates - We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles  (GAAP).  In  doing  so,  we  are  required  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  amounts  reported  in  the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ materially from these estimates. Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, accounting for sales and cost recognition; postretirement benefit plans; environmental liabilities and assets for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery; evaluation of goodwill, intangible assets, investments and other assets for impairment; income taxes including deferred income taxes; fair value measurements; and contingencies.\n\nRevenue Recognition -The majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. Government and international customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) for the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We account for a contract  when  it  has  approval  and  commitment  from  both  parties,  the  rights  of  the  parties  are  identified,  payment  terms  are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. For certain contracts that meet the foregoing  requirements,  primarily  international  direct  commercial  sale  contracts,  we  are  required  to  obtain  certain  regulatory approvals. In these cases, we recognize revenue when it is probable that we will receive regulatory approvals based upon all known facts and circumstances. We provide our products and services under fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts.\n\nUnder fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fixedprice  contracts  have  a  performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance.\n\nCost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. Typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: costplus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-fixed-fee. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within  specified  limits  based  on  the  customer's  assessment  of  our  performance  against  a  predetermined  set  of  criteria,  such  as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e., incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e.,",

      "answer": "Caterpillar reported customer advances of $1,929 million in 2023, indicating it had received significant payments in advance from customers for equipment or services not yet fully delivered. In contrast, Emerson Electric showed customer advances of $(897) million in 2023, representing a liability position where the company had collected customer payments in advance but had not yet fulfilled the associated obligations. These contrasting figures reflect different working capital management approaches or contractual terms with their customers, with Caterpillar maintaining a larger advance payment position while Emerson operated with a net customer prepayment liability.",

        "Step 1: Extract Caterpillar's 2023 customer advances figure of $1,929 million from its 10-K filing, showing payments received in advance from customers.",
        "Step 2: Extract Emerson Electric's 2023 customer advances figure of $(897) million from its 10-K filing, indicating a liability position from advance customer payments.",
        "Step 3: Compare the two figures to understand different working capital dynamics in their customer payment arrangements, despite both reporting on the same financial metric."

The difference between the two is $51 million. This comparison highlights that CAT's Non-U.S. pension obligation, as of 2023, is significantly higher than EMR's projected Non-U.S. pension payment for 2025, indicating CAT holds a larger liability in its Non-U.S. pension plans relative to EMR's projected outflow for that specific year.",

In contrast, FedEx's 2024 report does not provide specific dollar amounts but notes that lower volumes contributed to reductions in purchased transportation costs, indicating a more qualitative, volume-driven narrative. This contrast suggests that UPS emphasizes granular cost visibility and segmentation, while FedEx focuses on strategic cost optimization through volume adjustments and operational efficiencies.",

Includes a $35 million charge in 2023 related to a separate FedEx Ground legal matter.\n\nOperating income increased in 2024 primarily due to our DRIVE program initiatives and base yield improvements at FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight, which more than offset volume declines at FedEx Freight and FedEx Express. Our DRIVE initiatives included continued benefits from network rationalization at FedEx Express, including structural flight takedowns and route optimization, and improvements in hub sort efficiency, as well as increasing linehaul efficiencies and improving dock productivity at FedEx Ground. Lower volumes contributed to reductions in salaries and employee benefits, fuel expense, purchased transportation, and rentals and landing fees. The effect of volume declines on salaries and employee benefits was offset by higher wages and variable incentive compensation. Other operating expenses decreased primarily due to lower bad debt accruals, professional fees, and self-insurance accruals.\n\nWe recognized $157 million and $70 million of asset impairment charges in 2024 and 2023, respectively, associated with the decision to permanently retire certain aircraft and related engines at FedEx Express. Our 2023 results also include $47 million of goodwill and other asset impairment charges associated with the ShopRunner acquisition at FedEx Dataworks. See the 'Goodwill and Other Asset Impairment Charges' section of this MD&amp;A for more information.\n\n## Fuel\n\nWe apply a fuel surcharge on our air and ground services, most of which are adjusted on a weekly basis. The fuel surcharge is based on a weekly fuel price from ten days prior to the week in which it is assessed. Some FedEx Express international fuel surcharges are updated on a monthly basis. We routinely review our fuel surcharges and periodically update the tables used to determine our fuel surcharges at all of our transportation segments.\n\nWhile fluctuations in fuel surcharge percentages can be significant from period to period, fuel surcharges represent one of the many individual components of our pricing structure that impact our overall revenue and yield. Additional components include the mix of services sold, the base price, and extra service charges we obtain for these services and level of pricing discounts offered.",

This ties directly to FedEx's acknowledgment of the importance of managing cost structure in response to shifting volume levels, as both companies identify average daily volume as a key indicator for understanding operating results.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION\n\n## ORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION\n\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition ('MD&amp;A') of FedEx Corporation ('FedEx') is composed of three major sections: Results of Operations and Outlook, Financial Condition, and Critical Accounting Estimates. These sections include the following information:\n\n- \u00b7Results of operations includes an overview of our consolidated 2024 results compared to 2023 results. This section also includes a discussion of key actions and events that impacted our results. Discussion and analysis of 2022 results and year-over-year comparisons between 2023 results and 2022 results can be found in 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition' of our Annual Report on Form 10-K ('Annual Report') for the year ended May 31, 2023.\n- \u00b7The overview is followed by a discussion of both historical operating results for our business segments in place during 2024 and 2023 and our outlook for 2025, as well as a financial summary and analysis for each of our transportation segments in place during 2024 and 2023.\n- \u00b7Our financial condition is reviewed through an analysis of key elements of our liquidity and capital resources, financial commitments, and liquidity outlook for 2025.\n- \u00b7Critical accounting estimates discusses those financial statement elements that we believe are most important to understanding the material judgments and assumptions incorporated in our financial results.\n\nThe discussion in MD&amp;A should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report, particularly 'Item 1. Business,' 'Item 1A. Risk Factors,' and 'Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\n## DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\nWe provide a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce, and business services, offering integrated business solutions utilizing our flexible, efficient, and intelligent global network. During 2024 and 2023, our primary operating companies were Federal Express Corporation ('FedEx Express'), the world's largest express transportation company; FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. ('FedEx Ground'), a leading North American provider of small-package ground delivery services; and FedEx Freight Corporation and its less-than-truckload ('LTL') operating subsidiary FedEx Freight, Inc. ('FedEx Freight'), a leading North American provider of LTL freight transportation services. For these periods, those companies represented our major service lines and, along with FedEx Corporate Services, Inc. ('FedEx Services'), constituted our reportable segments. Our FedEx Services segment provided sales, marketing, information technology, communications, customer service, technical support, billing and collection services, and certain back-office functions that supported our operating segments. The operating costs of the FedEx Services segment were allocated to the business units it served during 2024 and 2023.\n\nThis MD&amp;A is based on our segment reporting that was in effect during 2024 and 2023. In connection with our one FedEx consolidation, on June 1, 2024, FedEx Ground and FedEx Services were merged into Federal Express Corporation ('Federal Express'), becoming a single company operating a unified, fully integrated airground express network under the respected FedEx brand. FedEx Freight continues to provide LTL freight transportation services as a separate subsidiary. Beginning in the first quarter of 2025, Federal Ex press and FedEx  Freight represent our major service lines and constitute our reportable segments. Additionally, the results of FedEx Custom Critical, Inc. ('FedEx Custom Critical') will be included in the FedEx Freight segment instead of the Federal Express segment in 2025. Prior-year amounts will be revised to reflect this presentation. See 'Reportable Segments' below and 'Item 1. Business' for additional information.\n\nThe key indicators necessary to understand our operating results include:\n\n\u2022the overall customer demand for our various services based on macroeconomic factors and the global economy;\n\n- \u2022the volumes of transportation services provided through our networks, primarily measured by our average daily volume and shipment weight and size;\n- \u2022the mix of services purchased by our customers;\n- \u00b7the prices we obtain for our services, primarily measured by yield (revenue per package or pound or revenue per shipment or hundredweight for LTL freight shipments);\n\n\u2022our ability to manage our cost structure (capital ex penditures and operating ex penses) to match shifting volume levels; and",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Operating Expenses\n\nOperating expenses and non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses increased year over year. Pickup and delivery costs increased $1.1 billion and package sortation costs increased $291 million, slightly offset by a $173 million decrease in the costs of operating our integrated air and ground network, a decrease in other operating costs of $53 million and the impact from one less operating day in 2024 compared to 2023.\n\nThe cost increases were primarily due to an increase of $1.4 billion in compensation and benefits expense which was driven by the impact of wage and benefit rate increases for our union workforce under our contract with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (\"IBT\"), which became effective August 1, 2023. Thirdparty delivery costs for our SurePost product increased $213 million due to higher SurePost volume.\n\nThe cost decreases were primarily due to a reduction in fuel expense, driven by decreases in the cost of jet and ground fuel, a decrease in worker's compensation expense and the impact of reductions in our workforce under our Fit to Serve initiative.\n\nAs of the fourth quarter of 2024, U.S. air cargo operating ex pense is presented within our U.S. Domestic Package segment and prior periods have been recast.\n\nOur non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses in this segment exclude the impact of total transformation strategy costs of $147 million, a pre-tax charge to withdraw from a multiemployer pension plan of $19 million and asset impairment charges of $5 million. Total transformation strategy costs within the segment during 2024 were related to our Fit to Serve, Transformation 2.0 and Efficiency Reimagined programs. Within these programs, we incurred compensation and benefits costs related to workforce reductions as we right-size our business. Additionally, within Transformation 2.0 and Efficiency Reimagined , we incurred costs related to outside professional service providers. For additional information on these enterprise programs, our expected benefits and the related costs, see 'Supplemental Information - Items Affecting Comparability'.\n\nCost per piece increased 0.6% for the year and non-GAAP adjusted cost per piece increased 0.8%, as expense increases, driven by an increase in compensation and benefits expense, outpaced growth in average daily volume. Cost per piece is expected to increase during 2025 as we expect to incur costs to further our strategic initiatives and we ex pect average daily volume to decrease as discussed above.\n\n## Operating Profit and Margin\n\nAs a result of the factors described above, operating profit decreased $811 million, with operating margin decreasing 140 basis points to 7.2%. Non-GAAP adjusted operating profit decreased $967 million, with non-GAAP adjusted operating margin decreasing 160 basis points to 7.5%.",

      "answer": "Boeing's 777X program, which operates with near break-even or single-digit margins as of December 31, 2023, faces significant risks to program profitability due to estimation uncertainties and potential cost overruns. A material adverse change in the profitability of this or other Boeing programs could result in earnings charges that ripple through its supplier network. Pratt & Whitney, a division of RTX, is already under financial strain due to production challenges and an accelerated inspection requirement for its Geared Turbofan (GTF) engines, particularly the PW1100G-JM model used in the A320neo family. These issues have led to increased engine removals, inspections, shop visits, and aircraft on ground levels, all of which increase RTX's costs. If Boeing's 777X program experiences further delays or cost increases, it could place additional pressure on suppliers like RTX to absorb cost overruns or meet delivery schedules, potentially exacerbating RTX's existing financial and operational challenges with the GTF engine family.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Boeing's 777X program had near break-even or single-digit margins at the end of 2023, and adverse changes in revenue or cost estimates could result in future earnings charges.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Pratt & Whitney's Geared Turbofan engines, especially the PW1100G-JM, are facing production and inspection challenges that have increased costs and operational disruptions.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Boeing's program profitability risks could lead to cost pressures on suppliers like RTX, which is already facing increased costs and delays with its GTF engine family, potentially worsening its financial obligations."

      "answer": "Boeing (BA) directly ties firm orders to its program accounting quantity, which influences revenue estimates, cost projections, and ultimately gross profit margins. A 1% change in gross margin percentages across BA's commercial airplane programs would impact operating earnings by approximately $330 million. RTX, on the other hand, reports that firm orders are a key component of backlog, which stood at $196 billion as of December 31, 2023. This backlog directly reflects forward-looking sales growth and is reduced as sales are recognized. Therefore, a decline in firm orders would reduce RTX\u2019s backlog and future revenue visibility, while for BA, it would affect the accounting quantity and could lead to margin adjustments or even earnings charges, especially for programs like the 777X and 787 that are already near break-even. Both companies are thus exposed to financial risk from fluctuations in firm orders, though the mechanism differs\u2014BA through program-level accounting and margin volatility, and RTX through backlog-driven revenue forecasting.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Boeing ties 'firm orders' to the determination of program accounting quantity, and a 1% change in gross margin percentages would impact operating earnings by $330 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - RTX defines backlog as the aggregate value of firm orders not yet delivered, which was $196 billion as of December 31, 2023, and is a key performance metric for forward-looking sales.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies rely on firm orders to project financial performance: Boeing uses them to estimate accounting quantities and gross margins, while RTX uses them to measure backlog and future revenue. A drop in firm orders would therefore affect both companies' financial outlooks, albeit through different mechanisms: margin volatility for Boeing and revenue predictability for RTX."

      "answer": "Boeing's financial exposure is highly sensitive to changes in gross margins, where a 1% change in margin could result in a $330 million impact on operating earnings due to its reliance on firm orders and complex estimation process for program profitability. Raytheon, with a $78 billion defense backlog as of December 31, 2023, also depends on firm orders to drive future revenue and operational planning. A decline in firm orders would reduce Raytheon\u2019s future revenue visibility and could impact its ability to manage long-term contracts efficiently, while Boeing would face direct earnings volatility due to its margin sensitivity and program cost structures. Together, both companies face significant financial risk if firm orders decrease, though the mechanisms differ\u2014Boeing through margin volatility and Raytheon through reduced backlog conversion.",

      "answer": "MMM excludes 'special items' broadly from its adjusted measures, without specifying exact categories beyond that general term, indicating a more generalized approach to removing non-recurring or non-operational impacts. In contrast, UPS specifically excludes five distinct categories: goodwill and asset impairment charges, a one-time compensation payment to supervisors, a regulatory matter expense, multiemployer pension plan withdrawal expense, and defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plan gains and losses. This reveals that UPS takes a more detailed and itemized approach to its adjusted measures, isolating specific events and expenses to better reflect ongoing operational performance, whereas MMM's approach appears more general and less prescriptive in its exclusions.",

        "Step 1: From MMM's disclosure, we learn that the company excludes 'special items' from its adjusted measures, but the term is not further defined or itemized in the excerpt.",

For more information regarding goodwill and current year asset impairment charges, see note 7 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\n\n## One-Time Compensation Payment\n\nWe exclude the impact of a one-time payment made to certain U.S.-based, non-union part-time supervisors following the ratification of our labor agreement with the Teamsters in 2023. We do not expect this or similar payments to recur.\n\n## Expense for Regulatory Matter\n\nWe exclude the impact of a charge to settle a regulatory matter that we consider to be unrelated to our ongoing operations and that we do not expect to recur. For more information regarding this regulatory matter, see note 10 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Multiemployer Pension Plan Withdrawal Expense\n\nWe exclude the impact of a charge related to the withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan within the United States. We do not consider this expense to be related to our ongoing operations. For more information regarding our multiemployer pension plans, see note 6 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Defined Benefit Pension and Postretirement Medical Plan Gains and Losses\n\nWe incur certain employment-related expenses associated with pension and postretirement medical benefits. These pension and postretirement medical benefits costs for company-sponsored defined benefit plans are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies, including discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, healthcare cost trend rates, inflation, compensation increase rates, mortality rates and coordination of benefits with plans not sponsored by UPS. Actuarial assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis, unless circumstances require an interim remeasurement of any of our plans.\n\nWe recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10% corridor (defined as 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plan's projected benefit obligation), as well as gains and losses resulting from plan curtailments and settlements, for our defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plans immediately as part of Investment income (expense) and other in the statements of consolidated income. We supplement the presentation of our income before income taxes, net income and earnings per share with adjusted measures that exclude the impact of these gains and losses and the related income tax effects.

      "answer": "Both General Dynamics (GD) and Raytheon Technologies (RTX) include lease pre-payments in the calculation of right-of-use (ROU) assets, but the specific language and emphasis on how these pre-payments are incorporated differ. GD explicitly states that lease pre-payments are part of the ROU asset calculation along with deferred rent and initial direct costs. RTX confirms that lease pre-payments made at or before the commencement date are included in the ROU asset, which is also adjusted for lease incentives received. The treatment is largely consistent under ASC 842, but the emphasis on initial direct costs and incentives is more detailed in RTX\u2019s disclosure.",

When it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option, we include the impact of the option in the lease term for purposes of determining total future lease payments. As most of our lease agreements do not explicitly state the discount rate implicit in the lease, we use our incremental borrowing rate on the commencement date to calculate the present value of future payments.\n\nOur leases commonly include payments that are based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or other similar indices. These variable lease payments are included in the calculation of the ROU asset and lease liability. Other variable lease payments, such as usage-based amounts, are excluded from the ROU asset and lease liability, and are expensed as incurred. In addition to the present value of the future lease payments, the calculation of the ROU asset also includes any deferred rent, lease pre-payments and initial direct costs of obtaining the lease, such as commissions.\n\nIn addition to the base rent, real estate leases typically contain provisions for common-area maintenance and other similar services, which are considered non-lease components for accounting purposes. For our real estate leases, we apply a practical expedient to include these non-lease components in calculating the ROU asset and lease liability. For all other types of leases, non-lease components are excluded from our ROU assets and lease liabilities and expensed as incurred.\n\nOur  leases  are  for  office  space,  manufacturing  facilities,  and  machinery  and  equipment.  Real  estate represents over 75% of our lease obligations.\n\nThe components of lease costs were as follows:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "\nLeases. As a lessee, we record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for leases with terms longer  than  12  months.  Leases  are  classified  as  either  finance  or  operating,  with  classification  affecting  the  pattern  of  expense recognition in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n\nWe enter  into  lease  agreements  for  the  use  of  real  estate  space,  vehicles,  information  technology  equipment,  and  certain  other equipment under both operating and finance leases. We determine if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in Operating lease right-of-use assets and Operating lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The current portion of our operating lease liabilities is included in Accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Finance leases are not considered significant to our Consolidated Balance Sheet or Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n\nRight-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the  present  value  of  lease  payments  over  the  lease  term.  As  most  of  our  leases  do  not  provide  an  implicit  rate,  we  use  our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments,  and  use  the  implicit  rate  when  readily  determinable.  We  determine  our  incremental  borrowing  rate  through  market sources including relevant industry rates. Our lease right-of-use assets also include any initial direct costs and lease pre-payments made at or before the commencement date and are reduced for any lease incentives received at or before the commencement date. Certain of our leases include variable payments, which may vary based upon changes in facts or circumstances after the start of the lease.  We  exclude  variable  payments  from  lease  right-of-use  assets  and  lease  liabilities,  to  the  extent  such  payments  are  not considered fixed, and instead, expense variable payments as incurred. Variable lease expense and lease expense for short duration contracts are not a material component of lease expense. Some of our leases include the option to extend or terminate the lease. We include these options in the recognition of our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option. Lease expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nIn  limited  instances  we  act  as  a  lessor,  primarily  for  commercial  aerospace  engines,  the  majority  of  which  are  classified  as operating leases. These leases are not significant to our Consolidated Balance Sheet or Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n\nOther  Long-Lived  Assets. We  evaluate  the  potential  impairment  of  other  long-lived  assets  whenever  events  or  changes  in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of other long-lived assets held and used exceeds the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows, the carrying value is written down to fair value. In order for long-lived assets to be considered held for disposal, we must have committed to a plan to dispose of the assets. Once deemed held for disposal, the assets are stated at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value.\n\nIncome Taxes. Future  income taxes represent the tax effects of transactions which are reported in different periods for tax and financial  reporting  purposes.  These  amounts  consist  of  the  tax  effects  of  temporary  differences  between  the  tax  and  financial reporting balance sheets and tax carryforwards. Future income tax benefits and payables within the same tax paying component of a particular  jurisdiction  are  offset  for  presentation  in  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet.  In  the  ordinary  course  of  business  there  is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions. We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years  subject  to  examination  based  upon  management's  evaluation  of  the  facts,  circumstances,  and  information  available  at  the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more-likely-than-not",

      "answer": "GD includes award fees in the estimated transaction price only when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount, based on historical award experience, anticipated performance, and management's best judgment. RTX, on the other hand, incorporates changes in award fees into its Estimate at Completion (EAC) adjustments, which reflect revisions to total estimated revenues and are included in segment Operating profit (loss). These adjustments may result from improved or deteriorated operating performance, changes in facts, or assumptions related to award fees associated with program performance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From GD's 10-K, we learn that award fees are included in contract estimates only when they can be reasonably estimated, using historical data, anticipated performance, and judgment.",
        "Step 2: From RTX's 10-K, we see that award fees are part of EAC adjustments, which affect Operating profit and are based on ongoing changes in performance, facts, and assumptions.",
        "Step 3: The synthesis reveals that both companies account for award fees in long-term contracts, but GD focuses on reasonable estimation at the point of revenue recognition, while RTX integrates award fee impacts dynamically through EAC adjustments during contract execution."

          "chunk_text": "Our performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in time. Revenue from products and services transferred to customers over time accounted for 78% of our revenue in 2021, 77% in 2020  and  73%  in  2019.  Substantially  all  of  our  revenue  in  the  defense  segments  is  recognized  over  time, because control is transferred continuously to our customers. Typically, revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts,  the  transfer  of  control  to  the  customer.  Contract  costs  include  labor,  material,  overhead  and,  when appropriate, G&amp;A expenses.\n\nRevenue from goods and services  transferred  to  customers  at  a  point  in  time  accounted  for  22%  of  our revenue in 2021, 23% in 2020 and 27% in 2019. Most of our revenue recognized at a point in time is for the manufacture of business jet aircraft in our Aerospace segment. Revenue on these contracts is recognized when the customer obtains control of the asset, which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the fully outfitted aircraft.\n\nOn December 31, 2021, we had $87.6 billion of remaining performance obligations, which we also refer to as  total  backlog.  We  expect  to  recognize  approximately  35%  of  our  remaining  performance  obligations  as revenue in 2022, an additional 35% by the end of 2024 and the balance thereafter.\n\nContract Estimates. The majority of our revenue is derived from long-term contracts and programs that can span several years. Accounting for long-term contracts and programs involves the use of various techniques to estimate total contract revenue and costs. For long-term contracts, we estimate the profit on a contract as the difference  between the total  estimated  revenue  and  expected  costs  to  complete  a  contract  and  recognize  that profit over the life of the contract.\n\nContract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that often span several years. These assumptions include labor productivity and availability; the complexity of the work to be performed; the cost and availability of materials; the performance of subcontractors; and the availability and timing of funding from the customer.\n\nThe nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including claims, award fees and incentive fees. We include in our contract estimates additional revenue for submitted contract modifications or claims against the customer when we believe we have an enforceable right to the modification or claim, the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable. In evaluating these criteria, we consider the contractual/legal basis for the claim, the cause of any additional costs incurred, the reasonableness of those costs and  the  objective  evidence  available  to  support  the  claim.  We  include  award  fees  or  incentive  fees  in  the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee. These estimates are based on historical award experience, anticipated performance and our best judgment at the time.\n\nAs a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts, we review  and  update  our  contract-related  estimates  regularly.  We  recognize  adjustments  in  estimated  profit  on contracts  under  the  cumulative  catch-up  method.  Under  this  method,  the  impact  of  the  adjustment  on  profit recorded to date on a contract is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified. Revenue and profit in future periods of contract performance are recognized using the adjusted estimate. If at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on the contract, we recognize the total loss in the period it is identified.",

      "answer": "A 10% across-the-board reduction in U.S. defense appropriations would directly impact both General Dynamics and Raytheon Technologies due to their heavy reliance on federal funding. For General Dynamics, which reported that 70% of its 2021 revenue came from the U.S. government, such a reduction could lead to program cuts, delays, or terminations, especially for multi-year contracts that depend on annual appropriations. This would disrupt revenue timing and potentially reduce contract values. Raytheon, with its exposure to fixed-price incentive (FPI) contracts, would face compounded risk because under FPI contracts, cost overruns beyond a negotiated ceiling are not recoverable. A reduction in appropriations could force RTX to absorb more costs without corresponding revenue increases, especially on complex development contracts where cost overruns are common. Both companies could see reduced profitability and liquidity challenges if they are unable to offset lost revenue or manage cost-sharing pressures under FPI and OTA contracts.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - General Dynamics reported that 70% of its 2021 revenue came from the U.S. government, and its financial performance is directly tied to congressional appropriations for multi-year contracts.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - A 10% reduction in defense appropriations would disrupt funding for GD's multi-year contracts and increase RTX's exposure to cost overruns, both leading to potential revenue shortfalls and profitability declines."

          "chunk_text": "## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nAn investment in our common stock or debt securities is subject to risks and uncertainties. Investors should consider the following factors, in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10K, before deciding whether to purchase our securities.\n\nInvestment risks can be market-wide as well as unique to a specific industry or company. The market risks faced  by  an  investor  in  our  stock  are  similar  to  the  uncertainties  faced  by  investors  in  a  broad  range  of industries. There are some risks that apply more specifically to our business.\n\nOur revenue is concentrated with the U.S. government. This customer relationship involves some specific risks. In addition, our sales to non-U.S. customers expose us to different financial and legal risks. Despite the varying nature of our government and commercial operations and the markets they serve, each segment shares some common risks, such as the ongoing development of high-technology products and the price, availability and quality of commodities and subsystems.\n\n## Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry\n\nThe  U.S.  government  provides  a  significant  portion  of  our  revenue. In  2021,  70%  of  our  consolidated revenue  was  from  the  U.S.  government.  Levels  of  U.S.  defense  spending  are  driven  by  threats  to  national security.  Competing  demands  for  federal  funds  can  pressure  various  areas  of  spending.  Decreases  in  U.S. government defense and other spending or changes in spending allocation or priorities could result in one or more of our programs being reduced, delayed or terminated, which could impact our financial performance.\n\nFor  additional  information  relating  to  U.S.  budget  matters,  see  the  Business  Environment  section  of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7.\n\nU.S.  government  contracts  are  not  always  fully  funded  at  inception,  and  any  funding  is  subject  to disruption or delay. Our U.S. government revenue is funded by agency budgets that operate on an October-toSeptember fiscal year. Early each calendar year, the President of the United States presents to the Congress the budget for the upcoming fiscal year. This budget proposes funding levels for every federal agency and is the result of months of policy and program reviews throughout the executive branch. For the remainder of the year, the Appropriations and Authorization Committees of the Congress review the President's budget proposals and establish the funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year. Once these levels are enacted into law, the Executive Office of the President administers the funds to the agencies.\n\nThere are two primary risks associated with the U.S. government budget cycle. First, the annual process may be delayed or disrupted. If the annual budget is not approved by the beginning of the government fiscal year, portions of the U.S. government can shut down or operate under a continuing resolution that maintains spending at prior-year levels, which can impact funding for our programs and timing of new awards. Second, the Congress typically appropriates funds on a fiscal-year basis, even though contract performance may extend over  many  years.  Future  revenue  under  existing  multi-year  contracts  is  conditioned  on  the  continuing availability  of  congressional  appropriations.  Changes  in  appropriations  in  subsequent  years  may  impact  the funding available for these programs. Delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of available funds or lead to changes in program content.\n\nOur  government  contracts  are  subject  to  termination  rights  by  the  customer. U.S.  government contracts  generally  permit  the  government  to  terminate  a  contract,  in  whole  or  in  part,  for  convenience.  If  a contract is terminated for convenience, a contractor usually is entitled to receive payments for its",

Significant changes in U.S. government defense spending or changes in U.S. government priorities, policies and requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\n\nWe Face Risks Relating to Our U.S. Government Contracts and the Mix of Our U.S. Government Contracts and Programs that Could Negatively Impact our Financial Condition, Results of Operations, Liquidity and Overall Business. The termination of one or more of our contracts, or the occurrence of performance delays, cost overruns, product failures, materials or components shortages,  or  contract  definitization  delays,  could  negatively  impact  our  competitive  position,  results  of  operations,  financial condition and liquidity. U.S. government contracts generally permit the government to terminate the contract, in whole or in part, without  prior  notice,  at  the  U.S.  government's  convenience  or  for  default  based  on  performance.  If  one  of  our  contracts  is terminated for convenience, we would generally be entitled to payments for our allowable costs and would receive some allowance for profit on the work performed. If one of our contracts is terminated for default, we would generally be entitled to payments for work accepted by the U.S. government. A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future contracts and orders. In addition, we are a subcontractor on some contracts and the U.S. government could terminate the prime contract for convenience or otherwise, without regard to our performance as a subcontractor. We can give no assurance that we would be awarded new U.S. government contracts to offset the revenues lost as a result of the termination  of  any  of  our  contracts.  In  addition,  because  the  funding  of  U.S.  government  programs  is  subject  to  congressional appropriations made on a fiscal year basis even for multi-year programs, programs are often only partially funded initially and may not continue to be funded in future years. Appropriation bills may be delayed, which may result in delays to funding, the collection of receivables and our contract performance due to lack of authorized funds to procure related products and services. Under certain circumstances, we may use our own funds to meet our customer's desired delivery dates or other requirements, but we may not be reimbursed. Further, if appropriations for one of our programs become unavailable, reduced or delayed, the U.S. government may terminate for  convenience our contract or subcontract under that program. In addition, our U.S. government contracts typically involve  the  development,  application  and  manufacture  of  advanced  defense  and  technology  systems  and  products  aimed  at achieving  challenging  goals.  New  technologies  may  be  untested  or  unproven  and  in  some  instances,  product  requirements  or specifications may be modified. As a result, we may experience technological and other performance difficulties, which may result in delays, setbacks, cost overruns or product failures, and could divert our attention or resources from other projects. Our failure to execute effectively on our development programs could impact our future sales opportunities. Additionally, in order to win certain U.S. government contracts, we may be required to invest in development prior to award as our customers demand more mature and proven solutions. These additional investments may not be worthwhile if we are not chosen for these awards.\n\nOur U.S. government contracts are typically either fixed-priced contracts or cost reimbursement contracts. Fixed-price contracts are predominantly either firm fixed-price (FFP) contracts or fixed-price incentive (FPI) contracts. Under FFP contracts, we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and we therefore carry the burden of any cost overruns. Under FPI contracts, we generally share with the U.S. government savings for cost underruns less than target costs and expenses for cost overruns exceeding target costs up to a negotiated ceiling price. We carry the entire burden of cost overruns exceeding the ceiling price amount under FPI contracts. Under cost reimbursable contracts, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fixed or performance-based fee, but  we  are  generally  not  reimbursed  for  unauthorized  costs  exceeding  a  cost  ceiling  amount  or  costs  not  allowable  under  the contract or applicable regulations. If we are unable to control costs or if our initial cost estimates are incorrect, our profitability could be negatively affected, particularly under fixed-price development contracts. We may also experience cost underruns which would reduce contract value and related expected revenues, and we may be unable to expand the contract scope or secure additional work to offset the resulting lost revenues. While contracts for development programs with complex design and technical challenges are  typically  cost  reimbursable,  they  can  be  FFP  or  FPI,  which  can  significantly  increase  our  risk  of  a  potential  negative  profit adjustment, as development contracts by nature involve elements that have not been undertaken before and, thus, are highly subject to  future  unexpected cost growth. In addition, other contracts in backlog are for the transition from development to production, which includes starting and stabilizing a manufacturing and test line while the final design is still being validated. Moreover, over the past several years, the DoD has increased its use of Other Transaction Authority (OTA) contracts, under which it awards certain prototypes, research and production contracts without all of the procurement requirements that typically apply to DoD contracts, including justification of sole source awards. OTAs may use fixed-price contracts during all phases of the contract, or mandated contract  cost  sharing  (e.g.,  one-third  of  program  costs).  They  may  also  require  non-traditional  subcontractor  participation  and impose other requirements that differ from our other DoD contracts. Our business may be negatively impacted if we are unable to perform on our OTA contracts, including any applicable non-traditional requirements. Moreover, from time to time, we may begin performance under an undefinitized contract action with a not-to-exceed price prior to completing contract negotiations in order to support U.S. government priorities. Uncertainties in final contract price, specifications and terms, or loss of negotiating leverage associated with particularly long delays in contract definitization, may negatively affect our profitability. In addition, as discussed more fully below, our U.S. government contracts also require us to comply with extensive and evolving procurement rules and regulations and subject us to potential U.S. government audits, investigations, and disputes.

      "answer": "The 2024 expected long-term rate of return on assets for FDX's U.S. pension plans is 6.50%, while the 2023 expected long-term rate of return on assets for LMT's qualified defined benefit pension plans is also 6.50%, resulting in no difference between the two. However, FDX's 2023 expected long-term rate of return on assets for international pension plans is significantly lower at 2.26%. Thus, while FDX and LMT maintain the same expected long-term rate of return on U.S./qualified pension assets, FDX's international pension plans have a much lower expected return compared to its domestic plans and to LMT's plans.",

      "answer": "FDX identifies the risk of loss or delay in the collection of accounts receivable as a potential negative impact on its business, citing regulatory and compliance risks that could affect cash flow. In contrast, LMT expresses confidence in collecting its receivables, noting that substantially all accounts receivable as of December 31, 2023, are expected to be collected in 2024. LMT reports receivables of approximately $1.4 billion from the U.S. Government and $749 million from other governments and commercial customers, indicating minimal credit risk due to the strong credit standing of the U.S. Government as the primary customer.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - FDX identifies 'loss or delay in the collection of accounts receivable' as a risk factor that could negatively impact its business.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - LMT reports receivables of $1.4 billion from the U.S. Government and $749 million from other governments and commercial customers as of December 31, 2023.",
        "Step 3: Extract from source B - LMT states that substantially all accounts receivable are expected to be collected in 2024 and does not believe it has significant exposure to credit risk due to the U.S. Government's involvement.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The contrast between FDX's concern over accounts receivable collection risk and LMT's confidence in collecting its receivables highlights different financial exposures related to the same financial metric, with LMT having a more secure receivables position due to its government contracts."

      "question": "How does the sensitivity of Lockheed Martin's (LMT) debt to interest rate changes contrast with the credit risk concerns highlighted by General Electric (GE) regarding short-term rates, and what does this imply about their respective exposures to macroeconomic volatility?",
      "answer": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) states that a 10% change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of its outstanding debt of $18.7 billion at December 31, 2023, indicating low sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations. In contrast, General Electric (GE) explicitly lists changes in short-term interest rates as a risk factor that could materially affect its business operations, financial results, and liquidity. GE also notes that downgrades in its credit ratings could significantly impact its funding profile and costs. This contrast implies that GE is more exposed to macroeconomic volatility related to interest rates, particularly due to its credit profile and sensitivity to short-term rate movements, whereas LMT has a more stable debt structure that is less affected by such changes.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A (GE) - GE lists changes in short-term interest rates and credit ratings as risk factors that could materially affect its financial results and liquidity.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B (LMT) - LMT states that a 10% change in interest rates would not materially affect its debt's fair value, with total debt of $18.7 billion at December 31, 2023.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The differing sensitivities to interest rate risk suggest that GE is more vulnerable to macroeconomic volatility, particularly in short-term rates, while LMT's financial structure is more resilient in this regard."

      "question": "How does the revenue-sharing mechanism in GE's Aerospace engine programs contrast with Lockheed Martin's experience on the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Program in terms of financial risk distribution and revenue dependency?",
      "answer": "GE's Aerospace revenue-sharing program involves third parties who share in program revenues, receive progress payments, and bear costs related to discounts and warranties, distributing financial risk among participants. In contrast, Lockheed Martin's Canadian Maritime Helicopter Program has led to concentrated financial risk, including a $100 million loss in Q2 2023, due to performance issues, lower-than-expected flight hours, and uncertainty in cost recovery. Unlike GE\u2019s shared model, Lockheed Martin bears significant unrecoverable costs and depends on future flight hours and government resources for revenue recovery, making its financial outcome more vulnerable to external performance and policy factors.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from GE's chunk - 'The participants share in program revenues, receive a share of customer progress payments and share costs related to discounts and warranties.' This shows a shared risk and revenue model.",
        "Step 2: Extract from LMT's chunk - 'we recognized a loss of $100 million ($75 million, or $0.29 per share, after-tax) on the program' and 'future sales and recovery of costs... are highly dependent upon achieving a certain number of flight hours.' This indicates concentrated risk and revenue uncertainty.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - GE distributes financial exposure across participants in its revenue-sharing model, whereas LMT bears the full brunt of cost overruns and revenue shortfalls, with recovery tied to uncertain operational and political factors."

      "answer": "In 2024, Honeywell had $4,273 million in commercial paper and other short-term borrowings, while Emerson reported $0 in this category. This indicates that Honeywell actively utilized short-term debt as part of its liquidity strategy, whereas Emerson did not rely on such borrowings, suggesting a more conservative approach to liquidity management with potentially greater reliance on internal cash resources.",

      "question": "What is the combined potential diminution in research, development, and engineering value if both EMR and HON experience material cybersecurity breaches, based on their respective risk disclosures?",
      "answer": "Based on the disclosures in both EMR and HON 10-K filings, both companies explicitly state that a material cybersecurity incident could lead to a diminution in the value of their investment in research, development, and engineering. While neither company quantifies the exact financial impact, the shared risk indicates that such breaches could significantly impair the value of their R&D portfolios, which are critical to maintaining competitive advantage and future revenue streams. Therefore, the combined potential diminution would represent a material loss to both companies' innovation assets and long-term strategic positioning.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from EMR_10k_2024.pdf - EMR states that cybersecurity incidents could lead to 'diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering.'",
        "Step 2: Extract from HON_10k_2024.pdf - HON similarly discloses that cybersecurity breaches could result in 'diminution in the value of our investment in research, development, and engineering.'",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both EMR and HON identify the same financial risk: cybersecurity incidents potentially eroding the value of their R&D investments. The question requires this shared risk to be recognized and synthesized to assess the combined impact on their innovation portfolios."

Cybersecurity incidents aimed at the software embedded in our products could lead to third-party claims resulting from damages caused by our product failures, and this risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected nature of our products. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include financial loss, reputational damage, litigation with third parties, diminution in the v alue of our inv estment in research, dev elopment and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats, which in turn could adv ersely affect our competitiv eness and results of operations.\n\n## Industry and General Economic Risks\n\nOur Substantial Sales Both in the U.S. and Abroad Subject Us to Economic Risk as Our Results of Operations May Be Adversely Affected by Changes in Government Regulations and Policies and Currency Fluctuations\n\nWe sell, manufacture, engineer and purchase products globally, with significant sales in both mature and emerging markets. We expect sales in nonU.S. markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales. Our U.S. and international operations subject the Company to changes in government regulations and policies in a large number of jurisdictions around the world, including those related to trade, inv estments, taxation, exchange controls and repatriation of earnings. Changes in laws or policies (including their interpretations) gov erning the terms of foreign trade, trade restrictions or barriers, tariffs or taxes, trade protection measures, and retaliatory countermeasures, including on imports from countries where we manufacture products, could adv ersely impact our business and financial results. In addition, changes in the relativ e v alues of currencies occur from time to time and have affected our operating results and could do so in the future. While we monitor our exchange rate exposures and attempt to mitigate this exposure through hedging activ ities, this risk could adv ersely affect our operating results.\n\n## Recessions, Adverse Market Conditions or Dow nturns in End Markets We Serve May Negatively Affect Our Operations\n\nIn the past, our operations hav e been exposed to significant v olatility due to changes in general economic conditions or consumer preferences, recessions or adv erse conditions in the end markets we serv e. In the future, similar changes could adv ersely impact ov erall sales, operating results (including potential impairment charges for goodwill or other long-liv ed assets) and cash flows. Moreov er, during economic downturns we may undertake more extensiv e restructuring actions, including workforce reductions, global facility consolidations, centralization of certain business support activ ities, and other cost reduction initiativ es, and incur higher costs. As these plans and actions can be complex, the anticipated operational improv ements, efficiencies and other benefits might be delayed or not realized.\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Risks\n\nChanges in Tax Rates, Law s or Regulations and the Resolution of Tax Disputes Could Adversely Impact Our Financial Results\n\nAs a global company, we are subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine our consolidated income tax prov ision and related liabilities. The Company's effectiv e tax rate, cash flows and operating results could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates, as well as by changes in the local tax laws and regulations, or the interpretations thereof, including multiple, ov erlapping tax regimes enacted as part of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Dev elopment proposals that implement a global minimum tax. In addition, the Company's tax returns are subject to regular rev iew and audit by U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities. While we believ e our tax prov isions are appropriate, the final outcome of tax audits or disputes could result in adjustments to the Company's tax liabilities, which could adv ersely affect our financial results.\n\nOur Reputation, Ability To Do Business and Results of Operations Could Be Impaired By Improper Conduct By Any of Our Employees, Agents or Business Partners\n\nWe are subject to regulation under a wide v ariety of U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. laws, regulations and policies, including laws related to anticorruption, anti-bribery, export and import compliance, anti-trust and money",

In addition, cybersecurity laws and regulations continue to evolve, and are increasingly demanding, both in the U.S. and globally , which adds compliance complexity and may increase our costs of compliance and expose us to reputational damage or litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, or fines in one or more jurisdictions. We cannot be certain that our cybersecurity insurance coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim.\n\n## The development of technology products and services presents security and safety risks.\n\nAn increasing number of our products, services, and technologies are delivered with IoT capabilities and the accompanying interconnected device networks, which include sensors, data, and advanced computing capabilities. We have developed product software designs that we believe are less susceptible to cyberattacks, but despite these efforts, if our products and services that include IoT solutions, inclusive of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, do not work as intended or are compromised, the possible consequences include financial loss, reputational damage, exposure to legal claims or enforcement actions, theft of intellectual property , and diminution in the v alue of our inv estment in research, development, and engineering, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.\n\n## Data privacy, data protection, and information security may require significant resources and present certain risks.\n\nWe collect, store, have access to, and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data, including proprietary business information, personal data, or other information that is subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and/or contractual obligations with third parties. Despite our efforts to protect such data, we may be vulnerable to material security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming errors, or human errors that could potentially lead to the compromise of such data, improper use of our products, systems, software solutions, or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes, and operational disruptions. A  significant actual or perceived risk of theft, loss, fraudulent use or misuse of customer, employee, or other data, whether by us, our suppliers, channel partners, customers, or other third parties, as a result of employee error or malfeasance, or as a result of the imaging, software, security , and other products we incorporate into our products, as well as non-compliance with applicable industry standards or our contractual or other legal obligations or privacy and information security policies regarding such data, could result in costs, fines, litigation, or regulatory  actions, or could lead customers to select the products and services of our competitors. In addition, we operate in an environment in which there are different and potentially conflicting laws in effect in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, and we must understand and comply with each law and standard in these jurisdictions while also ensuring the data is secure. M any of these laws impose stringent requirements as to how we collect, store, maintain, transfer, and otherwise process personal data and provide significant or material penalties for noncompliance. M any jurisdictions have passed or are considering laws that require personal data relating to their residents or citizens to be maintained or replicated on local servers or impose specific obligations related to extraterritorial data transfers. Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and actual or alleged violations of such laws, including in relation to the Company's processing of personal data or adoption of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, can result in fines, reputational damage, and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation, and financial statements.\n\n## A material disruption of our operations, particularly at our manufacturing facilities or within our IT infrastructure, could adversely affect our business.\n\nOur facilities, supply chains, distribution systems, and IT systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to natural disasters or other weather-related disruptions, including hurricanes and floods, which may be exacerbated by the effects of climate change, power outages, fires, explosions, terrorism, equipment failures, sabotage, cyber incidents, any potential effects of climate change and adverse weather conditions, including water scarcity and rising sea levels, labor disputes, critical supply failure, inaccurate downtime forecast, political disruption and regional conflicts, public health crises, like a regional or global pandemic, and other reasons, which can result in undesirable consequences, including financial losses and damaged relationships with customers. We employ IT systems and networks to support the business and rely on them to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. A lthough preventative measures may help to mitigate damage, such measures could be costly , and disruptions to our manufacturing facilities or IT infrastructure from sy stem failures, shutdowns, power outages and energy shortages, telecommunication or utility failures, cybersecurity incidents, and other events, including disruptions at our cloud computing, server, systems, and other third party IT service providers, could interfere with our operations, interrupt production and shipments, damage customer and business partner relationships, and negatively impact our reputation. In addition, the insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from any business interruption, including those resulting from a natural disaster or other severe weather event, and recurring extreme weather events or other adverse events could reduce the availability or increase the cost of insurance.\n\n33 Honeywell International Inc.",

      "question": "How does the treatment and impact of the FAS/CAS operating adjustment differ between LMT and RTX in their 2021 financial reporting, and what specific amounts illustrate these differences?",
      "answer": "In 2021, LMT reported a FAS/CAS operating adjustment of $1,960 million as part of its unallocated items, directly contributing to its consolidated operating profit of $9,123 million. This adjustment was a significant component of LMT's unallocated net total of $1,744 million. In contrast, RTX's FAS/CAS operating adjustment was embedded in its pension and PRB expense treatment, where the adjustment reconciled CAS expense (used for U.S. government contract pricing) with FAS service cost under GAAP. RTX noted that the FAS/CAS adjustment resulted in consolidated pension expense equal to the FAS service cost, though no specific dollar amount was provided for 2021. The difference lies in LMT explicitly quantifying the adjustment as a standalone unallocated item, while RTX integrated it within broader pension cost reporting without isolating its dollar impact.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From LMT's 2021 financials, extract the FAS/CAS operating adjustment of $1,960 million and its role in the total unallocated net amount of $1,744 million and consolidated operating profit of $9,123 million.",
        "Step 2: From RTX's 2021 reporting, identify the description of the FAS/CAS operating adjustment as the difference between CAS pension expense (used for government contracts) and FAS service cost under GAAP, noting the absence of a specific dollar figure for the adjustment.",
        "Step 3: Contrast the explicit, quantified treatment in LMT's reporting with RTX's more integrated and descriptive approach, highlighting the lack of a specific disclosed amount from RTX despite the adjustment's influence on consolidated pension expense."

The difference between our CAS expense and the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) service cost attributable to these segments under  U.S.  GAAP  is  the  FAS/CAS  operating  adjustment.  The  FAS/CAS  operating  adjustment  results  in  consolidated  pension expense in operating profit equal to the service cost component of FAS expense under U.S. GAAP. The segment results of Collins Aerospace and Pratt &amp; Whitney generally include FAS service cost.\n\nThe CAS expense calculation is different from the FAS requirements and calculation methodology. While the ultimate liability for pension costs under FAS and CAS is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. Our CAS pension expense is comprised primarily of CAS service cost, as well as amortization amounts resulting from demographic or economic experience different than expected, changes in assumptions, or changes in plan provisions. Unlike FAS, CAS expense is only recognized for plans that are not fully funded. Consequently, if plans become or cease to be fully funded under CAS due to our asset or liability experience, our CAS expense will change accordingly.",

      "answer": "The total cumulative reach-forward loss recognized by both BA and LMT in 2024 across their respective fixed-price defense contracts is $3,616 million. Boeing (BA) recognized $2,379 million in reach-forward losses on the KC-46A Tanker and $379 million on the VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, while Lockheed Martin (LMT) recognized $1,410 million on a classified MFC contract. Both companies face significant financial risk due to operational and contractual uncertainties: BA's losses were driven by supply chain constraints, factory disruptions, labor negotiations (IAM 751), and engineering design changes, while LMT's losses stemmed from the probable exercise of fixed-price options on a classified program, which they expect to perform at a loss.",

T otal capital inv estment was approximately $500 at December 31, 2024.\n\n## Fixed-Price Contracts\n\nLong-term contracts that are contracted on a fixed-price basis could result in losses in future periods. Certain of the fixed-price contracts are for the development of new products, serv ices and related technologies. Estimating the cost and time for us and our suppliers to complete these contracts is inherently uncertain due to operational and technical complexities. This uncertainty requires us to make significant judgments and assumptions about future operational and technical performance, and the outcome of customer and/or supplier contractual negotiations. The risk that actual performance, technical or contractual outcomes could be different than those prev iously assumed creates financial risk that could trigger additional material earnings charges, termination prov isions, order cancellations, or other financially significant exposure.\n\n## VC-25B Presidential Aircraft\n\nThe  Company's  firm  fixed-price  contract  for  the  Engineering  and  Manufacturing  Dev elopment  (EMD)  effort  on  the  U.S. Air  Force's  (USAF)  VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, commonly known as Air Force One, is a $4 billion program to dev elop and modify two 747-8 commercial aircraft. During 2024 and 2023, we increased the reach-forward loss on the contract by $379 and $482. During the second quarter of 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss on the  contract  by  $250  primarily  driv en  by  higher  than  anticipated  costs  due  to  engineering  design  changes  related  to  wiring  and  other  structural requirements. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss by $129 reflecting higher estimated costs due to engineering design changes and schedule delays. Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods.\n\n## KC-46A Tanker\n\nIn 2011, we were awarded a contract from the USAF to design, dev elop, manufacture, and deliv er four next generation aerial refueling tankers as well as priced options for 13 annual production lots totaling 179 aircraft. Since 2016, the USAF has authorized 11 low rate initial production (LRIP) lots for a total of 154 aircraft. The EMD contract and authorized LRIP lots total approximately $29 billion as of December 31, 2024. The KC-46A T anker is a deriv ativ e of the  767  commercial  airplane  program  with  the  majority  of  the  manufacturing  costs  being  incurred  in  the  767  factory  and  the  remaining  costs  being incurred in the military finishing and deliv ery centers.\n\nDuring 2024 and 2023, we increased the reach-forward loss on the KC-46A T anker program by $2,002 and $309. During the first quarter of 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss by $128, primarily due to factory disruption associated with supply chain constraints. During the second quarter of 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss on the contract by $391, primarily reflecting higher than anticipated factory disruption, including supply chain constraints and parts shortages. During the third quarter of 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss on the contract by $661 to reflect higher than anticipated  factory  disruption,  higher  estimated  supplier  costs,  the  projected  impacts  of  the  International Association  of  Machinists  and Aerospace Workers  District  751  (IAM  751)  contract  negotiations  and  the  ongoing  work  stoppage,  and  increased  cost  allocations  primarily  resulting  from  lower commercial airplane production rates. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we recorded an earnings charge of $822, primarily due to factory performance, higher estimated future production costs, and higher costs resulting from the IAM 751 work stoppage and new agreement. The fourth quarter charge also includes increased cost allocations from the decision to end production of the 767 freighter program and higher supplier costs. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $85 of capitalized precontract costs and $132",

Based on that review, we identified higher projected costs in engineering and integration activities that are necessary to achieve those forthcoming milestones. As of  December 31, 2024, cumulative losses recognized to date on this program were approximately $825  million.  We  will  continue  to proactively manage the technical requirements and our performance, the remaining work and any future changes in scope or schedule, and estimated costs to complete  the  program,  including  future  phases,  and  we  may  have  to  record  additional  losses  that  become  evident  in  future  periods  if  we  ex perience  further performance issues, increases in scope, or cost growth, which could be material to our financial results. We and our industry team will continue to incur advanced procurement costs (also referred to as pre-contract costs) to enhance our ability to achieve the schedule and certain milestones. We will monitor the recoverability of pre-contract costs, which could be impacted by our assessment of the customer's decision regarding the funding of future phases of the program.\n\nWe have contracted with the Canadian government for the CMHP at our RMS business segment that provides for design, development, and production of CH148 aircraft (the Original Equipment contract), which is a military variant of the S-92 helicopter, and for logistical support to the fleet (the In Service Support contract) over an extended time period. The last of the 28 CH-148 aircraft is scheduled to be delivered in 2025. The program has experienced performance issues, including delays  in  the  final  aircraft  deliveries  from  the  original  contract  requirement,  and  the  Royal  Canadian Air  Force's  flight  hours  have  been  significantly  less  than originally anticipated, which has impacted program revenues and the recovery of our costs under this program. We have incurred significant costs and recognized the related sales, of which about $955 million are currently included in contract assets on the balance sheet which could become at risk for future recovery. Such assets are recovered based on future flight hours, which are not entirely within our control and are dependent upon aircraft availability and performance and the availability of Canadian government resources. During 2024, we entered into a modification to the In Service Support contract to better align contract scope with the Canadian government's needs. This modification mitigates but does not eliminate the risk related to future sales and recovery of our costs. We continue to engage in discussions with the Canadian government to potentially restructure certain contractual terms and conditions that may be beneficial to both parties. However, any restructuring discussions may be prolonged or unsuccessful and are dependent upon Canadian government resources and priorities and other factors outside of our control. Under the contract terms as modified, future sales and recovery of costs are dependent upon the Royal Canadian Air Force's flight hours and program costs and performance. As of December 31, 2024, cumulative losses remained at approximately $100 million. Future performance issues or changes in our estimates may affect our ability to recover our costs, including recovery of the contract assets recognized on the balance sheet and our assessment of the reach-forward loss, which could be material to our operating results.\n\nWe also have a number of contracts with T\u00fcrkish industry for the T\u00fcrkish Utility Helicopter Program (TUHP), which anticipates co-production with T\u00fcrkish industry for production of T70 helicopters for use in T\u00fcrkiye, as well as the related provision of T\u00fcrkish goods and services under buy-back or offset obligations, to include the future sales of helicopters built in T\u00fcrkiye for sale globally. In 2020, the U.S. G overnment imposed certain sanctions on T\u00fcrkish entities and persons that have affected our ability to perform under the TUHP contracts, and we have provided force majeure notices under the affected contracts. We partially stopped work on TUHP effective October 5, 2024. We are currently in discussions with our customer regarding the path forward for the program in light of the continued impact of the sanctions on our ability to perform under the TUHP contracts and our decision to partially stop work. As of December 31, 2024, cumulative losses related to development work for the program remained insignificant and the program remains in a contract liability position on the balance sheet. The TUHP contracts may be negotiated to be restructured or terminated, either in whole or in part, and as a result, we could be at risk of recording significant reach-forward losses in future periods. Additionally, our customer and subcontractor have asserted that we do not have the contractual right to stop work. If we are unable to reach an agreement in the near term, we or our customer could elect to pursue other relief or remedies, which could result in a further reduction in sales, the imposition of penalties or assessment of damages, and increased unrecoverable costs, which could be material to our financial results.\n\nOur MFC business segment has been performing under a competitively bid classified contract, which includes a cost-reimbursable base contract for the initial phase of the program and multiple fixed-price options for additional phases. We previously disclosed that the options may be exercised over the next several years and if performed expect they would each be at a loss. During the first quarter of 2024, we concluded it was probable that the first option would be exercised and recognized a reach forward loss of approximately $100 million. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we again assessed the likelihood that additional options may be exercised and now believe it is probable that all options will be exercised based on performance to date, future requirements of the program, discussions with the customer and suppliers, and anticipated customer funding, among other factors, resulting in the recognition of additional reach-forward losses of approximately $1.31 billion.  For the year ended December 31, 2024, MFC recognized losses of $1.41 billion for this program, bringing the cumulative losses recognized on the program to approximately $1.46 billion, including charges for pre-contract costs recognized in prior periods. As of December 31, 2024, $1.36 billion of the losses were accrued in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.\n\nResearch and development and similar costs - We conduct research and development (R&amp;D) activities using our own funds (referred to as company-funded or independent R&amp;D (IR&amp;D)) and under contractual arrangements with our customers",

In July 2024, we obtained approv al from the FAA to begin the first phase of FAA certification flight testing. Flight testing was paused starting in August and resumed in January.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, based on flight test delays and our rev ised assessment of certification timelines, the anticipated first deliv ery of the 7779 was delayed to 2026 and the 777-8 Freighter mov ed to 2028. First deliv ery of the 777-8 passenger aircraft is not expected to occur before 2030. In addition, we decided to slow the production rate ramp of 777X  to address production challenges, which resulted in higher production costs and further customer deliv ery delays. As a result of these changes, as well as higher estimated labor and supplier costs, we recorded a $2,608 million reach-forward loss during the third quarter of 2024.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we recorded an additional reach-forward loss of $891 million on the 777X  program primarily due to higher costs as a result of the new IAM 751 agreement.\n\nWe are following the lead of the FAA as we work through the certification process and the ultimate timing will be determined by the regulators.\n\nThe lev el of profitability on the 777X  program will be subject to sev eral factors. T hese factors include aircraft certification requirements and timing, change incorporation on completed aircraft, production disruption due to labor instability and supply chain disruption, customer considerations, deliv ery timing and negotiations, further production rate adjustments for the 777X  or other commercial aircraft programs, and contraction of the accounting quantity. One or more of these factors could result in additional reach-forward losses in future periods.\n\n787 Program T he  accounting quantity for the 787 program increased by 100 units during the year ended December 31, 2024, due to the program's normal progress of obtaining additional orders and deliv ering airplanes. During 2024, we slowed production to below 5 per month due to supply chain constraints as well as other production issues.  While we continue to be impacted by performance challenges and supply chain constraints, we are working  to  increase  production  rates.  Delays  associated  with  business  class  seats  adv ersely  impacted  2024  deliv eries  and  will  continue  to  impact deliv eries in 2025. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 25 aircraft in inv entory that were produced prior to 2023 and required rework. We expect to complete the rework and deliv er the majority of these aircraft in 2025. T he inspections and rework costs on inv entoried aircraft are accounted for as abnormal production costs, and we expensed $256 million during the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\nFleet  Support We  prov ide  the  operators  of  our  commercial  aircraft  with  assistance  and  serv ices  to  facilitate  efficient  and  safe  airplane  operation. Collectiv ely known as fleet support serv ices, these activ ities and serv ices begin prior to airplane deliv ery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane. T hey include flight and maintenance training, field serv ice support, engineering serv ices, information serv ices and systems and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and hav e historically been approximately 1% of total consolidated costs of products and serv ices.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\nOn June 30, 2024, we entered into an agreement to acquire Spirit.

Based on that review, we identified higher projected costs in engineering and integration activities that are necessary to achieve those forthcoming milestones. As of  December 31, 2024, cumulative losses recognized to date on this program were approximately $825  million.  We  will  continue  to proactively manage the technical requirements and our performance, the remaining work and any future changes in scope or schedule, and estimated costs to complete  the  program,  including  future  phases,  and  we  may  have  to  record  additional  losses  that  become  evident  in  future  periods  if  we  ex perience  further performance issues, increases in scope, or cost growth, which could be material to our financial results. We and our industry team will continue to incur advanced procurement costs (also referred to as pre-contract costs) to enhance our ability to achieve the schedule and certain milestones. We will monitor the recoverability of pre-contract costs, which could be impacted by our assessment of the customer's decision regarding the funding of future phases of the program.\n\nWe have contracted with the Canadian government for the CMHP at our RMS business segment that provides for design, development, and production of CH148 aircraft (the Original Equipment contract), which is a military variant of the S-92 helicopter, and for logistical support to the fleet (the In Service Support contract) over an extended time period. The last of the 28 CH-148 aircraft is scheduled to be delivered in 2025. The program has experienced performance issues, including delays  in  the  final  aircraft  deliveries  from  the  original  contract  requirement,  and  the  Royal  Canadian Air  Force's  flight  hours  have  been  significantly  less  than originally anticipated, which has impacted program revenues and the recovery of our costs under this program. We have incurred significant costs and recognized the related sales, of which about $955 million are currently included in contract assets on the balance sheet which could become at risk for future recovery. Such assets are recovered based on future flight hours, which are not entirely within our control and are dependent upon aircraft availability and performance and the availability of Canadian government resources. During 2024, we entered into a modification to the In Service Support contract to better align contract scope with the Canadian government's needs. This modification mitigates but does not eliminate the risk related to future sales and recovery of our costs. We continue to engage in discussions with the Canadian government to potentially restructure certain contractual terms and conditions that may be beneficial to both parties. However, any restructuring discussions may be prolonged or unsuccessful and are dependent upon Canadian government resources and priorities and other factors outside of our control. Under the contract terms as modified, future sales and recovery of costs are dependent upon the Royal Canadian Air Force's flight hours and program costs and performance. As of December 31, 2024, cumulative losses remained at approximately $100 million. Future performance issues or changes in our estimates may affect our ability to recover our costs, including recovery of the contract assets recognized on the balance sheet and our assessment of the reach-forward loss, which could be material to our operating results.\n\nWe also have a number of contracts with T\u00fcrkish industry for the T\u00fcrkish Utility Helicopter Program (TUHP), which anticipates co-production with T\u00fcrkish industry for production of T70 helicopters for use in T\u00fcrkiye, as well as the related provision of T\u00fcrkish goods and services under buy-back or offset obligations, to include the future sales of helicopters built in T\u00fcrkiye for sale globally. In 2020, the U.S. G overnment imposed certain sanctions on T\u00fcrkish entities and persons that have affected our ability to perform under the TUHP contracts, and we have provided force majeure notices under the affected contracts. We partially stopped work on TUHP effective October 5, 2024. We are currently in discussions with our customer regarding the path forward for the program in light of the continued impact of the sanctions on our ability to perform under the TUHP contracts and our decision to partially stop work. As of December 31, 2024, cumulative losses related to development work for the program remained insignificant and the program remains in a contract liability position on the balance sheet. The TUHP contracts may be negotiated to be restructured or terminated, either in whole or in part, and as a result, we could be at risk of recording significant reach-forward losses in future periods. Additionally, our customer and subcontractor have asserted that we do not have the contractual right to stop work. If we are unable to reach an agreement in the near term, we or our customer could elect to pursue other relief or remedies, which could result in a further reduction in sales, the imposition of penalties or assessment of damages, and increased unrecoverable costs, which could be material to our financial results.\n\nOur MFC business segment has been performing under a competitively bid classified contract, which includes a cost-reimbursable base contract for the initial phase of the program and multiple fixed-price options for additional phases. We previously disclosed that the options may be exercised over the next several years and if performed expect they would each be at a loss. During the first quarter of 2024, we concluded it was probable that the first option would be exercised and recognized a reach forward loss of approximately $100 million. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we again assessed the likelihood that additional options may be exercised and now believe it is probable that all options will be exercised based on performance to date, future requirements of the program, discussions with the customer and suppliers, and anticipated customer funding, among other factors, resulting in the recognition of additional reach-forward losses of approximately $1.31 billion.  For the year ended December 31, 2024, MFC recognized losses of $1.41 billion for this program, bringing the cumulative losses recognized on the program to approximately $1.46 billion, including charges for pre-contract costs recognized in prior periods. As of December 31, 2024, $1.36 billion of the losses were accrued in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.\n\nResearch and development and similar costs - We conduct research and development (R&amp;D) activities using our own funds (referred to as company-funded or independent R&amp;D (IR&amp;D)) and under contractual arrangements with our customers",

      "question": "What is the total amount of reach-forward losses recognized by both Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) in 2024 for programs involving fixed-price contracts with the U.S. government, and how do their respective cost overruns and supplier-related issues contribute to these increases?",
      "answer": "In 2024, Boeing recognized a total of $3,099 million in reach-forward losses for the MQ-25 and T-7A Red Hawk programs, primarily due to production cost overruns and higher-than-anticipated supplier costs. Specifically, Boeing increased the reach-forward loss on the MQ-25 program by $339 million in the first quarter, $217 million in the third quarter, and $122 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. Additionally, Boeing increased the reach-forward loss on the T-7A Red Hawk program by $1,770 million in 2024, driven by higher estimated supplier costs, supplier negotiations, and increased costs to complete flight testing. Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin recognized $1.41 billion in reach-forward losses in 2024 for a classified contract under its MFC business segment, following the recognition of an additional $1.31 billion in losses in the fourth quarter due to the increased likelihood of all fixed-price options being exercised. These losses were attributed to cost growth and the structure of the fixed-price contract. Together, Boeing and Lockheed Martin recognized $4,509 million in reach-forward losses in 2024 for these programs.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Boeing increased the reach-forward loss on the MQ-25 program by $339 million in the first quarter, $217 million in the third quarter, and $122 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, totaling $678 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - Boeing increased the reach-forward loss on the T-7A Red Hawk program by $1,770 million in 2024, driven by supplier cost increases and flight test costs.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b - Lockheed Martin recognized $1.41 billion in reach-forward losses in 2024 for a classified contract, including $1.31 billion in the fourth quarter due to the likelihood of all fixed-price options being exercised.",
        "Step 4: Sum total reach-forward losses from both companies - $678 million (Boeing MQ-25) + $1,770 million (Boeing T-7A) + $1.41 billion (Lockheed Martin classified contract) = $4,509 million.",
        "Step 5: Identify contributing factors - Boeing's increases were driven by supplier cost overruns and production complexity; Lockheed Martin's increases were due to cost growth and fixed-price contract structure."

During 2024, we increased the reachforward loss by $339. During the third quarter of 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss by $217 primarily reflecting higher than anticipated production costs to complete EMD aircraft.

In July 2024, we obtained approv al from the FAA to begin the first phase of FAA certification flight testing. Flight testing was paused starting in August and resumed in January.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, based on flight test delays and our rev ised assessment of certification timelines, the anticipated first deliv ery of the 7779 was delayed to 2026 and the 777-8 Freighter mov ed to 2028. First deliv ery of the 777-8 passenger aircraft is not expected to occur before 2030. In addition, we decided to slow the production rate ramp of 777X  to address production challenges, which resulted in higher production costs and further customer deliv ery delays. As a result of these changes, as well as higher estimated labor and supplier costs, we recorded a $2,608 million reach-forward loss during the third quarter of 2024.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we recorded an additional reach-forward loss of $891 million on the 777X  program primarily due to higher costs as a result of the new IAM 751 agreement.\n\nWe are following the lead of the FAA as we work through the certification process and the ultimate timing will be determined by the regulators.\n\nThe lev el of profitability on the 777X  program will be subject to sev eral factors. T hese factors include aircraft certification requirements and timing, change incorporation on completed aircraft, production disruption due to labor instability and supply chain disruption, customer considerations, deliv ery timing and negotiations, further production rate adjustments for the 777X  or other commercial aircraft programs, and contraction of the accounting quantity. One or more of these factors could result in additional reach-forward losses in future periods.\n\n787 Program T he  accounting quantity for the 787 program increased by 100 units during the year ended December 31, 2024, due to the program's normal progress of obtaining additional orders and deliv ering airplanes. During 2024, we slowed production to below 5 per month due to supply chain constraints as well as other production issues.  While we continue to be impacted by performance challenges and supply chain constraints, we are working  to  increase  production  rates.  Delays  associated  with  business  class  seats  adv ersely  impacted  2024  deliv eries  and  will  continue  to  impact deliv eries in 2025. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 25 aircraft in inv entory that were produced prior to 2023 and required rework. We expect to complete the rework and deliv er the majority of these aircraft in 2025. T he inspections and rework costs on inv entoried aircraft are accounted for as abnormal production costs, and we expensed $256 million during the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\nFleet  Support We  prov ide  the  operators  of  our  commercial  aircraft  with  assistance  and  serv ices  to  facilitate  efficient  and  safe  airplane  operation. Collectiv ely known as fleet support serv ices, these activ ities and serv ices begin prior to airplane deliv ery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane. T hey include flight and maintenance training, field serv ice support, engineering serv ices, information serv ices and systems and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and hav e historically been approximately 1% of total consolidated costs of products and serv ices.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\nOn June 30, 2024, we entered into an agreement to acquire Spirit.

Restricted stock awards involve distribution of common stock to key management employees subject to cliff vesting at the end of service periods ranging from three to ten years while restricted stock units granted to employees cliff vest at the end of a three-year period. The fair value of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is determined based on the average of the high and low market prices of the Company's common stock on the date of grant, with compensation expense recognized ratably over the applicable vesting period. In 2022, approximately 116,000 shares of restricted stock vested as a result of participants fulfilling the applicable service requirements. Consequently, approximately 76,000 shares were issued while 40,000 shares were withheld for income taxes in accordance with minimum withholding requirements. As of September 30, 2022, there were approximately 1,272,000 shares of unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units outstanding.\n\nIn addition to the employee stock option and incentive shares plans, in 2022 the Company awarded approximately 19,000 shares of restricted stock under the restricted stock plan for non-management directors. As of September 30, 2022, approximately 79,000 shares were available for issuance under this plan.\n\nAs of September 30, 2022, 3.8 million shares remained available for award under incentive shares plans.\n\nChanges in shares outstanding but not yet earned under incentive shares plans during the year ended September 30, 2022 follow (shares in thousands; assumes 100 percent payout of unvested awards):\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "business. A reporting unit is an operating segment as defined in ASC 280, Segment Reporting , or a business one level below an operating segment if discrete financial information for that business unit is prepared and regularly reviewed by the segment manager. The Company conducts annual impairment tests of goodwill in the fourth quarter. If an initial assessment indicates it is more likely than not goodwill might be impaired, it is evaluated by comparing the reporting unit's estimated fair value to its carrying value. An impairment charge would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value. Goodwill is also tested for impairment between annual tests if events or circumstances indicate the fair value of a unit may be less than its carrying value. Estimated fair values of reporting units are Level 3 measures and are developed generally under an income approach that discounts estimated future cash flows using risk-adjusted interest rates, as well as earnings multiples or other techniques as warranted. Fair values are subject to changes in underlying economic conditions.\n\nAll of the Company's identifiable intangible assets are subject to amortization on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Identifiable intangibles consist of intellectual property such as technology, patents and trademarks, customer relationships and capitalized software. Identifiable intangibles are also subject to evaluation for potential impairment if events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. See Note 8.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe Company leases offices; manufacturing facilities and equipment; and transportation, information technology and office equipment under operating lease arrangements. Finance lease arrangements are immaterial. The Company determines whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at contract inception. An arrangement contains a lease if the Company has the right to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of an identified asset. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at lease commencement based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet and are recorded as short-term lease expense. The discount rate used to calculate present value is the Company's incremental borrowing rate based on the lease term and the economic environment of the applicable country or region.\n\nCertain leases contain renewal options or options to terminate prior to lease expiration, which are included in the measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities when it is reasonably certain they will be exercised. The Company has elected to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for its offices and manufacturing facilities. Some lease arrangements include payments that are adjusted periodically based on actual charges incurred for common area maintenance, utilities, taxes and insurance, or changes in an index or rate referenced in the lease. The fixed portion of these payments is included in the measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at lease commencement, while the variable portion is recorded as variable lease expense. The Company's leases typically do not contain material residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.\n\n## Product Warranty\n\nWarranties vary by product line and are competitive for the markets in which the Company operates. Warranties are largely offered to provide assurance that the product will function as intended and generally extend for a period of one to two years from the date of sale or installation. Provisions for warranty expense are estimated at the time of sale based on historical experience and adjusted quarterly for any known issues that may arise. Product warranty expense is less than one-half of one percent of sales.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nEmerson is a global manufacturer that designs and manufactures products and delivers services that bring technology and engineering together to provide innovative solutions for its customers, largely in the form of tangible products. The Company evaluates its contracts with customers to identify the promised goods or services and recognizes revenue for the identified performance obligations at the amount the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. Revenue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied and control has transferred to the customer, typically when products are shipped or delivered, title and risk of loss pass to the customer, and the Company has a present right to payment. The majority of the Company's revenues relate to a broad offering of manufactured products which are recognized at the point in time when control transfers, generally in accordance with shipping terms. A portion of the Company's revenues relate to the sale of software and post-contract customer support, parts and labor for repairs, and engineering services. In some circumstances,",

      "answer": "Union Pacific's 2023 10-K highlights that fuel surcharge programs trail fuel price fluctuations by approximately two months, leading to volatility in operating results. FedEx's 2023 10-K explicitly states that they experienced 'lower fuel surcharges at all of our transportation segments' in 2024, which negatively affected their yields and results of operations. As fuel prices fluctuate, Union Pacific's delayed surcharge mechanism creates instability in surcharge revenue, which FedEx is directly experiencing. This dynamic undermines FedEx\u2019s ability to maintain stable revenue from fuel surcharges, especially in a volatile fuel pricing environment.",

      "question": "How does the difference in fuel surcharge mechanisms between FedEx and Union Pacific affect their respective abilities to manage fuel cost volatility, given FedEx adjusts weekly and Union Pacific experiences a two-month lag in surcharge recovery?",
      "answer": "FedEx applies fuel surcharges on both air and ground services that are adjusted weekly (with some international FedEx Express surcharges updated monthly), allowing it to more closely align surcharge revenue with current fuel prices. In contrast, Union Pacific notes that its fuel surcharge programs trail fuel price fluctuations by approximately two months, which can lead to volatility in quarterly and yearly results, especially during periods of rapid fuel price changes. This difference in fuel surcharge responsiveness means FedEx can more quickly pass fuel cost increases to customers, while Union Pacific faces a built-in delay that may expose it to more financial risk during volatile fuel markets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - FedEx adjusts fuel surcharges on a weekly basis (monthly for some international services), directly linking surcharge rates to recent fuel prices.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Union Pacific states that its fuel surcharge programs trail fuel price fluctuations by approximately two months, contributing to quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year volatility.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The difference in timing of surcharge adjustments affects each company's ability to recover rising fuel costs. FedEx\u2019s more frequent adjustments provide better real-time cost recovery, while Union Pacific\u2019s two-month lag introduces exposure to short-term fuel price volatility."

This modernization is expected to reduce fuel costs, a major component of operating expenses. Meanwhile, UNP focuses on improving operational fluidity to increase fuel efficiency and is modernizing locomotives for improved reliability and fuel consumption, using renewable fuels, and exploring low- and zero-emissions propulsion technologies. These initiatives align with UNP\u2019s broader environmental strategy and 'Sustainable Future' goals. While both companies aim to reduce fuel consumption, FDX's approach centers on fleet modernization for cost savings, whereas UNP integrates fuel efficiency with broader sustainability and emissions reduction targets.",

      "answer": "FedEx Express experienced a 20% decrease in fuel expense during 2024, primarily driven by lower fuel prices and usage, with contractual arrangements mitigating the impact of volatile daily spot rates. Union Pacific Railroad, on the other hand, saw a decrease in fuel expense in 2023 due to lower locomotive diesel fuel prices, which averaged $3.09 per gallon compared to $3.65 in 2022, resulting in a $0.5 billion decrease in expense. FedEx's reduction is expressed as a relative percentage (20%), reflecting its exposure to jet fuel prices and usage patterns, while Union Pacific's reduction is quantified as an absolute dollar amount ($0.5 billion), reflecting its diesel consumption and operational scale. This contrast highlights differences in how fuel expense volatility impacts two major transportation companies based on their mode of transport, fuel type, and purchasing structures.",

      "answer": "UNP reported a property-related deferred income tax liability of $12,987 million in 2023, indicating a significant tax obligation tied to property. In contrast, CAT recognized right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for property leases, using its incremental borrowing rate to calculate present value, but did not report a comparable deferred tax liability related to property. This suggests that while both companies engage with property through leasing or ownership, their financial reporting strategies differ, with UNP carrying a substantial deferred tax burden from property, whereas CAT focuses on lease asset/liability recognition.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From UNP's 10-K, extract the 2023 property-related deferred income tax liability of $12,987 million.",
        "Step 2: From CAT's 10-K, extract the methodology for recognizing property lease liabilities, including the use of incremental borrowing rates and right-of-use assets, with no mention of deferred tax liabilities related to property.",
        "Step 3: Compare the two approaches: UNP's deferred tax liability reflects a tax impact of property ownership, while CAT's lease accounting focuses on asset/liability recognition without a direct tax impact mentioned."

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe expected dividend yield is based on recent historical dividend yields for our stock, taking into account changes in dividend policy. The risk-free interest rate is based on the term structure of interest rates at the time of the option grant. The ex pected life represents an estimate of the period of time options are ex pected to remain outstanding. In determining this, we have relied upon a combination of the observed exercise behavior of our prior grants with similar characteristics and the contractual term of the grants. Ex pected volatilities are based on the historical returns on our stock and the implied volatility of our publicly-traded options.\n\nWe received cash of $3, $20 and $14 million during 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, from option holders resulting from the exercise of stock options. The total intrinsic value of options ex ercised during 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $2, $15 and $20 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, there was $3 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested options. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of three years and five months.\n\n## Discounted Employee Stock Purchase Plan\n\nWe maintain an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible employees. Under this plan, shares of UPS class A common stock may be purchased at quarterly intervals at 95% of the NYSE closing price of UPS class B common stock on the last day of each quarterly period. Employees purchased 0.8, 0.7 and 0.6 million shares at average prices of $130.14, $162.34 and $180.80 per share, during 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

UPS also reported a decrease in fuel expense, driven by lower jet and ground fuel costs, but did not disclose a specific dollar amount. While both companies experienced fuel cost reductions, only UNP provided a quantified figure, making a direct numerical comparison impossible.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOperating expenses decreased $500 million, or 3%, in  2024 compared to2023 driv en by lower fuel prices, productiv ity, a gain on the sale of intermodal equipment in 2024, partially offset by inflation, volume-related costs, and higher depreciation. In addition, positiv ely impacting the year-ov er-year comparison are lower labor agreement ratification  charges  as  we  reached  agreements  impacting  crew staffing  in  both  years,  and  lower  weather-related  costs  from  less impactful  winter  weather  in  the  first  quarter  of  2024  compared  to 2023.\n\n## 2024 Operating Expenses\n\nCompensation and Benefits - Compensation and benefits include wages, payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension costs, and incentiv e costs. In 2024, expenses increased 2% compared to 2023 due to wage inflation, which includes the impact of labor agreements to modernize work rules and improve av ailability, higher incentiv e compensation, and increased crew needs associated with labor agreements and increased v olumes, partially offset by 4% lower employee lev els. Train, engine, and yard (TE&amp;Y) force lev els were flat compared to 2023 as improv ed network fluidity allowed us to handle a 3% increase in v olumes and the increased needs associated with labor agreements without increasing the size of that workforce.\n\nPurchased Services and Materials - Expense for purchased serv ices and materials includes the costs of serv ices purchased from outside contractors and other serv ice prov iders (including equipment maintenance and contract expenses incurred by our subsidiaries for external transportation serv ices); materials  used  to  maintain  the  Railroad's  lines,  structures,  and  equipment;  costs  of  operating  facilities  jointly  used  by  UPRR  and  other  railroads; transportation and lodging for train crew employees; trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers; leased automobile maintenance expenses; and  tools  and  supplies.  Purchased  serv ices  and  materials  decreased  4%  in  2024compared  to2023driv en  by  declines  in  locomotiv e  maintenance expense due to a smaller activ e fleet as productiv ity improv ed year-ov er-year, decreased v olume-related drayage cost incurred at one of our subsidiaries, and a fav orable contract settlement, partially offset by inflation and v olume-related costs.\n\nFuel - Fuel includes locomotiv e fuel and gasoline for highway and non-highway v ehicles and heav y equipment. Fuel expense decreased compared to 2023 due to a decrease in locomotiv e diesel fuel prices, which av eraged $2.64 per gallon (including taxes and transportation costs) in 2024 compared to $3.09  per  gallon  in  2023,resulting  in  a  $0.4  billion  decrease  in  expense  (excluding  any  impact  from  decreased  v olumesyear-ov er-year),  and  a  1% improvement to the fuel consumption rate in 2024 (computed as gallons of fuel consumed div ided by gross ton-miles), partially offset by a 1% increase in gross ton-miles.\n\nDepreciation - The majority of depreciation relates to road property, including rail, ties, ballast, and other track material. Depreciation expense was up 3% in 2024 compared to 2023 due to a higher depreciable asset base.\n\nEquipment and Other Rents - Equipment and other rents expense primarily includes rental expense that the Railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or priv ate companies; freight car, intermodal, and locomotiv e leases; and office and other rent expenses, offset by equity income from certain equity method inv estments. Equipment and other rents expense decreased 3% compared to 2023due to lower lease expense and improv ed cycle times, partially offset by increased demand in commodities utilizing freight cars owned by others and inflation.\n\nOther -Other expenses include state and local taxes;freight, equipment, and property damage;utilities;insurance;personal injury;env ironmental;employee trav el;telephone and cellular;computer software;bad debt;and other general expenses. Other expenses decreased 8% in2024compared to2023driven by lower personal injury costs, a 2024 gain on the sale of intermodal equipment, and a 2023 write-off, partially offset by higher freight loss and damage and other casualty cost.\n\n## Non-Operating Items\n\n",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Operating Expenses\n\nOperating expenses and non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses increased year over year. Pickup and delivery costs increased $1.1 billion and package sortation costs increased $291 million, slightly offset by a $173 million decrease in the costs of operating our integrated air and ground network, a decrease in other operating costs of $53 million and the impact from one less operating day in 2024 compared to 2023.\n\nThe cost increases were primarily due to an increase of $1.4 billion in compensation and benefits expense which was driven by the impact of wage and benefit rate increases for our union workforce under our contract with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (\"IBT\"), which became effective August 1, 2023. Thirdparty delivery costs for our SurePost product increased $213 million due to higher SurePost volume.\n\nThe cost decreases were primarily due to a reduction in fuel expense, driven by decreases in the cost of jet and ground fuel, a decrease in worker's compensation expense and the impact of reductions in our workforce under our Fit to Serve initiative.\n\nAs of the fourth quarter of 2024, U.S. air cargo operating ex pense is presented within our U.S. Domestic Package segment and prior periods have been recast.\n\nOur non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses in this segment exclude the impact of total transformation strategy costs of $147 million, a pre-tax charge to withdraw from a multiemployer pension plan of $19 million and asset impairment charges of $5 million. Total transformation strategy costs within the segment during 2024 were related to our Fit to Serve, Transformation 2.0 and Efficiency Reimagined programs. Within these programs, we incurred compensation and benefits costs related to workforce reductions as we right-size our business. Additionally, within Transformation 2.0 and Efficiency Reimagined , we incurred costs related to outside professional service providers. For additional information on these enterprise programs, our expected benefits and the related costs, see 'Supplemental Information - Items Affecting Comparability'.\n\nCost per piece increased 0.6% for the year and non-GAAP adjusted cost per piece increased 0.8%, as expense increases, driven by an increase in compensation and benefits expense, outpaced growth in average daily volume. Cost per piece is expected to increase during 2025 as we expect to incur costs to further our strategic initiatives and we ex pect average daily volume to decrease as discussed above.\n\n## Operating Profit and Margin\n\nAs a result of the factors described above, operating profit decreased $811 million, with operating margin decreasing 140 basis points to 7.2%. Non-GAAP adjusted operating profit decreased $967 million, with non-GAAP adjusted operating margin decreasing 160 basis points to 7.5%.",

      "answer": "Caterpillar mentions that Medicare Part D subsidy amounts expected to be received by the company will offset other postretirement benefit payments, though it does not specify a dollar amount. In contrast, Lockheed Martin explicitly reports receiving a $4 million Medicare Part D subsidy in 2022, which contributes to offsetting its retiree medical and life insurance plan obligations. This difference reveals that while both companies participate in the Medicare Part D subsidy program to reduce retiree healthcare costs, Lockheed Martin's more direct and quantified use of the subsidy plays a clearer role in its pension funding strategy, helping to reduce the unfunded status of its retiree medical plans from $186 million in 2020 to a positive $330 million in 2022.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From Caterpillar's filing, we learn that Medicare Part D subsidies are expected to offset other postretirement benefit payments, but no specific dollar amount is provided.",
        "Step 2: From Lockheed Martin's filing, we extract a specific $4 million Medicare Part D subsidy received in 2022 for its retiree medical plans.",
        "Step 3: We also observe that Lockheed Martin's retiree medical plans went from an unfunded status of $186 million in 2020 to a funded status of $330 million in 2022, indicating a significant improvement partially attributable to the subsidy.",
        "Step 4: Synthesizing both pieces, we conclude that while both companies benefit from Medicare Part D subsidies, Lockheed Martin's explicit subsidy and resulting improvement in retiree plan funding highlights a more active role for the subsidy in its pension funding strategy compared to Caterpillar."

The  expected  benefit  payments  for  our  other postretirement benefits include payments for prescription drug benefits. The above table also includes Medicare Part D subsidy amounts expected to be received by the company which will offset other postretirement benefit payments.\n\n## D. Plan assets\n\nIn  general,  our  strategy  for  both  the  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  pensions  includes  ongoing  alignment  of  our  investments  to  our liabilities, while reducing risk in our portfolio. The current U.S. pension target asset allocation is 85 percent fixed income and 15 percent equities. We will revise this target allocation periodically to ensure it reflects our overall objectives. The non-U.S. pension  weighted-average  target  allocations  are  82  percent  fixed  income,  10  percent  equities,  5  percent  real  estate  and  3 percent  other.    The  target  allocations  for  each  plan  vary  based  upon  local  statutory  requirements,  demographics  of  plan participants and funded status.  We primarily invest the non-U.S. plan assets in non-U.S. securities.\n\nOur target allocation for the other postretirement benefit plans is 70 percent equities and 30 percent fixed income.\n\nWe rebalance the U.S. plans to within the appropriate target asset allocation ranges on a monthly basis.  The frequency of rebalancing  for  the  non-U.S.  plans  varies  depending  on  the  plan. As  a  result  of  our  diversification  strategies,  there  are  no significant concentrations of risk within the portfolio of investments.\n\nWe permit the use of certain derivative instruments where appropriate and necessary for achieving overall investment policy objectives.  The plans do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes.\n\nThe accounting guidance on fair value measurements specifies a fair value hierarchy based upon the observability of inputs used in valuation techniques (Level 1, 2 and 3). Certain assets that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. See Note 18 for a discussion of the fair value hierarchy.",

      "answer": "Caterpillar utilizes a mark-to-market approach, recognizing actuarial gains or losses immediately through earnings upon the annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter or on an interim basis if triggering events occur. This results in full recognition of any valuation changes in the period they occur, directly impacting earnings volatility. In contrast, Lockheed Martin amortizes actuarial gains or losses over time, as shown by the changes recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, which includes both the actual return versus expected return on plan assets and changes in the fair value of the benefit obligation. This amortization approach spreads the financial statement impact across multiple periods rather than recognizing it all at once, leading to smoother earnings.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From Caterpillar's 10-K, we learn they use a mark-to-market approach, recognizing actuarial gains or losses immediately through earnings during the annual remeasurement or on an interim basis.",
        "Step 2: From Lockheed Martin's 10-K, we see that they recognize changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, which includes actuarial gains or losses, and that these are amortized over time rather than immediately impacting earnings.",
        "Step 3: By comparing both approaches, we can conclude Caterpillar's method leads to immediate earnings volatility, while Lockheed Martin's amortization results in a more gradual financial statement impact."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nFor  reporting  units  where  we  perform  a  quantitative  goodwill  impairment  test,  the  process  requires  valuation  of  the  respective reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on a discounted five year forecasted cash flow with a year-five residual value. We compute the residual value using the constant growth method, which values the forecasted cash flows in perpetuity. The assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on each reporting unit's long-term forecast and are subject to review and approval by senior management. A reporting unit's discount rate is a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of  capital,  which  we  believe  approximates  the  rate  from  a  market  participant's  perspective.  The  estimated  fair  value  could  be impacted  by  changes  in  market  conditions,  interest  rates,  growth  rates,  tax  rates,  costs,  pricing  and  capital  expenditures.  We categorize the fair value determination as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs.\n\nWe completed our annual assessment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2021 and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill. Caterpillar's market capitalization has remained significantly above the net book value of the Company.\n\nAn unfavorable change in our expectations for the financial performance of our reporting units, particularly long-term growth and profitability, would reduce the fair value of our reporting units. The demand for our equipment and related parts is highly cyclical and significantly impacted by commodity prices, although the impact may vary by reporting unit. The energy and mining industries are major users of our products, including the mineral extraction, oil and natural gas industries. Decisions to purchase our products are  dependent  upon  the  performance  of  those  industries,  which  in  turn  are  dependent  in  part  on  commodity  prices.  Lower commodity prices or industry specific circumstances that have a negative impact to the valuation assumptions may reduce the fair value of our reporting units. Should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value has fallen below its carrying value, we will perform an interim goodwill impairment test(s), in addition to the annual impairment test. Future impairment tests may result in a goodwill impairment, depending on the outcome of the quantitative impairment test. We would report a goodwill impairment as a non-cash charge to earnings.\n\nWarranty liability - At  the  time  we  recognize  a  sale,  we  record  estimated  future  warranty  costs.    We  determine  the  warranty liability  by  applying  historical  claim  rate  experience  to  the  current  field  population  and  dealer  inventory.    Generally,  we  base historical claim rates on actual warranty experience for each product by machine model/engine size by customer or dealer location (inside or outside North America).  We develop specific rates for each product shipment month and update them monthly based on actual warranty claim experience.  Warranty costs may differ from those estimated if actual claim rates are higher or lower than our historical rates.\n\nProduct liability and insurance loss reserve - We determine these reserves based upon reported claims in process of settlement and actuarial estimates for losses incurred but not reported. Loss reserves, including incurred but not reported reserves, are based on estimates and ultimate settlements may vary significantly from such estimates due to increased claims frequency or severity over historical  levels.  The  amount  of  these  reserves  totaled  $1.2  billion  at  both  December  31,  2021  and  2020.  The  majority  of  the balance in both 2021 and 2020 consisted of unearned insurance premiums.\n\nPostretirement  benefits -  We  sponsor  defined  benefit  pension  plans  and/or  other  postretirement  benefit  plans  (retirement healthcare  and  life  insurance)  to  employees  in  many  of  our  locations  throughout  the  world.  There  are  assumptions  used  in  the accounting for these defined benefit plans that include discount rate, expected return on plan assets, expected rate of compensation increase, the future health care trend rate, mortality and other economic and demographic assumptions. The actuarial assumptions we use may change or differ significantly from actual results, which may result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions are considered actuarial gains or losses. We utilize a mark-to-market approach in recognizing actuarial gains or losses immediately through earnings upon the annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement.",

In contrast, LMT's fixed-price contracts require them to absorb cost fluctuations, as profits depend on meeting cost estimates\u2014variations lead to higher or lower profits or even losses. This shows CAT used pricing power to mitigate cost pressures, while LMT managed risks through internal cost control under fixed-price terms.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - CAT's strategy involved adjusting prices to offset rising costs, directly improving profit, while LMT's model exposed it to cost risks without pricing flexibility, revealing contrasting approaches to managing supply chain and inflationary pressures."

Mark-to-market  gains  for  remeasurement  of pension and other postemployment benefit (OPEB) plans,  a  lower  effective  tax  rate,  favorable  impacts  from  foreign currency exchange  (gains)  losses  and  lower  restructuring  expenses  were  mostly  offset  by  unfavorable manufacturing  costs and  higher selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) and research and development (R&amp;D) expenses.\n\nFourth-quarter 2021 sales and revenues were $13.798 billion, up $2.563 billion, or 23 percent, from $11.235 billion in the fourth quarter  of  2020.  Fourth-quarter  2021  profit  was  $3.91  per  share,  compared  with  $1.42  per  share  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020. Fourth-quarter 2021 profit was $2.120 billion, compared with $780 million in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\n## Response to COVID-19 and Global Business Conditions:\n\nWe continue to monitor a variety of external factors including the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic around the world and  have  implemented  safeguards  in  our  facilities  to  protect  team  members  in  line  with  local  governmental  requirements  and guidance from health authorities.\n\nOperations continue to be impacted by a variety of external factors including the pandemic, supply chain disruptions and associated cost  and  labor  pressures. Areas  of  particular  focus  include  certain  components,  transportation  and  raw  materials. Transportation shortages  have  resulted  in  delays  and  increased  costs.  In  addition,  our  suppliers  are  dealing  with  availability  issues  and  freight delays, which leads to delays of production in our facilities. We continue to develop and modify contingency plans to minimize supply chain challenges that may impact our ability to meet increasing customer demand. To help mitigate supply chain challenges, we have proactively redirected components and altered our assembly processes. We continue to assess the environment and are taking appropriate price actions in response to rising costs. We will continue to monitor the situation as conditions remain fluid and evolve, but we expect these challenges to continue this year.",

(a)\n\nAt  December  31,  2021,  third-party  guarantees  totaled  $838  million,  of  which  approximately  69%  related  to  guarantees  of contractual  performance  of  joint  ventures  to  which  we  currently  are  or  previously  were  a  party.  These  amounts  represent  our estimate  of  the  maximum  amounts  we  would  expect  to  incur  upon  the  contractual  non-performance  of  the  joint  venture,  joint venture partners or divested businesses. Generally, we also have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a joint venture partner.\n\nIn determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, performance on contractual obligations, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current and former joint venture partners and the transferee under novation agreements all of which include a guarantee as required by the FAR. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no material amounts recorded in our financial statements related to third-party guarantees or novation agreements.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies\n\n## Contract Accounting / Sales Recognition\n\nThe majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. Government and international customers (including  FMS  contracted  through  the  U.S.  Government)  for  the  research,  design,  development,  manufacture,  integration  and sustainment  of  advanced  technology  systems,  products  and  services.  We  account  for  a  contract  when  it  has  approval  and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance  and  collectability  of  consideration  is  probable.  For  certain  contracts  that  meet  the  foregoing  requirements,  primarily international direct commercial sale contracts, we are required to obtain certain regulatory approvals. In these cases, we recognize revenue when it is probable that we will receive regulatory approvals based upon all known facts and circumstances. We provide our products and services under fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts.\n\nUnder fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fixedprice  contracts  have  a  performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance.\n\nCost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. Typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: costplus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-fixed-fee. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within  specified  limits  based  on  the  customer's  assessment  of  our  performance  against  a  predetermined  set  of  criteria,  such  as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e., incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e.,",

The change was primarily driven by favorable foreign currency impacts, favorable impacts from pension and other postemployment benefit (OPEB) plan costs and higher mark-to-market gains for remeasurement of pension and OPEB plans.\n- The effective tax rate for 2024 was 19.7 percent compared to 21.3 percent for 2023. Excluding the discrete items discussed below, the annual effective tax rate was 22.2 percent for 2024 compared to 21.4 percent for 2023. The increase from 2023 was primarily related to changes in the geographic mix of profits from a tax perspective.\n- In 2024, the company recorded a discrete tax benefit of $224 million for a tax law change related to currency translation. The 2024 annual effective tax rate excludes the impact of losses of $164 million for the divestitures of certain non-U.S. entities with related tax  benefits of $54 million. The 2023 annual effective tax rate ex cludes the impact of the nondeductible loss of $586 million related to the divestiture of the company's Longwall business. The company also recorded a tax charge of $43 million related to $154 million of mark-to-market gains for remeasurement of pension and OPEB plans in 2024, compared to a tax charge of $26 million related to $97 million of mark-to-market gains in 2023. In 2024, the company recorded discrete tax benefits of $47 million to reflect changes in estimates related to prior years. In addition, a discrete tax  benefit of $57 million was recorded in 2024 and 2023 for the settlement of stock-based compensation awards with associated tax deductions in excess of cumulative U.S. GAAP compensation expense. In 2023, the company recorded a discrete tax benefit of $88 million due to a change in the valuation allowance for certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets.\n\n## Construction Industries\n\nConstruction Industries' total sales were $25.455 billion in 2024, a decrease of $1.963 billion, or 7 percent, compared with $27.418 billion in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume. The decrease in sales volume was mainly driven by lower sales of equipment to end users.\n\n- In North America, sales decreased due to lower sales volume. Lower sales volume was primarily driven by the impact from changes in dealer inventories. Dealer inventory increased less during 2024 than during 2023.\n- Sales increased in Latin America primarily due to higher sales volume, partially offset by unfavorable price realization and unfavorable currency impacts primarily related to the Brazilian real. Higher sales volume was mainly driven by the impact from changes in dealer inventories. Dealer inventory increased during 2024, compared with a decrease during 2023.\n- In EAME, sales decreased primarily due to lower sales volume. Lower sales volume was mainly due to lower sales of equipment to end users.\n- Sales decreased in Asia/Pacific primarily due to lower sales volume and unfavorable currency impacts, primarily related to the Japanese yen. Lower sales volume was mainly driven by the impact from changes in dealer inventories. Dealer inventory decreased during 2024, compared with an increase during 2023.\n\nConstruction Industries' profit was $6.165 billion in 2024, a decrease of $810 million, or 12 percent, compared with $6.975 billion in 2023. The decrease was mainly due to the profit impact of lower sales volume.\n\nConstruction Industries' profit as a percent of total sales was 24.2 percent in 2024, compared with 25.4 percent in 2023.\n\n## Resource Industries\n\nResource Industries' total sales were $12.389 billion in 2024, a decrease of $1.194 billion, or 9 percent, compared with $13.583 billion in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume, partially offset by favorable price realization. Sales volume decreased primarily due to lower sales of equipment to end users.\n\nResource Industries' profit was $2.533 billion in 2024, a decrease of $301 million, or 11 percent, compared with $2.834 billion in 2023. The decrease was mainly due to the profit impact of lower sales volume of $655 million, partially offset by favorable price realization of $405 million.\n\nResource Industries' profit as a percent of total sales was 20.4 percent for 2024, compared with 20.9 percent for 2023.",

Meanwhile, RTX faces profit risks due to ongoing challenges in hiring qualified personnel, high labor costs, and potential delays in obtaining security clearances, which could affect performance on U.S. government contracts.

Our defense business in particular requires qualified personnel with security clearances due to our classified programs. As portions of our workforce continue to retire and we lose experienced personnel in the future, it is critical that we develop other employees, hire new qualified personnel, and successfully manage the transfer of critical skillsets and industry knowledge within our workforce.\n\nWe have experienced, and continue to experience, challenges hiring highly qualified personnel including engineers, skilled laborers, and security clearance holders. We expect  these  difficulties  to  continue  in  the  future.  In  addition,  the  cost  of  labor  remains  high.  Some  candidates  and  new  personnel  may  have  job-related expectations that differ from our current workforce and are inconsistent with our corporate culture. With respect to existing personnel, some may become required to receive various security clearances and substantial training in order to work on certain programs or perform certain tasks. Necessary security clearances may be delayed, which may impact our ability to perform on our U.S. government contracts. We also may not be successful in training or developing qualified personnel with the requisite relevant skills or security clearances. Moreover, some of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Historically, we have been able to renegotiate expiring agreements without experiencing significant disruptions to business operations. However, the U.S. labor environment has experienced shifts, and if we have additional challenges renegotiating agreements or if our employees pursue new collective representation, then we could experience additional costs and/or be subject to work stoppages. Any of the above factors could seriously harm our business.\n\nMoreover, we believe that a critical element of our ability to successfully attract, train, and retain qualified personnel is our corporate culture, which we believe fosters innovation, collaboration, and a focus on execution, all in an environment of high ethical standards. Our global operations may present challenges in maintaining these important aspects of our corporate culture, and a failure to maintain our corporate culture could negatively impact us. Further, we rely on our key personnel to lead with integrity and to meet our high ethical standards that promote excellent performance. To the extent any of our key personnel were to behave in a way that is inconsistent with our values, including with respect to product safety or quality, legal or regulatory compliance, financial reporting, or people management, we could experience a materially adverse impact to our reputation and our operating results.  In addition, failure or perceived failure to meet stakeholder expectations on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters could harm our reputation and impact demand for our products and services.\n\nExports and imports of certain of our products are subject to various export control, sanctions, and import regulations and may require authorization from regulatory agencies of the U.S. or other countries. We must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export and import of products, services, and technology from and into the U.S. and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations. In the U.S., these laws and regulations include, among others, the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and Arms Export Control Act (AECA) provisions administered by the U.S. Department of State (DOS), embargoes and sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and import regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). Certain of our products, services, and technologies have military or strategic applications and are on the U.S. Munitions List of the ITAR, the Commerce Control List of the EAR, or are otherwise subject to the EAR and/or the U.S. Munitions Import List, and we are required to obtain licenses and authorizations from the appropriate U.S. government agencies before exporting these products out of the  U.S. or importing these products into the  U.S.  U.S. foreign policy or the foreign policy of other licensing jurisdictions may affect the licensing process or otherwise prevent us from engaging in business dealings with certain individuals, entities, or countries. From time to time, we identify, investigate, remediate and voluntarily disclose violations or potential violations of the ITAR and EAR. Any failure by us, our customers, or our suppliers to comply with the above-referenced laws and regulations, arising out of our voluntary disclosures or otherwise, could result in civil or criminal penalties, fines, seizure of our products, adverse publicity, restrictions on our ability to engage in export or import transactions, or the suspension or debarment from doing business with the  U.S.  government.  Moreover,  any  changes  in  export  control,  sanctions,  or  import  regulations  may  further  restrict  the  ex port  or  import  of  our products or services, and the possibility of such changes requires constant monitoring to ensure we remain compliant. Our ability to obtain required licenses and authorizations on a timely basis, or at all, is subject to risks and uncertainties, including changing laws, regulations, or foreign policies, delays in Congressional action, or geopolitical and other factors. If we are not successful in obtaining or maintaining the necessary licenses or authorizations in a timely manner, our sales relating to those approvals may be prevented or delayed, and revenue and profit previously recognized may be reversed. Any restrictions on the export or import of our products or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\n\nIn addition, as previously disclosed, on August 29, 2024, the Company entered into a Consent Agreement (CA) with the DOS to resolve alleged civil violations of the AECA and the ITAR. The CA, which has a three-year term, requires the Company to implement remedial compliance measures and to conduct an external audit of the Company's ITAR compliance program. The",

RTX, on the other hand, notes that potential cleanup liabilities from environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and cash flow.

In contrast, RTX reported $62 million in divestiture costs specifically related to the pending sale of its actuation and flight control business, suggesting a more targeted but still significant divestiture effort. The broader scope of 3M's divestiture activities, involving multiple legal, operational, and transitional elements, likely contributed to higher complexity compared to RTX's more focused business disposition.",

      "answer": "EMR incurred $249 million in additional intangibles amortization in 2023 due to the Heritage AspenTech acquisition, which directly reduced its earnings and contributed to a 3.1 percentage point decline in the Software and Control segment margin. This reflects EMR's treatment of acquired intangibles as finite-lived assets that are amortized over their useful lives, consistent with BA's policy of straight-line amortization for finite-lived intangible assets such as developed technology (4\u201314 years), product know-how (6\u201330 years), and customer base (3\u201317 years). Both companies follow similar accounting mechanisms for amortization, which affects their earnings in proportion to the value and duration of the acquired intangible assets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From EMR's 10-K, identify the $249 million incremental intangibles amortization expense tied to the Heritage AspenTech acquisition and its impact on earnings and margin.",
        "Step 2: From BA's 10-K, extract the amortization policy for finite-lived intangible assets, including specific asset categories and their estimated useful lives.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the two by recognizing that both companies apply amortization to finite-lived intangibles, and EMR\u2019s specific expense reflects this practice, impacting its financial results similarly to how BA would recognize amortization expenses over time."

      "question": "How does the difference in amortization strategies between BA's finite-lived intangible assets (with lives ranging from 3 to 32 years) and EMR's $560 million intangibles amortization expense from the Test & Measurement acquisition reflect contrasting approaches to managing post-acquisition financial impacts?",
      "answer": "BA employs a structured amortization approach for finite-lived intangible assets, systematically amortizing developed technology (4-14 years), product know-how (6-30 years), customer base (3-17 years), distribution rights (3-27 years), and other assets (1-32 years) on a straight-line basis. This reflects a long-term, predictable strategy for recognizing acquisition costs. In contrast, EMR incurred a substantial $560 million intangibles amortization expense specifically tied to the Test & Measurement acquisition in 2024, indicating a more immediate financial impact from recent acquisition activity. EMR's approach shows a concentrated post-acquisition financial burden affecting current earnings, while BA's approach distributes amortization impacts more gradually across various asset classes and time horizons.",

      "question": "How does the impact of intangibles amortization from the Test & Measurement acquisition affect the earnings of the Software and Control segment at EMR, and how does this compare to BA's treatment of intangible assets in terms of financial reporting?",
      "answer": "The intangibles amortization from the Test & Measurement acquisition reduced the earnings of EMR's Software and Control segment by $560 million, causing a 6.4 percentage-point margin decline. This is a direct financial impact from the acquisition-related amortization expense. In contrast, BA treats finite-lived intangible assets by amortizing them on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives (e.g., developed technology from 4 to 14 years, customer base from 3 to 17 years), and does not amortize indefinite-lived intangibles such as brand names or IPR&D until they are completed and reclassified. Therefore, while EMR explicitly reports the negative earnings impact from amortization, BA integrates amortization into its broader asset management and impairment testing framework without specifying a direct earnings hit from a single acquisition.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From EMR's 10-K, the Software and Control segment experienced a $560 million impact from incremental intangibles amortization related to the Test & Measurement acquisition, which caused a 6.4 percentage-point margin decline.",
        "Step 2: From BA's 10-K, finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives (e.g., 4\u201314 years for developed technology, 3\u201317 years for customer base), while indefinite-lived intangibles are not amortized but tested for impairment annually.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize \u2014 EMR reports a direct, quantified financial impact from intangibles amortization on segment earnings, whereas BA follows a more generalized amortization policy without specifying a current earnings impact from a particular asset or acquisition."

Combining both changes: $3.3 billion (BA increase) - $0.169 billion (GD decrease) = $3.131 billion net increase across both companies. This reflects positively on BA's cash flow, as cash provided by Advances and Progress Billings was $3.4 billion in 2024, compared to only $0.1 billion in 2022, indicating a strong improvement in cash inflows tied to billings.

T he change in Inv entories was primarily driv en by increased production on the 737 and 777X programs, partially offset by increased deliv eries for the 787 program in 2023. T he change in Accrued liabilities was primarily driv en by higher accrued losses on BDS fixed-price dev elopment programs recorded in the prior year. Cash prov ided by Adv ances and progress billings was $3.4 billion in 2023 as compared with $0.1 billion in 2022. Concessions paid to 737 MAX  customers totaled $0.4 billion in 2023 and $1.0 billion in 2022.\n\nPayables to suppliers who elected to participate in supply chain financing programs decreased by $0.2 billion in 2024, and increased by $0.4 billion and $0.2 billion in 2023 and 2022. Supply chain financing is not material to our ov erall liquidity.\n\nInvesting Activities Cash used by inv esting activ ities during 2024 was $12.0 billion, compared with cash used of $2.4 billion during 2023 and cash prov ided by inv estment activ ities of $4.4 billion during 2022. T he increase in cash used in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to net contributions to inv estments of $9.1 billion in 2024 compared to $0.7 billion in 2023. T he increase in cash outflows in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to net contributions to inv estments of $0.7 billion in 2023 compared to net proceeds from inv estments of $5.6 billion in 2022. Capital expenditures totaled $2.2 billion in 2024, compared with $1.5 billion in 2023 and $1.2 billion in 2022. We expect capital expenditures to grow in 2025 compared with 2024.\n\nFinancing Activities Cash provided by financing activ ities was $25.2 billion during 2024, compared with cash used of $5.5 billion during 2023, and $1.3 billion  in  2022.  Cash  prov ided  by  financing  activ ities  during  2024  was  primarily  driv en  by  the  issuance  of  common  stock  and  Mandatory  conv ertible preferred stock in the fourth quarter of 2024, which resulted in cash proceeds of $18.2 billion and $5.7 billion, net of issuance costs, as well as the issuance  of  $10.0  billion  of  fixed-rate  senior  notes  in  the  second  quarter  of  2024.  During  2024,  net  borrowings  were  $1.5  billion  compared  to  net repayments of $5.1 billion and $1.3 billion in 2023 and 2022.\n\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023 debt balances totaled $53.9 billion and $52.3 billion, of which $1.3 billion and $5.2 billion were classified as short-term.\n\nWe had 0.4 million,  1.7  million  and  0.2  million  shares  transferred  to  us  from  employee  tax  withholdings  in  2024,  2023  and  2022,  respectiv ely.  T he increase in 2023 was primarily due to the v esting of a one-time RSU grant awarded to most employees in December 2020. In 2020, we announced the suspension of our div idend to common shareholders until further notice. As a result, we did not pay any div idends to common shareholders in 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## Capital Resources\n\nThe following table summarizes certain cash requirements for known contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2024, and the estimated timing thereof.

      "question": "Given Boeing's accounting treatment for advances and progress billings as contract liabilities, how does General Dynamics' $32.4B in advances and progress billings relative to its $40.6B in unbilled revenue suggest about the timing and risk distribution in its contract execution process?",
      "answer": "Boeing explains that Advances and Progress Billings are contract liabilities that arise when payments are received before revenue is recognized, often due to U.S. government contracts that withhold payment until completion. These are not considered significant financing components but rather protections for both parties. General Dynamics reports $32.4B in advances and progress billings and $40.6B in unbilled revenue as of December 31, 2024. This indicates that GD has received substantial advance payments but has not yet delivered on all associated obligations (reflected in unbilled revenue). Boeing's framework suggests GD's position reflects a contract execution phase where it is holding customer funds (advances) while still needing to fulfill performance obligations (unbilled revenue), which may signal earlier-stage contracts with deferred delivery and revenue recognition.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From Boeing's 10-K, we extract the explanation that Advances and Progress Billings represent contract liabilities where payments are received before revenue is recognized, often on long-term government contracts.",

The U.S. gov ernment customer typically withholds payment of a small portion of the contract price until contract completion. T herefore, long-term contracts typically generate Unbilled receiv ables (contract assets) but may generate Advances and progress billings (contract liabilities). Long-term contract Unbilled receiv ables and Adv ances and progress billings are not considered a significant financing component because they are intended to protect either the customer or the Company in the ev ent that some or all of the obligations under the contract are not completed.\n\nCommercial spare parts contracts Certain contracts at our BGS segment include sales of commercial spare parts. For each contract, we determine the  transaction  price  based  on  the  consideration  expected  to  be  receiv ed.  T he  spare  parts  hav e  discrete  unit  prices  that  represent  fair  v alue.  We generally  consider  each  spare  part  to  be  a  separate  performance  obligation.  Rev enue  is  recognized  for  each  commercial  spare  part  performance obligation  at  the  point  in  time  of  deliv ery  to  the  customer .  We  may  prov ide  our  customers  with  a  right  to  return  a  commercial  spare  part  where  a customer may receive a full or partial refund, a credit applied to amounts owed, a different product in exchange, or any combination of these items. We consider  the  potential  for  customer  returns  in  the  estimated  transaction  price.  T he  amount  reported  as  cost  of  sales  is  recorded  at  av erage  cost. Payments for commercial spare parts sales are typically receiv ed shortly after deliv ery.\n\nOther service revenue contracts Certain contracts at our BGS segment are for sales of serv ices to commercial customers including maintenance, training, data analytics and information-based serv ices. We recognize rev enue for these serv ice performance obligations ov er time as the serv ices are rendered. The method of measuring progress (such as straight-line or billable amount) v aries depending upon which method best depicts the transfer of control to the customer based on the type of serv ice performed. Cost of sales is recorded as incurred.\n\nConcession sharing arrangements We account for sales concessions to our customers in consideration of their purchase of products and serv ices as a reduction of the transaction price and the rev enue that is recognized for the related performance obligations. T he sales concessions incurred may be partially reimbursed by certain suppliers in accordance with concession sharing arrangements. We record these reimbursements, which are presumed to represent reductions in the price of the v endor's products or serv ices, as a reduction in Cost of products.\n\nUnbilled receivables and advances and progress billings Unbilled receiv ables (contract assets) arise when the Company recognizes rev enue for amounts which cannot yet be billed under terms of the contract with the customer. Adv ances and progress billings (contract liabilities) arise when the Company receives payments from customers in advance of recognizing rev enue. The amount of Unbilled receiv ables or Adv ances and progress billings is determined for each contract.\n\nFinancial services revenue We record financial serv ices rev enue associated with sales-type leases, operating leases and loans in Sales of serv ices on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For sales-type leases, we recognize selling profit or loss at lease inception if collection of the lease payments is probable. For sales-type leases, we record financing receiv ables at lease inception. A financing receiv able is recorded at the aggregate of future lease payments, estimated residual v alue of the leased equipment, and any deferred incremental direct costs less unearned income. Income is recognized ov er the life of the lease to approximate a lev el rate of return on the net inv estment. For",

We believe that adjusting Corporate &amp; Other costs to exclude the effects of items that are not closely associated with ongoing operations provides management and investors with a meaningful measure that increases the period-to-period comparability of our ongoing corporate costs.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024 , rev enue decreased by $0.2 billion compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to higher intercompany eliminations, partially offset by an increase in our run-off insurance operations revenue. Corporate &amp; Other operating profit decreased by $4.3 billion due to $5.2 billion of lower gains on retained and sold ownership interests and other equity securities, primarily related to our GE HealthCare and A erCap investments, $0.3 billion of higher restructuring and other charges, and $0.3 billion of goodwill impairments, related to our Colibrium A dditive reporting unit, partially  offset by  $0.7 billion of higher profit in our run-off insurance operations primarily  from improv ed inv estment results, positiv e claims ex perience and higher premium rate increases, $0.5 billion of higher gains on sales of business interests, primarily related to the sale of our non-core licensing business and prior year valuation allowance losses related to the planned sale of the Electric Insurance business and $0.2 billion of lower separation costs.\n\nAdjusted Corporate &amp; Other operating costs* decreased primarily due to a reduction in our functional costs and favorability from higher bank interest, partially  offset by  higher intercompany eliminations, primarily resulting from additional intercompany engine parts sales volume in our Propulsion &amp; Additive Technologies business.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, revenue increased by $0.2 billion compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to a $0.4 billion increase in our run-off insurance operations revenue, partially offset by $0.2 billion of higher intercompany eliminations. Corporate &amp; Other operating profit increased by $5.8 billion due to $5.7 billion of higher gains on retained and sold ownership interests, primarily related to our GE HealthCare and A erCap investments, partially offset by the nonrecurrence of prior year gains on our Baker Hughes investment. Corporate &amp; Other operating profit also increased as a result of $0.3 billion of lower restructuring and other charges, $0.1 billion of higher profit in our run-off insurance operations, and $0.1 billion of lower charges from contracts and recoverability of assets in connection with the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, partially offset by $0.1 billion of higher valuation allowance losses related to the planned sale of the Electric Insurance business and $0.1 billion higher separation costs.\n\nAdjusted Corporate &amp; Other operating costs* increased primarily due to higher EHS costs and higher intercompany eliminations primarily resulting from additional intercompany engine part sales volume in our Propulsion &amp; A dditive Technologies business partially offset by a reduction in our functional costs and favorability  from higher bank interest.\n\n## OTHER CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION\n\nRESTRUCTURING AND SEPARATION COSTS. Significant, higher-cost restructuring programs, primarily related to the separations, are excluded from measurement of segment operating performance for internal and external purposes; those excluded amounts are reported in Restructuring and other charges for Corporate. In addition, we incur costs associated with separation activities, which are also excluded from measurement of segment operating performance for internal and external purposes. See Note 20 for further information on restructuring and separation costs.\n\nINTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL CHARG ES were $1.0 billion, $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion for the y ears ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to lower average borrowing balances. The primary component of interest and other financial charges is interest on short- and long-term borrowings.\n\nDEBT EXTING UISHMENT COSTS were zero, zero, and $0.5 billion, for the y ears ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 respectively. There were no debt tenders in 2024 and 2023.\n\nPOSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. Refer to Note 13 for information about our pension and retiree benefit plans.\n\n",

      "question": "What specific tax-related reconciliation process is described in both GD's and UPS's 2022 10-K filings, and why is this process important for understanding the difference between the statutory federal income tax rate and the effective income tax rate?",
      "answer": "Both GD and UPS describe the reconciliation process from the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate in their 2022 10-K filings. GD specifically notes that differences arise because some income and expense items are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting than for income tax purposes, and that state and local income taxes allocable to U.S. government contracts are included in operating costs and expenses rather than in the tax provision. UPS also outlines a similar reconciliation for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019. This reconciliation is important because it helps explain how the effective tax rate is derived from the statutory rate by accounting for timing differences and other adjustments, providing a clearer picture of the company's actual tax burden.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A (GD_10k_2022.pdf:page_66:chunk_1) - GD explains that the tax provision differs from taxes paid due to timing differences in financial reporting vs. tax recognition, and that state and local taxes on U.S. government contracts are included in operating costs.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B (UPS_10k_2022.pdf:page_146:chunk_5) - UPS provides a reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective rate for the years 2021, 2020, and 2019.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies disclose a reconciliation process from the statutory to effective tax rate, with GD providing specific reasons for the variance (timing differences and contract-related tax allocations), while UPS provides the framework for such a reconciliation over a multi-year period."

      "answer": "General Dynamics calculates ROIC by excluding goodwill impairments and non-economic accounting changes, as ROIC is based on operating performance separate from tax considerations tied to the statutory federal income tax rate. In contrast, UPS provides a reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to its effective tax rate, which includes adjustments for items like state income taxes and tax credits, directly linking the statutory rate to actual tax outcomes. These differences show that while GD focuses on operational performance by excluding non-economic factors, UPS integrates the statutory rate into a broader tax impact analysis.",

      "question": "How do GD's and UPS's 2022 pension contribution strategies contrast, given GD's required $40 contribution versus UPS's absence of required minimums and its planned $1.9 billion discretionary contribution?",
      "answer": "GD had a required pension contribution of approximately $40 in 2022 and also considers making discretionary contributions to optimize tax deductibility and contract recovery. In contrast, UPS had no anticipated required minimum cash contributions to its qualified U.S. pension plans in 2022 and planned a significantly larger discretionary contribution of $1.9 billion. This highlights a stark contrast in scale and mandatory funding obligations between the two companies' pension strategies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From GD's 10-K filing, extract the required pension contribution amount of $40 for 2022 and the company's policy of making discretionary contributions to optimize tax and contract benefits.",
        "Step 2: From UPS's 10-K filing, extract the absence of anticipated required minimum contributions and the planned $1.9 billion discretionary contribution to its U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans in 2022.",
        "Step 3: Compare the two approaches, emphasizing the mandatory funding requirement at GD versus the entirely discretionary, yet much larger, contribution at UPS, revealing contrasting pension funding strategies."

The  principal  factors  affecting  the  benefits  earned  by participants in our pension plans are employees' years of service and compensation levels. Our primary U.S. pension plans, which comprise the majority of our unfunded obligation, were closed to new salaried participants on January 1, 2007, and were closed to new hourly participants in subsequent collective bargaining agreements over the next several years. Additionally, we have made several changes to these plans for certain participants that limit or cease the benefits that accrue for future service.\n\nIn addition to pension benefits, we maintain plans that provide post-retirement healthcare and life insurance coverage for certain employees and retirees. These benefits vary by employment status, age, service and salary level at retirement. The coverage provided and the extent to which the retirees share in the cost of the program vary throughout the company. The plans provide health and life insurance benefits only to those employees who retire directly from our service and not to those who terminate service prior to eligibility for retirement.\n\nContributions. It  is  our  policy  to  fund  our  qualified  pension  plans  in  a  manner  that  optimizes  the  tax deductibility  and  contract  recovery  of  contributions  considered  within  our  capital  deployment  framework. Therefore,  we  may  make  discretionary  contributions  in  addition  to  the  required  contributions  determined  in accordance  with  IRS  regulations. We  contributed  $135  to  our  qualified  pension  plans  in  2021.  In  2022,  our required contributions are approximately $40.\n\nWe  maintain  several  tax-advantaged  accounts,  primarily  Voluntary  Employees'  Beneficiary  Association (VEBA) trusts,  to  fund  the  obligations  for  some  of  our  other  post-retirement  benefit  plans.  For  non-funded plans, claims are paid as received. Contributions to our other post-retirement benefit plans were not material in 2021 and are not expected to be material in 2022.\n\nBenefit Payments. We expect the following benefits to be paid from our defined benefit plans over the next 10 years:\n\n",

We expect to fund these obligations and other discretionary payments, including expected returns to shareowners, primarily through cash from operations.\n\nWe anticipate making discretionary contributions to our company-sponsored U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans of approximately $1.9 billion in 2022, which are included within Expected employer contributions to plan trusts shown in note 6 to the audited, consolidated financial statements. There are currently no anticipated required minimum cash contributions to our qualified U.S. pension plans. The amount of any minimum funding requirement, as applicable, for these plans could change significantly in future periods depending on many factors, including plan asset returns, discount rates, other actuarial assumptions, changes to pension plan funding regulations and the discretionary contributions that we make. Actual contributions made in future years could materially differ and consequently required minimum contributions beyond 2022 cannot be reasonably estimated.\n\nAs discussed in note 7 to the audited, consolidated financial statements, we are not currently subject to any minimum contributions or surcharges with respect to the multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans in which we participate. Contribution rates to these multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans are established through the collective bargaining process.\n\nWe have outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds that are discussed in note 10 to the audited, consolidated financial statements. Additionally, we have $2.0 billion of fixed- and floating-rate senior notes that mature in 2022. We may repay these amounts when due with cash generated from operations or other borrowings, depending on various factors. Annual principal payments on our long-term debt, estimated debt interest obligations and purchase commitments are also set out in note 10.\n\nIncluded within purchase commitments as disclosed in note 10, we have firm commitments to purchase two new Boeing 7478F aircraft to be delivered in 2022 and 19 new Boeing 767-300 aircraft to be delivered between 2023 and 2025. We have an option to purchase an additional 8 new Boeing 767-300 aircraft for delivery in 2025 and 2026 which are not reflected in our purchase commitments.\n\nOur finance lease obligations, including purchase options that are reasonably certain to be exercised, relate primarily to leases on aircraft and real estate. These obligations, together with our obligations under operating leases are set out in note 12 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\n\nUnder provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"), we elected to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries over eight years through 2025. Additionally, we have uncertain tax positions that are further discussed in note 16 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn 2022, we will pay $558 million of employer payroll taxes that we deferred under the CARES Act.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nSee note 6 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for a discussion of pension related matters and note 11 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for a discussion of judicial proceedings and other matters arising from the conduct of our business activities.",

          "chunk_text": "## Estimation of costs at completion for select long-term contracts\n\nAs  discussed  in  Note  B  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  accounting  for  long-term  contracts involves estimation of the costs to complete a contract in order to accurately recognize the associated revenue.  The  estimated  costs  at  completion  for  each  contract  are  used  to  assess  the  proportion  of revenues to recognize based upon the costs incurred-to-date in comparison to the total estimate of costs to complete the contract.\n\nWe identified the assessment of the estimation of costs at completion for a select group of long-term contracts in the defense segments as a critical audit matter. The estimated costs at completion for the select  group  of  long-term  contracts  incorporates  assumptions,  such  as  labor  hours  and  the  cost  of materials for the work to be performed. The evaluation of one or more of the assumptions used in the estimation of the costs to complete for the select group of contracts required a high level of subjective auditor judgment due to the nature of the individual contracts and related contract performance risks. Specifically,  changes  to  certain  assumptions  may  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  estimated  revenue recorded during the period.\n\nThe following are primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the estimation of costs at completion for the select group of long-term contracts. This included contract level controls over the estimated cost assumptions. For certain contracts, we compared the Company's historical estimates of  costs  to  actual  costs  incurred  to  assess  the  Company's  ability  to  estimate  accurately.  Based  on  the nature  of  the  individual  contract,  we  evaluated  certain  assumptions  within  the  Company's  estimated costs at completion by:\n\n- -reading the underlying contract and any related amendments to obtain an understanding of the contractual requirements and related performance obligations\n- -assessing  costs  incurred  to-date  and  the  relative  progress  toward  satisfying  the  performance obligation(s) of the contract\n- -assessing, if relevant, the estimated costs at completion on similar or predecessor contracts and programs\n- -inquiring of financial and operational personnel of the Company to identify factors that should be considered within the estimated costs at completion or indications of potential management bias\n- -inspecting correspondence, if any, between the Company and the customer regarding actual todate and expected performance\n- -analyzing the sufficiency of the Company's assessment of contract performance risks included within the estimated costs at completion.\n\n## Discount rates used in pension benefit obligation\n\nAs  discussed  in  Note  S  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements, t he  Company's  pension  benefit obligation and the associated plan assets were $17.8 billion and $15.2 billion, respectively, on December 31, 2021. These balances resulted in a net liability of $2.6 billion. The pension benefit obligation is the estimated  present  value  of  future  pension  benefits  attributed  to  employee  services  rendered  to  date, including assumptions about future compensation levels.

      "question": "How does GE's uncertainty around margin improvement through operational restructuring contrast with Union Pacific's stated expectation of margin improvement driven by pricing and efficiency initiatives, based on their respective 2022 financial outlooks?",
      "answer": "GE expresses uncertainty regarding margin improvement, citing risks such as the success of operational restructuring, global supply chain disruptions, and the ongoing impact of the pandemic. In contrast, Union Pacific (UNP) explicitly states an expectation of margin improvement in 2022, attributing this to pricing that exceeds inflation and ongoing efficiency initiatives. This contrast highlights differing levels of confidence and strategic clarity between the two companies regarding their ability to enhance margins.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## 2022 Outlook\n\n- Safety - Operating a safe railroad benefits all our constituents: our employees, customers, shareholders, and the communities we serve. We will continue using a multi-faceted approach to safety utilizing technology, risk assessments, training, employee engagement, quality control, and targeted capital investments. As mentioned previously, our initiatives will be informed by recommendations identified in the third-party assessment of the effectiveness of our safety program. Consistent with these recommendations, we will continually evaluate and adjust  deployment  of  Total  Safety  Culture,  Courage  to  Care,  COMMIT,  and  Peer  to  Peer  throughout  our operations, which allows us to identify and implement best practices for employee and operational safety. In addition,  our  Operating  Practices  Command  Center  will  continue  the  implementation  of  our  predictive technology and reduce variability by identifying causes of mainline service interruptions and develop solutions, in  addition  to,  assisting  employees  with  understanding  policies,  procedures,  and  best  practices  for  handling trains. We will continue our efforts to utilize data to identify and mitigate risk, detect rail defects, improve or close crossings, and educate the public and law enforcement agencies about crossing safety through a combination of our own programs (including risk assessment strategies), industry programs, and local community activities across  the  network.  We  also  are  dedicated  to  maintaining  a  healthy  workplace  and  continue  monitoring  the COVID case levels, modifying our policies as needed to protect employees and minimize the risk of workplace transmission.\n- Network Operations - In 2022, we will continue transforming our railroad to increase reliability of our service product, reduce variability in network operations, and improve resource utilization. Further train length initiatives allow us to efficiently add incremental volume growth to our existing train network. We will continue to make capital investments to improve operational performance and efficiency. A more efficient network requires fewer locomotives, freight cars, and other resources.\n- Financial  Expectations -  We  expect  volume  to  outpace  industrial  production  in  2022  as  the  results  of  our business development efforts are bringing new customers to our railroad. In the current environment, we expect continued margin improvement driven by pricing in excess of inflation and ongoing efficiency initiatives, better leveraging  our  resources  and  improving  our  service  product.  We  expect  to  generate  strong  cash  flow  from operating  activities  allowing  us  to  continue  our  industry  leading  dividend  payout  ratio  and  strong  share repurchase  programs.  Economic  uncertainties  remain  in  2022  as  COVID  impacts  linger  and  could  have  a material impact on our 2022 financial and operating results. Regardless of external factors, we will focus on efficiently managing operations; seeking new business opportunities; protecting our employees, customers, and communities; and providing excellent service to our customers.\n- Market Conditions - While current forecasts for industrial production indicate continued economic growth, we expect uncertainties with COVID and the economy to continue in 2022. How governments and consumers react to  the  resurgence,  mutation  of  the  virus,  and  vaccine  mandates  could  result  in  or  contribute  to  customer disruptions, an elongated recovery period, constrained workforce availability, or a general economic downturn from current levels. Disruptions in our customers' supply chains caused by the pandemic or other factors may continue  to  impact  our  shipments.  In  addition,  other  factors  such  as  changes  in  monetary  policy  may  affect economic activity and demand for rail transportation; natural gas prices, weather conditions, and demand for other  energy  sources  may  impact  the  coal  market;  crude  oil  price  spreads  may  drive  demand  for  petroleum products and drilling materials; available truck capacity could impact our intermodal business; and international trade agreements could promote or hinder trade.\n- Fuel Prices -  Projections  for  crude  oil  and  natural  gas  continue  to  fluctuate  in  the  current  environment.  We again could see volatile fuel prices during the year, as they are sensitive to global and U.S. domestic demand, refining capacity, geopolitical events, weather conditions, and other factors. As prices fluctuate, there will be a timing  impact  on  earnings,  as  our  fuel  surcharge  programs  trail  increases  or  decreases  in  fuel  price  by approximately two months.\n- Significant changes in fuel prices could have an impact on consumer discretionary spending, impacting demand for  various  consumer  products  we  transport.  Alternatively,  those  changes  could  have  an  inverse  impact  on commodities such as coal, petroleum products, and domestic drilling-related shipments.\n- Capital Plan - In 2022, we expect our capital plan to be approximately $3.3 billion, up 10% from 2021 as we make investments to support our growth strategy. We will continue to harden our infrastructure, replace older assets, and improve the safety and resilience of the network. In addition, the plan includes targeted freight car acquisitions,  investments  in  growth-related  projects  to  drive  more  carloads  to  the  network,  certain  ramps  to efficiently  handle  volumes  from  new  and  existing  intermodal  customers,  continuous  modernization  of  our locomotive  fleet,  and  projects  intended  to  improve  operational  efficiency.  The  capital  plan  may  be  revised  if business conditions warrant or if new laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments.

      "question": "How did the 6% increase in gross ton-miles at UNP and the strong equipment order growth in GE's Renewable Energy segment influence their respective 2021 operating expenses and profitability, and what role did volume-related cost drivers play in each case?",
      "answer": "The 6% increase in gross ton-miles at UNP directly contributed to a $668 million rise in fuel expenses due to higher locomotive diesel prices and increased transportation activity. This volume-related cost was partially offset by a 1% improvement in fuel efficiency. Meanwhile, GE's Renewable Energy segment experienced strong equipment order growth, particularly in Onshore Wind and Grid Solutions, which contributed to a 13% increase in RPO (Receivables from Performance Obligations), indicating higher future revenue potential. However, GE also faced supply chain challenges that delayed revenue conversion from RPO. Both companies experienced volume-related cost pressures, but GE managed to improve profitability by $0.2 billion (6%) through cost reductions and increased service volume, while UNP saw overall operating expenses rise by $767 million due to a combination of inflation, fuel, and volume-related factors.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From GE's 2021 financials, RPO increased $1.7 billion (13%) due to new service contracts and equipment orders, particularly in Wind and Grid Solutions, indicating strong volume growth.",
        "Step 2: GE faced supply chain challenges converting RPO to revenue, but still achieved a $0.2 billion (6%) profit increase through cost reductions and service volume growth.",

Services revenues increased, driven by a return to pre-pandemic volume in PDx and the continued growth of HCS Service. Equipment revenues decreased driven by reductions in LCS for HCS products where there were more COVID-19 related product sales in 2020 as well as supply chain challenges, partially offset by increased volume in Imaging and Ultrasound.\n\nProfit increased $0.2 billion (6%) organically*, driven by increased volume for Imaging and Ultrasound products, increases in PDx volume as well as continued cost reduction actions, partially offset by continued investment in research and development.\n\nRENEWABLE ENERGY.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOperating expenses increased $767 million in 2021 compared to  2020  driven  by  higher  fuel  prices,  volume-related  costs, inflation,  higher  casualty  costs,  2020  management  actions, weather and wildfire-related expenses, incentive compensation,  and  higher  state  and  local  taxes.  Partially offsetting  these  increases  compared  to  2020  include  a  $278 million  impairment  charge  in  2020,  productivity  initiatives,  a one-time  bonus  payment  for  agreement  employees  in  2020, and lower severance costs. Full year results of 2021 and 2020 both include a reduction of expense for weather and wildfirerelated insurance reimbursements, $6 million and $25 million, respectively.\n\n2021 Operating Expenses\n\nCompensation and Benefits -  Compensation and benefits include wages, payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension  costs,  and  incentive  costs.  In  2021,  expenses  increased  4%  compared  to  2020,  due  to  volume  related costs,  inflation,  2020  management  actions  responding  to  the  sharp  decline  in  volume  (temporary  unpaid  leave, salary reductions, and shop closures), incentive compensation, and higher costs due to weather and wildfire-related events. Partially offsetting these increases were productivity initiatives resulting in employee levels that declined 3% compared to 2020 despite a 4% volume increase, a 2020 one-time bonus payment for agreement employees who worked during the pandemic, and lower severance costs.\n\nDepreciation -  The  majority  of  depreciation  relates  to  road  property,  including  rail,  ties,  ballast,  and  other  track material. Depreciation expense was flat in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\nFuel -  Fuel  includes  locomotive  fuel  and  gasoline  for  highway  and  non-highway  vehicles  and  heavy  equipment. Locomotive diesel fuel prices, which averaged $2.23 per gallon (including taxes and transportation costs) in 2021, compared  to  $1.50  per  gallon  in  2020,  increased  expenses  $668  million  (excluding  any  impact  from  increased volume year-over-year). Gross ton-miles increased 6% driving higher fuel expense. Partially offsetting this increase was a 1% improvement to a record low fuel consumption rate, computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross ton-miles.\n\nPurchased Services and Materials - Expense for purchased services and materials includes the costs of services purchased  from  outside  contractors  and  other  service  providers  (including  equipment  maintenance  and  contract expenses incurred by our subsidiaries for external transportation services); materials used to maintain the Railroad's lines, structures, and  equipment;  costs  of  operating  facilities jointly  used  by  UPRR  and  other  railroads; transportation and lodging for train crew employees; trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers; leased automobile  maintenance  expenses;  and  tools  and  supplies.  Purchased  services  and  materials  increased  3%  in 2021 compared to 2020 driven by inflation, higher professional services expense, volume-related costs associated with  our  intermodal  business,  higher  costs  due  to  weather  and  wildfire-related  events,  increased  locomotive  and freight car maintenance expense as we added resources to the network, and higher costs for transportation of train crews.\n\nEquipment  and  Other  Rents -  Equipment  and  other  rents  expense  primarily  includes  rental  expense  that  the Railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies; freight car, intermodal, and locomotive leases;  and  office  and  other  rent  expenses,  offset  by  equity  income  from  certain  equity  method  investments. Equipment and other rents expense decreased 2% compared to 2020 driven by lower rent on equipment in storage and  higher  equity  income  from  our  investment  in  TTX  Company,  partially  offset  by  increased  freight  car  rent expense due to volume increases and slower freight car velocity.\n\nOther - Other expenses include state and local taxes, freight, equipment and property damage, utilities, insurance, personal  injury,  environmental,  employee  travel,  telephone  and  cellular,  computer  software,  bad  debt,  and  other general expenses. Other expenses decreased 13% in 2021 compared to 2020 as a result of a $278 million noncash impairment charge related to our Brazos yard investment in 2020, lower write-offs of cancelled in-progress capital  projects,  2020  lease  impairments,  and  higher  equity  income.  Partially  offsetting  these  decreases  were increased casualty expenses, including personal injury, damaged freight, and environmental, and higher state and local  taxes.  Both  periods  in  2021  and  2020  included  a  reduction  of  expense  for  weather  and  wildfire-related insurance reimbursements, $6 million and $25 million, respectively.\n\n## Non-Operating Items\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nWe are continually evaluating our financial condition and liquidity. We analyze a wide range of economic scenarios and the  impact  on  our  ability  to  generate  cash.  These  analyses  inform  our  liquidity  plans  and  activities  outlined below and indicate we have sufficient borrowing capacity to sustain an extended period of lower volumes.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, we had a working capital deficit due to upcoming debt maturities. At December 31, 2020, we had a surplus due to an increased cash balance held due to the uncertainty related to COVID. It is not unusual for us to have a working capital deficit, and we believe it is not an indication of a lack of liquidity. We also maintain adequate  resources,  including  our  credit  facility  and,  when  necessary,  access  the  capital  markets  to  meet  any foreseeable cash requirements.\n\nDuring the year, we generated $9.0 billion of cash from operating activities, completed a $1.7 billion debt exchange, and issued $3.5 billion of long-term debt. We have been, and we expect to continue to be, in compliance with our debt  covenants.  We  increased  the  dividend  twice  during  2021  paying  out  $2.8  billion  and  repurchased  shares totaling $7.3 billion, including the completion of our $2 billion accelerated share repurchase programs entered into on May 25, 2021.\n\nOur principal sources of liquidity include cash, cash equivalents, our Receivables Facility, our revolving credit facility, as  well  as  the  availability  of  commercial  paper  and  other  sources  of  financing  through  the  capital  markets.  On December 31, 2021, we had $960 million of cash and cash equivalents, $2.0 billion of committed credit available under our revolving credit facility, and up to $500 million undrawn on the Receivables Facility. As of December 31, 2021, none of the revolving credit facility was drawn, and we did not draw on our revolving credit facility at any time during  2021.  At  December  31,  2021,  we  had  $300  million  of  the  Receivables  Facility  drawn,  $400  million  of commercial  paper,  and  a  $100  million  term  loan  outstanding.  Our  access  to  the  Receivables  Facility  may  be reduced or restricted if our bond ratings fall to certain levels below investment grade. If our bond rating were to deteriorate, it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity. Access to commercial paper as well as other capital market financing is dependent on market conditions. Deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to access capital markets as a source of liquidity. Access to liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability. We expect that we will continue to have access to liquidity through any or all the following sources or activities: (i) increasing the utilization of our Receivables Facility, (ii) issuing commercial paper, (iii) entering into bank loans, outside of our revolving credit facility, or (iv) issuing bonds or other debt securities to public or private investors based on our assessment of the current condition of the credit markets. The Company's $2.0 billion revolving credit facility is intended to support the issuance of commercial paper by UPC and also serves as an additional source of liquidity to fund short-term needs. The Company currently does not intend to make any borrowings under this facility.\n\nAs described in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and as referenced in the table below, we have contractual obligations that may affect our financial condition. Based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations, other than the risks that we and other similarly situated companies face with respect to the condition of the capital markets (as described in Item 1A of Part II of this report), there is no known  trend,  demand,  commitment,  event,  or  uncertainty  that  is  reasonably  likely  to  occur  that  would  have  a material  adverse  effect  on  our  consolidated  results  of  operations,  financial  condition,  or  liquidity.  In  addition,  our commercial  obligations,  financings,  and  commitments  are  customary  transactions  that  are  like  those  of  other comparable corporations, particularly within the transportation industry.\n\nThe following table identifies material obligations as of December 31, 2021:\n\n",

Progress collections and current deferred income included early payments received at our Aviation Military equipment business of $0.7 billion in 2020 as part of the U.S. Department of Defense's efforts to support vendors in its supply chain during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCash from investing activities was $19.3 billion in 2020, an increase of $7.1 billion compared with 2019, primarily due to: net proceeds from the sale of our BioPharma business in 2020 of $20.5 billion; partially offset by the nonrecurrence of proceeds from the spin-off of our Transportation business of $6.2 billion (including the sale of our retained ownership interests in Wabtec); lower proceeds from sales of our stake in Baker Hughes of $2.6 billion (including the sale of a portion of our retained ownership interests in 2020); higher net purchases of equity investments of $1.5 billion and lower cash received related to net settlements between our continuing operations and businesses in discontinued operations of $1.5 billion (both components of All other investing activities); and lower other business dispositions of $1.1 billion. Cash used for additions to property, plant and equipment and internal-use software, which are components of free cash flows*, was $1.7 billion in 2020, down $0.8 billion compared with 2019.\n\nCash used for financing activities was $19.8 billion in 2020, an increase of $4.1 billion compared with 2019, primarily due to: higher payments for debt extinguishments of $11.4 billion; a reduction in commercial paper of $3.0 billion; partially offset by an increase in other net debt issuances of $9.4 billion and lower cash settlements of $1.1 billion on derivatives hedging foreign currency debt. We paid cash to repurchase long term debt of $16.5 billion and $5.1 billion, including cash paid for debt extinguishment costs of $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nCASH FLOWS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. Cash from operating activities in 2021 related primarily to cash generated from earnings (loss) from discontinued operations in our GECAS business. Cash used for investing activities decreased in 2021 compared with 2020, primarily due to an increase in net purchases of plant, property and equipment partially offset by an increase in net collections of financing receivables.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nWe are continually evaluating our financial condition and liquidity. We analyze a wide range of economic scenarios and the  impact  on  our  ability  to  generate  cash.  These  analyses  inform  our  liquidity  plans  and  activities  outlined below and indicate we have sufficient borrowing capacity to sustain an extended period of lower volumes.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, we had a working capital deficit due to upcoming debt maturities. At December 31, 2020, we had a surplus due to an increased cash balance held due to the uncertainty related to COVID. It is not unusual for us to have a working capital deficit, and we believe it is not an indication of a lack of liquidity. We also maintain adequate  resources,  including  our  credit  facility  and,  when  necessary,  access  the  capital  markets  to  meet  any foreseeable cash requirements.\n\nDuring the year, we generated $9.0 billion of cash from operating activities, completed a $1.7 billion debt exchange, and issued $3.5 billion of long-term debt. We have been, and we expect to continue to be, in compliance with our debt  covenants.  We  increased  the  dividend  twice  during  2021  paying  out  $2.8  billion  and  repurchased  shares totaling $7.3 billion, including the completion of our $2 billion accelerated share repurchase programs entered into on May 25, 2021.\n\nOur principal sources of liquidity include cash, cash equivalents, our Receivables Facility, our revolving credit facility, as  well  as  the  availability  of  commercial  paper  and  other  sources  of  financing  through  the  capital  markets.  On December 31, 2021, we had $960 million of cash and cash equivalents, $2.0 billion of committed credit available under our revolving credit facility, and up to $500 million undrawn on the Receivables Facility. As of December 31, 2021, none of the revolving credit facility was drawn, and we did not draw on our revolving credit facility at any time during  2021.  At  December  31,  2021,  we  had  $300  million  of  the  Receivables  Facility  drawn,  $400  million  of commercial  paper,  and  a  $100  million  term  loan  outstanding.  Our  access  to  the  Receivables  Facility  may  be reduced or restricted if our bond ratings fall to certain levels below investment grade. If our bond rating were to deteriorate, it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity. Access to commercial paper as well as other capital market financing is dependent on market conditions. Deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to access capital markets as a source of liquidity. Access to liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability. We expect that we will continue to have access to liquidity through any or all the following sources or activities: (i) increasing the utilization of our Receivables Facility, (ii) issuing commercial paper, (iii) entering into bank loans, outside of our revolving credit facility, or (iv) issuing bonds or other debt securities to public or private investors based on our assessment of the current condition of the credit markets. The Company's $2.0 billion revolving credit facility is intended to support the issuance of commercial paper by UPC and also serves as an additional source of liquidity to fund short-term needs. The Company currently does not intend to make any borrowings under this facility.\n\nAs described in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and as referenced in the table below, we have contractual obligations that may affect our financial condition. Based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations, other than the risks that we and other similarly situated companies face with respect to the condition of the capital markets (as described in Item 1A of Part II of this report), there is no known  trend,  demand,  commitment,  event,  or  uncertainty  that  is  reasonably  likely  to  occur  that  would  have  a material  adverse  effect  on  our  consolidated  results  of  operations,  financial  condition,  or  liquidity.  In  addition,  our commercial  obligations,  financings,  and  commitments  are  customary  transactions  that  are  like  those  of  other comparable corporations, particularly within the transportation industry.\n\nThe following table identifies material obligations as of December 31, 2021:\n\n",

      "answer": "The combined effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents for Honeywell and RTX in 2023 is $32 million ($14 million for Honeywell and $18 million for RTX). Honeywell experienced a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $1,702 million, while RTX saw a net increase of $335 million. Therefore, the foreign exchange impact represents a small fraction of their overall cash flow changes, with a larger influence seen in Honeywell\u2019s cash reduction and RTX\u2019s cash growth.",

      "answer": "Honeywell (HON) expects raw material prices to moderate and has implemented mitigation strategies such as formula-driven or long-term supply agreements, price increases, and hedging activities to offset cost increases. As a result, HON does not anticipate any material adverse impacts from raw material shortages in 2024. In contrast, Raytheon Technologies (RTX) has experienced increased supply costs due to inflation, geopolitical tensions, and reliance on foreign suppliers for materials like cobalt, tantalum, and titanium. RTX expects continued negative impacts into 2024, including prolonged delays for critical components and increased operating costs, which will affect its results of operations and liquidity.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, HON expects raw material prices to moderate and uses supply agreements, price increases, and hedging to offset cost increases, and does not anticipate material adverse impacts in 2024.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, RTX has seen increased costs due to inflation, geopolitical conditions, and reliance on foreign single-source suppliers (e.g., cobalt, tantalum), and expects continued supply chain disruptions and cost pressures into 2024.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize that while both companies face raw material price increases, HON\u2019s proactive mitigation strategies lead to a more optimistic outlook, whereas RTX\u2019s exposure to geopolitical and supplier risks results in a more negative expectation for 2024."

      "answer": "In 2024, GD spent $1,501 million and UPS spent $500 million on Purchases of Common Stock, totaling $2,001 million. GD's cash flow from operating activities was $4,112 million, meaning stock repurchases consumed 36.5% of its operating cash flow. UPS's cash flow from operating activities was $10,122 million, so its stock repurchases represented 4.9% of its operating cash flow. Therefore, GD allocated a significantly higher proportion of its operating cash to stock repurchases compared to UPS.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - GD spent $1,501 million on Purchases of Common Stock in 2024.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - UPS spent $500 million on Purchases of Common Stock in 2024.",
        "Step 3: Calculate total stock repurchases: $1,501M (GD) + $500M (UPS) = $2,001M.",
        "Step 4: Extract from source A - GD's 2024 cash flow from operating activities was $4,112 million.",
        "Step 5: Extract from source B - UPS's 2024 cash flow from operating activities was $10,122 million.",
        "Step 6: Calculate percentage of operating cash used for stock repurchases: GD = $1,501M / $4,112M = 36.5%; UPS = $500M / $10,122M = 4.9%.",
        "Step 7: Synthesize - Both companies spent on stock repurchases, but GD used a much higher proportion of its operating cash for this purpose compared to UPS."

In contrast, UPS's Roadie reporting unit had a limited cushion above its carrying value as of the July 1, 2024 testing date, though the exact percentage was not disclosed. This indicates that General Dynamics' Technologies reporting unit had a quantifiably stronger financial risk buffer compared to UPS's Roadie unit, which faces a higher relative risk of potential impairment if performance forecasts are not met or cost of capital increases.",

We consider securities with a m aturity of three m onths or less to be cash equivalents. Our cash balances are invested prim arily in tim e deposits rated A-/A3 or higher. Our investm ents in other securities are included in other current and noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. W e report our equity securities at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value  recognized  in  net  earnings.  W e  report  our  available-for-sale  debt  securities  at  fair  value  with  unrealized  gains  and  losses  recognized  as  a component of other comprehensive (loss) incom e in the Consolidated Statem ent of Com prehensive Incom e.  W e had no m aterial trading or held-tomaturity  debt  securities  on  Decem ber  31,  2024  or  2023.  See  Note  P  for  additional  inform ation  regarding  our  investm ents  in  debt  and  equity securities.\n\nAcquisitions. In the last three years, we acquired a business in our Aerospace segm ent, a business in our Com bat System s segm ent and  two businesses in our T echnologies segm ent. The operating results of these acquisitions have been included in our reported results since their respective closing dates. The purchase prices of the acquisitions have been allocated to the estim ated fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill.\n\nLong-lived Assets and  Goodwill. We review long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to am ortization, for im pairm ent whenever events or changes in circum stances indicate that the carrying value of the assets m ay not be recoverable. W e assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of undiscounted projected cash flows. Im pairm ent losses, where identified, are m easured as the excess of the carrying value of the long-lived assets over the estim ated fair value as determ ined by discounted cash flows.\n\nGoodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business com bination. We review goodwill for im pairm ent annually at each of our reporting units or when circum stances indicate that the likelihood of an im pairm ent is greater than 50%. Our reporting units are consistent with our operating segm ents in Note O. W e use both qualitative and quantitative approaches when testing goodwill for im pairm ent. When determ ining the approach to be used, we consider the current facts and circum stances of each reporting unit as well as the excess of each reporting unit's estim ated fair value over its carrying value based on our m ost recent quantitative assessm ents. Our qualitative approach evaluates the business environm ent and various events im pacting the reporting unit including, but not lim ited to, m acroeconom ic conditions, changes in the business environm ent and reporting unit-specific events. If, based on the qualitative assessm ent, we determ ine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value, then a quantitative assessm ent is not necessary . However, if a quantitative assessm ent is determ ined to be necessary , we com pare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value and, if necessary , recognize an impairment loss for the am ount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. Our estim ate of a reporting unit's fair value is based primarily on the discounted cash flows of the underlying operations.\n\nIn  the  f ourth  quarter  of  2024,  we  com pleted  qualitative  assessm ents  for  each  of  our  reporting  units.  Our Aerospace,  Marine  System s  and Combat Systems reporting units' estim ated fair values significantly exceeded their respective carrying values based on our m ost recent quantitative assessments, which were perform ed in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our T echnologies reporting unit's estim ated fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 25% at the tim e of our last quantitative assessm ent in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our qualitative assessm ents this year did not present indicators of im pairm ent.\n\nFor a summary of our goodwill by reporting unit, see Note H.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n- or more of our reporting units. The projections that we use in our DCF model are updated annually, or more often if necessary, and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units.\n- The market approach uses observable market data of comparable public companies to estimate fair value utilizing financial metrics (such as enterprise value to net sales). We apply judgment to select appropriate comparison companies based on the business operations, size and operating results of our reporting units. Changes to our selection of comparable companies or market multiples may result in changes to the estimates of fair value of our reporting units.\n\nIn 2024, we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing using both qualitative and quantitative methods. As of our July 1 testing date, we concluded the fair value of each reporting unit ex ceeded its carrying value; however, three reporting units (Roadie, G lobal Freight Forwarding, and Global Logistics and Distribution) exhibited limited ex cess of fair value and thus reflect a greater risk of impairment occurring in future periods. Approx imately $1.1 billion of our consolidated goodwill balance of $4.3 billion is represented by these three reporting units.\n\nIn addition to forecasted and actual business performance, our valuation estimates are most sensitive to changes in cost of capital. For the reporting units we have identified as having limited cushion above, if the cost of capital were increased by 100 basis points or our projected cash flows were reduced by 10 percent, it is reasonably possible that these reporting units would be impaired. We believe the fair values of our Roadie, Global Freight Forwarding, and Global Logistics and Distribution reporting units continue to exceed their respective carrying values. However, if the businesses do not meet forecasts or cost of capital requirements increase, we may incur future impairment charges. We continue to monitor all of our reporting units between annual testing dates.\n\nWe did not record any goodwill impairments during 2024. During 2023, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $56 million related to Roadie and $61 million related to Delivery Solutions. The Delivery Solutions impairment represented all of the goodwill associated with this reporting unit. These charges are included within Other expenses in the statement of consolidated income. We did not incur any goodwill impairment charges in 2022.\n\nOur finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. These assets are tested for impairment as part of asset groups that may include other long-lived assets. See \"Critical Accounting Estimates - Depreciation, Residual Value and Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment\" for a discussion of estimates impacting asset groups. In addition, a reduction in expected useful life, or a decision to sell or abandon an intangible asset before the end of its useful life, may increase amortization expense, which could have a material impact on our results of operations. As a result of our strategic actions under our Efficiency Reimagined initiatives, we are reviewing our software application infrastructure and ex pect that as result of this review, it is reasonably possible that revisions to the useful lives of certain finite-lived intangible assets will occur in future periods. See note 7 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for a discussion of finitelived intangible asset impairments.\n\n## Self-Insurance Accruals\n\nWe base self-insurance reserves on actuarial estimates, which are determined with the assistance of a third-party actuary through a complex process that includes the application of various actuarial methods and assumptions. The process incorporates actual loss experience and judgments about expected future development based on historical experience, recent and projected trends in claim frequency and severity, changes in the level of risk retained under our programs and changes in claims handling practices, among other factors.\n\nWorkers' compensation, automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take a number of years to resolve. Consequently, actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to resolve a claim. Several factors can affect the actual cost, or severity, of a claim, including:\n\n- Risk retention limits;\n- Length of time a claim remains open;\n- Trends in healthcare and litigation costs;\n- Results of any related litigation; and\n- Changes in legislation.",
