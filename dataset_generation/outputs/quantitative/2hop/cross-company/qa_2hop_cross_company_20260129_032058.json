      "question": "What is the combined total of Medicare Rebates for ABBV and PFE in 2023, and how does the difference between their respective balances and payments for Medicare Rebates in that year reflect their financial obligations and cash outflows related to this liability?",
      "answer": "The combined total of Medicare Rebates for ABBV and PFE in 2023 is $6,294 million. ABBV had a Medicare Rebates balance of $5,297 million and payments of $15,054 million in 2023, indicating a significant cash outflow relative to its liability. PFE had Medicare Rebates of $997 million in 2023, which was its incurred liability for that year with no separate payment amount specified. This shows ABBV had a larger financial obligation and cash outflow related to Medicare Rebates compared to PFE in 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - ABBV's Medicare Rebates balance for 2023 is $5,297 million and payments made in 2023 are $15,054 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - PFE's Medicare Rebates liability for 2023 is $997 million.",
        "Step 3: Calculate combined total - $5,297 million (ABBV) + $997 million (PFE) = $6,294 million.",
        "Step 4: Analyze financial obligations and cash outflows - ABBV's payments significantly exceed its balance, indicating a larger cash outflow tied to its Medicare Rebates liability, while PFE only reports the liability with no specific payment amount."

      "answer": "AbbVie is advancing its oncology portfolio through the commercial execution of Venclexta, Epkinly, and Elahere, which supports its strategic objective of maintaining growth and competitiveness in the oncology space, especially in the face of challenges with Imbruvica. Meanwhile, Pfizer significantly bolstered its oncology capabilities through the December 2023 acquisition of Seagen, gaining four in-line medicines\u2014Padcev, Adcetris, Tukysa, and Tivdak\u2014alongside a robust pipeline. This acquisition allows Pfizer to span multiple modalities, including ADCs, small molecules, bispecifics, and other immunotherapies, thereby enhancing its competitive positioning. Together, both companies are strategically strengthening their oncology portfolios, but Pfizer\u2019s acquisition represents a more transformative step in reshaping its presence in the oncology market.",

          "chunk_text": "## 2025 Strategic Objectives\n\nAbbVie's mission is to discover and develop innovative medicines and products that solve serious health issues today and address the medical challenges of tomorrow while achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding execution. AbbVie intends to execute its strategy and advance its mission in a number of ways, including: (i) maximizing the benefits of a diversified revenue base with multiple long-term growth drivers; (ii) leveraging AbbVie's commercial strength and international infrastructure across therapeutic areas and ensuring strong commercial execution of new product launches; (iii) continuing to invest in and expand its pipeline in support of opportunities in immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care as well as continued investment in key onmarket products; (iv) generating substantial operating cash flows to support investment in innovative research and development, and return cash to shareholders via a strong and growing dividend while also continuing to repay debt. In addition, AbbVie anticipates several regulatory submissions and data readouts from key clinical trials in the next 12 months.\n\nAbbVie expects to achieve its strategic objectives through:\n\n- Maximizing revenue growth of our key on-market products, including Skyrizi, Rinvoq, Venclexta, Elahere, Vraylar, Ubrelvy, Qulipta, Vyalev/Produodopa, Botox and Juvederm Collection.\n- Advancing our research and development pipeline by delivering late-stage pipeline milestones, achieving key proof-of-concept objectives across therapeutic areas and continuing to invest in key on-market product indication expansion.\n- Maximizing the value of key acquisitions as well as continuing to invest in external innovation.\n- Continuing to effectively manage the impact of Humira biosimilar erosion.\n- The favorable impact of pipeline products and indications recently approved or currently under regulatory review where approval is expected in 2025. These products are described in greater detail in the section labeled \"Research and Development\" included as part of this Item 7.\n\n## 2024 Financial Results\n\nAbbVie's strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, maximizing the benefits of a diversified revenue base, advancing and investing in its pipeline and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. The company's financial performance in 2024 included delivering worldwide net revenues of $56.3 billion, operating earnings of $9.1 billion, diluted earnings per share of $2.39 and cash flows from operations of $18.8 billion. Worldwide net revenues increased by 4% on a reported and 5% on a constant currency basis.\n\nDiluted earnings per share in 2024 was $2.39 and included the following after-tax costs: (i) $6.5 billion related to the amortization of intangible assets; (ii) $3.7 billion for the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; (iii) $3.5 billion related to intangible asset impairment; (iv) $978 million of acquisition and integration expenses; and (v) $721 million for charges related to litigation matters. These costs were partially offset by an income tax benefit of $1.8 billion primarily related to the settlement of income tax examinations. Additionally, financial results reflected continued funding to support all stages of AbbVie's pipeline assets and continued investment in AbbVie's on-market brands.\n\n## Regulation\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 has and will continue to have a significant impact on how drugs are covered and paid for under the Medicare program, i ncluding through the creation of financial penalties for drugs whose price increases outpace inflation, the redesign of Medicare Part D benefits to shift a greater portion of the costs to manufacturers, and through government price-setting for certain Medicare Part B and Part D drugs. In 2023, Imbruvica was selected as one of the first 10 medicines subject to government-set prices beginning in 2026. In 2024, the CMS published Medicare Part D prices that will be applicable to the 10 selected drugs, including Imbruvica, beginning in 2026. In January 2025, HHS, through the CMS, selected Vraylar and Linzess as two of the 15 medicines subject to government-set prices beginning in 2027. It is possible that more of our products, including products that generate substantial revenues, could be selected in future years, which could, among other things, accelerate revenue erosion prior to expiration of intellectual property protections. The effect of reducing prices and reimbursement for certain of our products would significantly impact our results of operations. See Part I, Item 1 'Business - Regulation - Commercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing,' Part I, Item 1A 'Risk Factors' and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\n2024 Form 10-K |",

These items are adjusted after considering their quantitative and qualitative aspects and typically have one or more of the following characteristics, such as being highly variable, difficult to project, unusual in nature, significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of past or future operating results. These items are excluded from non-GAAP earnings and related EPS information because the Company believes they neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company's business nor reflect the Company's underlying business performance. Similar charges or gains were recognized in prior periods and will likely reoccur in future periods, including (i) amortization of acquired intangible assets, including product rights that generate a significant portion of our ongoing revenue and will recur until the intangible assets are fully amortized, (ii) unwinding of inventory purchase price adjustments, (iii) acquisition and integration expenses, (iv) restructuring costs, (v) accelerated depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, (vi) costs of acquiring a priority review voucher, (vii) divestiture gains or losses, (viii) stock compensation resulting from acquisition-related equity awards, (ix ) pension, legal and other contractual settlement charges, (x) equity investment and contingent value rights fair value adjustments (including fair value adjustments attributed to limited partnership equity method investments), (xi) income resulting from the change in control of the Nimbus TYK2 Program and (xii) amortization of fair value adjustments of debt acquired from Celgene in our 2019 exchange offer, among other items. Deferred and current income taxes attributed to these items are also adjusted for considering their individual impact to the overall tax  ex pense, deductibility and jurisdictional tax  rates. Certain other significant tax  items are also ex cluded such as the impact resulting from a non-U.S. tax ruling regarding the deductibility of a statutory impairment of subsidiary investments and release of income tax reserves relating to the Celgene acquisition. We also provide international revenues for our priority products excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We calculate foreign exchange impacts by converting our current-period local currency financial results using the prior period average currency rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our current-period results. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in Exhibit 99.1 to our Form 8-K filed on February 6, 2025 and are incorporated herein by reference.\n\nNon-GAAP information is  intended  to  portray  the  results  of  our  baseline  performance,  supplement  or  enhance  management's,  analysts'  and  investors'  overall understanding of our underlying financial performance and facilitate comparisons among current, past and future periods. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be the same as or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items being adjusted. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.",

          "chunk_text": "fl ows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an i ndividual asset, the review is applied at the lowest level for which cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.\n\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not amortized but are subject to an impairment review annually and more frequently when indicators of i mpairment exist. An impairment of goodwill could occur if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit. An impairment of i ndefinite-lived intangible assets would occur if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value.\n\nThe company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. For its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease projected cash flows and the estimated fair value of the related intangible assets. Future changes to these estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on the company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the company's estimates.\n\n## Foreign Currency Translation\n\nForeign subsidiary earnings are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates. The net assets of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The net assets of subsidiaries in highly inflationary economies are remeasured as if the functional currency were the reporting currency. The remeasurement is recognized in net foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of earnings.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nAll derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets and are classified as current or l ong-term based on the scheduled maturity of the instrument.\n\nFor derivatives formally designated as hedges, the company assesses at inception and quarterly thereafter whether the hedging derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. The changes in fair value of a derivative designated as a fair value hedge and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings immediately. The effective portions of changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge are reported in AOCI and are subsequently recognized in earnings consistent with the underlying hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative is no longer highly effective as a hedge, the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. If a hedged forecasted transaction becomes probable of not occurring, any gains or losses are reclassified from AOCI to earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value through current earnings.\n\nThe company also uses derivative instruments or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these hedges are included in AOCI.\n\nDerivative cash flows, with the exception of net investment hedges, are principally classified in the operating section of the consolidated statements of cash fl ows, consistent with the underlying hedged item. Cash flows related to net investment hedges are classified in the investing section of the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n2024 Form 10-K\n\n",

Estimating the impact of restructuring plans, including future termination benefits, integration expenses and other exit costs, requires judgment. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Restructuring charges are recognized upon meeting certain criteria, including finalization of committed plans, reliable estimates and discussions with local works councils in certain markets.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nLoss  contingencies  from  legal  proceedings  and  claims  may  occur  from  government  investigations,  shareholder  lawsuits,  product  and  environmental  liability, contractual claims, tax and other matters. Accruals are recognized when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Gain contingencies (including contingent proceeds related to the divestitures) are not recognized until realized. Legal fees are ex pensed as incurred.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRefer to '-Note 2. Revenue' for a detailed discussion of accounting policies related to revenue recognition, including deferred revenue and royalties. Refer to 'Note 3. Alliances' for further details regarding alliances.\n\n## Research and Development and Acquired IPRD\n\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical study and certain research costs are recognized over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjusted as necessary based upon an ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred. Research and development costs are presented net of reimbursements from alliance partners.\n\nAcquired IPRD expenses include upfront payments, contingent milestone payments in connection with asset acquisitions or in-license arrangements of third-party intellectual property rights, as well as any upfront and contingent milestones payable by BMS to alliance partners prior to regulatory approval.\n\nThe Company's Acquired IPRD by type of transaction was as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "DHR explicitly stated that the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies in 2023 negatively impacted its operating profits when translating foreign operations into U.S. dollars, with particular exposure due to higher European sales than expenses. In contrast, GILD used estimates of future operating profits as a key input in valuing intangible assets, including assumptions about revenues, market share, and currency-neutral financial performance.

      "answer": "DHR's net deferred tax liability increased by $766 million from 2022 ($-2,958 million) to 2023 ($-2,192 million), indicating a reduction in the company's deferred tax burden. In contrast, GILD's deferred tax liability is influenced by the acquisition of MYR, where the net deferred tax liability was based on differences between financial statement and tax basis of acquired assets, including the $845 million finite-lived intangible asset for Hepcludex (amortized over 10 years) and $1.19 billion acquired IPR&D. These assets contribute to GILD's deferred tax position, but the tax treatment of goodwill ($226 million) is not deductible, which affects long-term tax liabilities differently than DHR's trend suggests.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - DHR's net deferred tax liability was $-2,958 million in 2022 and $-2,192 million in 2023, showing a $766 million increase.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - GILD's deferred tax liability is based on differences between financial and tax basis of acquired assets, including a $845 million finite-lived intangible asset and $1.19 billion in acquired IPR&D from the MYR acquisition.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b - GILD's goodwill of $226 million is not tax-deductible, which affects how deferred tax liabilities are calculated and evolve over time.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - DHR shows a reduction in net deferred tax liability (i.e., an improvement), while GILD's position is shaped by acquisition-related deferred tax implications, particularly from intangible assets and non-deductible goodwill."

Amgen\u2019s positive other income contributes favorably to its consolidated net income, while Thermo Fisher\u2019s negative other income slightly reduces its consolidated income before taxes, thereby having opposite effects on their pre-tax financial positions.",

      "answer": "The combined global revenue from Immunology products for JNJ and LLY in 2021 was $18.68 billion. JNJ\u2019s Immunology products achieved $16.8 billion in sales in 2021, representing an 11.3% increase compared to the prior year.

          "chunk_text": "Immunology products achieved sales of $16.8 billion in 2021, representing an increase of 11.3% as compared to the prior year driven by strong uptake of STELARA (ustekinumab) in Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis and strength in TREMFYA (guselkumab) in Psoriasis and uptake in Psoriatic Arthritis. This was partially offset by lower sales of REMICADE (infliximab) due to biosimilar competition. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\nBiosimilar versions of REMICADE have been introduced in the United States and certain markets outside the United States and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition will result in a further reduction in sales of REMICADE . \u00ae \u00ae\n\nThe latest expiring United States patent for STELARA (ustekinumab) will expire in September 2023. STELARA (ustekinumab) U.S. sales in fiscal 2021 were approximately $5.9 billion. The expiration of a product patent or loss of market exclusivity is likely to result in a reduction in sales. \u00ae \u00ae\n\nInfectious disease products achieved sales of $5.9 billion in 2021, representing an increase of 64.0% as compared to the prior year. Growth was primarily driven by the contribution of the COVID-19 vaccine. This was partially offset by lower sales of PREZISTA and PREZCOBIX /REZOLSTA  (darunavir/cobicistat) due to increased competition and loss of exclusivity of PREZISTA in certain countries outside the U.S. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\nNeuroscience products achieved sales of $7.0 billion, representing an increase of 7.1% as compared to the prior year. Paliperidone long-acting injectables growth was driven by sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA /XEPLION  (paliperidone palmitate) and INVEGA TRINZA /TREVICTA  from new patient starts and persistence as well as the launch of INVEGA HAFYERA\u2122. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\nOncology products achieved sales of $14.5 billion in 2021, representing an increase of 17.6% as compared to the prior year. Contributors to the growth were strong sales of DARZALEX (daratumumab) driven by continued strong market growth, share gains in all regions and solid uptake of the subcutaneous formulation launched in 2020; the continued global launch uptake of ERLEADA  (apalutamide) and IMBRUVICA  (ibrutinib) growth primarily driven by market and continued share leadership. The growth of IMBRUVICA  (ibrutinib) was partially offset by competitive pressures from novel oral agents and COVID-19 related market dynamics including delays in new patient starts. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\nPulmonary Hypertension products achieved sales of $3.5 billion, representing an increase of 9.6% as compared to the prior year. Sales growth of OPSUMIT (macitentan) and UPTRAVI (selexipag) were due to continued share gains and market growth. \u00ae \u00ae\n\nCardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $4.5 billion, a decline of 8.6% as compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily attributable to lower sales of INVOKANA /INVOKAMET  (canagliflozin) due to share erosion and PROCRIT / EPREX (epoetin alfa) due to biosimilar competition. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae",

JNJ's oncology revenue was $14.5 billion in 2021, showing a 17.6% increase compared to the prior year, driven by strong sales of DARZALEX, ERLEADA, and IMBRUVICA. LLY's oncology revenue was $3.0288 billion in 2021, showing a smaller growth rate of approximately 8.5% compared to the prior year (calculated from $2.7921 billion in 2020). JNJ experienced stronger growth due to market expansion and new formulations, while LLY's growth was more moderate, with Alimta declining and Verzenio showing strong growth.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - JNJ's oncology revenue in 2021 was $14.5 billion, representing a 17.6% increase compared to the prior year.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - LLY's oncology revenue in 2021 was $3.0288 billion, up from $2.7921 billion in 2020, representing approximately 8.5% growth.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Combine both oncology revenues to calculate the total global oncology revenue ($14.5 billion + $3.0288 billion = $17.5288 billion). Contrast the growth dynamics: JNJ experienced significantly stronger growth due to market share gains and new product formulations, while LLY had more modest growth with mixed performance across its oncology portfolio."

          "chunk_text": "Immunology products achieved sales of $16.8 billion in 2021, representing an increase of 11.3% as compared to the prior year driven by strong uptake of STELARA (ustekinumab) in Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis and strength in TREMFYA (guselkumab) in Psoriasis and uptake in Psoriatic Arthritis. This was partially offset by lower sales of REMICADE (infliximab) due to biosimilar competition. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\nBiosimilar versions of REMICADE have been introduced in the United States and certain markets outside the United States and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition will result in a further reduction in sales of REMICADE . \u00ae \u00ae\n\nThe latest expiring United States patent for STELARA (ustekinumab) will expire in September 2023. STELARA (ustekinumab) U.S. sales in fiscal 2021 were approximately $5.9 billion. The expiration of a product patent or loss of market exclusivity is likely to result in a reduction in sales. \u00ae \u00ae\n\nInfectious disease products achieved sales of $5.9 billion in 2021, representing an increase of 64.0% as compared to the prior year. Growth was primarily driven by the contribution of the COVID-19 vaccine. This was partially offset by lower sales of PREZISTA and PREZCOBIX /REZOLSTA  (darunavir/cobicistat) due to increased competition and loss of exclusivity of PREZISTA in certain countries outside the U.S. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\nNeuroscience products achieved sales of $7.0 billion, representing an increase of 7.1% as compared to the prior year. Paliperidone long-acting injectables growth was driven by sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA /XEPLION  (paliperidone palmitate) and INVEGA TRINZA /TREVICTA  from new patient starts and persistence as well as the launch of INVEGA HAFYERA\u2122. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\nOncology products achieved sales of $14.5 billion in 2021, representing an increase of 17.6% as compared to the prior year. Contributors to the growth were strong sales of DARZALEX (daratumumab) driven by continued strong market growth, share gains in all regions and solid uptake of the subcutaneous formulation launched in 2020; the continued global launch uptake of ERLEADA  (apalutamide) and IMBRUVICA  (ibrutinib) growth primarily driven by market and continued share leadership. The growth of IMBRUVICA  (ibrutinib) was partially offset by competitive pressures from novel oral agents and COVID-19 related market dynamics including delays in new patient starts. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\nPulmonary Hypertension products achieved sales of $3.5 billion, representing an increase of 9.6% as compared to the prior year. Sales growth of OPSUMIT (macitentan) and UPTRAVI (selexipag) were due to continued share gains and market growth. \u00ae \u00ae\n\nCardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $4.5 billion, a decline of 8.6% as compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily attributable to lower sales of INVOKANA /INVOKAMET  (canagliflozin) due to share erosion and PROCRIT / EPREX (epoetin alfa) due to biosimilar competition. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae",

      "answer": "Johnson & Johnson's 2021 oncology revenue was $14,548 million, while Eli Lilly's 2021 oncology revenue was $3,028.8 million, resulting in a combined oncology revenue of $17,576.8 million. Johnson & Johnson's oncology revenue grew by 17.6% from 2020 to 2021, compared to Eli Lilly's oncology revenue growth of approximately 8.5% (calculated from $2,792.1 million in 2020 to $3,028.8 million in 2021). Therefore, Johnson & Johnson's oncology revenue grew at more than double the rate of Eli Lilly's during the same period.",

      "answer": "Amgen accounted for $180 million in noncash consideration related to the fair value of replacement equity awards issued to employees in connection with its acquisition, reflecting the conversion of outstanding RSU awards under the original vesting conditions. Danaher, on the other hand, disclosed noncash consideration of $150 million in 2024 and $125 million in 2023, which stemmed from its preexisting investments in acquired businesses. These figures reveal that Amgen's approach to structuring acquisitions includes significant employee retention mechanisms through equity compensation, while Danaher leverages prior investment stakes to reduce the cash outlay required at the time of acquisition.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From AMGN's 10-K, extract the $180 million fair value of replacement equity awards as a form of noncash consideration tied to employee RSUs in the acquisition.",
        "Step 2: From DHR's 10-K, extract the noncash consideration amounts of $150 million (2024) and $125 million (2023), which resulted from preexisting investments in acquired businesses.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize by comparing the nature of noncash consideration: Amgen uses equity-based employee compensation to retain talent post-acquisition, while Danaher utilizes prior investments to offset acquisition costs."

This method ensures that the financial statements account for the tax implications of these adjustments as part of the acquisition method of accounting. Similarly, Danaher recognized a specific income tax impact of $2 million related to a component of its accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), indicating the company's application of tax effects to comprehensive income items. Both instances demonstrate how each company incorporates tax impacts into broader financial adjustments, either through pro forma acquisition accounting (Amgen) or through comprehensive income reporting (Danaher), using tax rates to quantify these effects in their respective financial disclosures.",

In order to reflect the occurrence of the acquisition on January 1, 2022, the unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information includes adjustments to reflect: (i) incremental amortization expense based on the fair values of the identifiable intangible assets and inventory step-up; (ii) the additional interest ex pense associated with the issuance of debt to finance the acquisition; (iii) the reclassification of transaction and other acquisition-related costs incurred during the three months ended December 31, 2023, to the year ended December 31, 2022; and (iv) the income tax impact using an estimated effective tax rate applied to the combined entity. The unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of what the consolidated results of operations would have been had the acquisition been completed on January 1, 2022. In addition, the unaudited pro forma financial information is not a projection of future results of operations of the combined company, nor does it reflect the expected realization of any synergies or cost savings associated with the acquisition.\n\n## Acquisition of ChemoCentryx, Inc.\n\nOn  October  20,  2022,  we  acquired  all  of  the  outstanding  stock  of  ChemoCentryx ,  a  publicly  traded  biotechnology  company  focused  on  orally  administered therapeutics  to  treat  autoimmune  diseases,  inflammatory  disorders  and  cancer,  for  $52.00  per  share  in  cash,  representing  a  total  consideration  of  $3.9  billion.  The acquisition,  which  was  accounted  for  as  a  business  combination,  includes  TAVNEOS,  an  orally  administered  selective  complement  5a  receptor  inhibitor  that  was approved by the FDA in October 2021 as an adjunctive therapy for adults with severe active antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody-associated vasculitis (ANCAassociated vasculitis). TAVNEOS is commercialized by us in the United States; for markets outside the United States, TAVNEOS is commercialized by a collaboration partner, and Amgen is entitled to royalties and milestones based on future sales of the product. Upon its acquisition, ChemoCentryx became a wholly owned subsidiary of Amgen, and its operations became included in our consolidated financial statements commencing on the acquisition date.\n\nMeasurement-period adjustments during the year ended December 31, 2023, included changes in the purchase price allocation and total consideration, resulting in a net decrease of approximately $18 million to goodwill.  The adjustments did not have a significant impact on Amgen's results of operations during the year ended December 31, 2023, and would not have had a significant impact on prior-period results if the adjustments had been made as of the acquisition date.",

The estimated fair value of $3.5 billion was determined by using a multi-period ex cess earnings income approach that discounts expected future cash flows to present value by applying a discount rate that represents the estimated rate that market participants would use to value the intangible assets. The developed-product-technology rights are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately 11 years from the acquisition date using the straight-line methodology.\n\nThe estimated fair value of the acquired inventory of $41 million was determined using the comparative sales method, which uses actual or expected selling prices of inventory as the base amount to which adjustments for selling effort and a profit on the buyer's effort are applied. The inventory fair value adjustment was amortized as inventory turned over, which we estimated to be approximately 13 months from the acquisition date.\n\nA net deferred tax liability of $502 million was recognized on the temporary differences related to the book bases and tax bases of the acquired identifiable assets and assumed liabilities, primarily driven by the intangible assets acquired.\n\nThe excess of the acquisition date consideration over the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed of $649 million was recorded as goodwill, which is not deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill value is primarily attributable to the ex pected synergies from the TAVNEOS asset.\n\n## Divestiture of Gensenta \u0130la\u00e7 Sanayi ve Ticaret A.\u015e.\n\nOn November 2, 2022, we sold our shares in G ensenta, a subsidiary in Turkey, to Eczac\u0131ba\u015f\u0131 for net cash proceeds of approximately $130 million. The transaction was accounted for as a sale of a business and did not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations. Upon closing of this transaction, net assets related to Gensenta of $86 million were divested, and during the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a loss on divestiture of $567 million recorded in Other operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income, primarily due to the reclassification of $615 million of cumulative foreign currency translation losses from AOCI into earnings.

In  our  opinion,  the  consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over  financial  reporting  as  of  December  31,  2024,  based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control-Integrated  Framework  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 14, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Ex change Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material  misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated  to  the  audit  committee  and  that:  (1)  relate  to  accounts  or  disclosures  that  are  material  to  the  financial  statements  and  (2)  involved  our  especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.",

Also, projections of any ev aluation of effectiv eness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nTysons, Virginia February 20, 2025",

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\n\n- The increase in net deferred tax liabilities in 2021 is primarily the result of operating lease ROU assets recognized during the period. See Note 15 . (c)\n- The decrease in net deferred tax assets in 2021 is primarily the result of favorable pension plan asset performance reported in the period. See Note 11A . (d)\n- The amounts in 2021 and 2020 are reduced for unrecognized tax benefits of $3.0 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, where we have net operating loss carryforwards, similar tax losses, and/or tax credit carryforwards that are available, under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction, to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position. (e)\n- The decrease in net deferred tax liabilities in 2021 is primarily due to certain initiatives executed in the third quarter of 2021 associated with our investment in the Consumer Healthcare JV. (f)\n- In 2021, Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets ($1.6 billion), and Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ($0.3 billion). In 2020, Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets ($0.9 billion), and Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ($4.1 billion). (g)\n\nWe have carryforwards, primarily related to net operating and capital losses, general business credits, foreign tax credits and charitable contributions, which are available to reduce future U.S. federal and/or state, as well as international, income taxes payable with either an indefinite life or expiring at various times from 2022 to 2041. Certain of our U.S. net operating losses and general business credits are subject to limitations under IRC Section 382.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have not made a U.S. tax provision on $55.0 billion of unremitted earnings of our international subsidiaries. As these earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested overseas, the determination of a hypothetical unrecognized deferred tax liability as of December 31, 2021 is not practicable. The amount of indefinitely reinvested earnings is based on estimates and assumptions and subject to management evaluation, and is subject to change in the normal course of business based on operational cash flow, completion of local statutory financial statements and the finalization of tax returns and audits, among other things. Accordingly, we regularly update our earnings and profits analysis for such events.\n\n## D. Tax Contingencies\n\nFor a description of our accounting policies associated with accounting for income tax contingencies, see Note 1Q.\n\n## Uncertain Tax Positions\n\nAs tax law is complex and often subject to varied interpretations, it is uncertain whether some of our tax positions will be sustained upon audit. As of December 31, 2021, we had $4.5 billion and as of December 31, 2020, we had $4.3 billion in net unrecognized tax benefits, excluding associated interest.\n\n- Tax assets for uncertain tax positions primarily represent our estimate of the potential tax benefits in one tax jurisdiction that could result from the payment of income taxes in another tax jurisdiction. These potential benefits generally result from cooperative efforts among taxing authorities, as required by tax treaties to minimize double taxation, commonly referred to as the competent authority process. The recoverability of these assets, which we believe to be more likely than not, is dependent upon the actual payment of taxes in one tax jurisdiction and, in some cases, the successful petition for recovery in another tax jurisdiction. As of December 31, 2021, we had $1.5 billion in assets associated with uncertain tax positions. These amounts were included in Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets ($1.4 billion) and Other taxes payable ($105 million). As of December 31, 2020, we had $1.3 billion in assets associated with uncertain tax positions. These amounts were included in Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets ($1.1 billion), Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ($122 million) and Other taxes payable ($46 million).\n- Substantially all of these unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact our effective income tax rate.\n\nThe reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How do the risks related to the commercial success of new products at Abbott and Pfizer create financial and operational challenges, particularly considering Abbott's $18.1 billion consolidated indebtedness and Pfizer's uncertainties around the commercialization of its BNT162b2 vaccine and Paxlovid treatment?",
      "answer": "Abbott's ability to maintain revenue and profitability depends heavily on the commercial success of its new products, which involves significant research and development expenditures with no guarantee of success due to risks such as regulatory hurdles, manufacturing issues, or market acceptance. Given Abbott's $18.1 billion consolidated indebtedness as of December 31, 2021, failure to launch commercially successful products could severely impact its financial flexibility and profitability. Similarly, Pfizer faces significant uncertainties in the commercial success of its BNT162b2 vaccine and Paxlovid treatment for COVID-19, including risks related to real-world effectiveness, adverse reactions, regulatory approvals, and market demand. These uncertainties, combined with potential manufacturing and supply chain disruptions, could hinder Pfizer's ability to generate expected revenues. Both companies' financial health is therefore closely tied to the unpredictable commercial outcomes of their key products, with Abbott's high debt levels amplifying the consequences of any failure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Abbott's consolidated indebtedness is $18.1 billion as of December 31, 2021, which reduces financial flexibility and funds available for R&D and operations.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies face high-stakes risks tied to the commercial success of their products. Abbott\u2019s large debt burden exacerbates the financial risk of R&D failures, while Pfizer\u2019s exposure to unpredictable vaccine and treatment demand, along with regulatory and clinical uncertainties, creates operational and financial volatility. The shared connector 'Commercial Success' directly ties both firms\u2019 financial outcomes to the uncertain market performance of their key products."

          "chunk_text": "## Abbott's  research  and  development  efforts  may  not  succeed  in  developing  commercially  successful  products  and technologies, which may cause Abbott's revenue and profitability to decline.\n\nTo remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A risk of failure is inherent in the research  and  development  of  new  products  and  technologies.  Abbott  must  make  ongoing  substantial  expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested.\n\nPromising  new  products  and  technologies  may  fail  to  reach  the  market  or  may  only  have  limited  commercial success  because  of  efficacy  or  safety  concerns,  failure  to  achieve  positive  clinical  outcomes,  inability  to  obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, failure to establish or maintain  intellectual  property  rights,  or  infringement  of  the  intellectual  property  rights  of  others.  Even  if  Abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of Abbott's existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences, changing industry or regulatory standards, or competitors' innovations. Innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of, among other things, entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether  any  of  its  products  under  development  will  be  launched,  whether  it  will  be  able  to  develop,  license,  or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or technologies, or new indications or uses for existing products, may cause Abbott's products or technologies to become obsolete, causing Abbott's revenues and operating results to suffer.\n\n## The manufacture of many of Abbott's products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if Abbott or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing products, Abbott's business could suffer.\n\nThe  manufacture  of  many  of Abbott's  products  is  a  highly  exacting  and  complex  process,  due  in  part  to  strict regulatory  requirements.  Problems  may  arise  during  manufacturing  for  a  variety  of  reasons,  including  equipment malfunction,  failure  to  follow  specific  protocols  and  procedures,  problems  with  raw  materials  or  the  global  supply chain, cyber attacks, natural disasters, and environmental factors. In addition, single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials. If problems arise during the production of a lot or batch of product, those products may have to be discarded. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. Any of these events could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to  customer  relations,  time  and  expense  spent  investigating  the  cause  and,  depending  on  the  cause,  similar losses with respect to other lots, batches or products. To the extent Abbott or one of its suppliers experiences significant manufacturing problems, this could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues and profitability.\n\n## Abbott  has  significant  indebtedness,  which  could  adversely  affect  its  business,  including  decreasing  its  business flexibility.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, Abbott's consolidated indebtedness was approximately $18.1 billion. This consolidated indebtedness could have the effect, among other things, of reducing Abbott's flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, and reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes.\n\nFurther,  Abbott  may  be  required  to  raise  additional  financing  for  working  capital,  capital  expenditures,  future acquisitions  or  other  general  corporate  purposes. Abbott's  ability  to  arrange  additional  financing  or  refinancing  will depend on, among other factors, Abbott's financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond Abbott's control. Consequently, Abbott cannot assure that it will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to Abbott or at all, which could adversely impact Abbott's ability to make scheduled payments with respect to its consolidated indebtedness and its profitability and financial condition.\n\nAdditionally, further borrowing could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit ratings. Abbott's credit ratings reflect each credit rating agency's then opinion of Abbott's financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet its debt obligations. Adverse changes in Abbott's credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future longterm  debt  or  short-term  borrowing  facilities  and  may  limit  financing  options,  including  access  to  the  unsecured borrowing market. Abbott may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce flexibility.",

Any future distribution or sale of our stake in the JV will similarly be subject to prevailing market conditions and other factors at the time of such transaction. Our ability to complete any such future distribution or sale may also be impacted by the size of our retained stake at the time. The uncertainty relating to any separation and public listing transactions (including the announced demerger), their implementation, their timing and their yet to be determined effects on the JV's business may subject us and the JV to risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\n## GENERAL RISKS:\n\n## COVID-19 PANDEMIC\n\nOur business, operations and financial condition and results have been and may continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to varying degrees. The pandemic has presented a number of risks and challenges for our business, including, among others: impacts due to travel limitations and mobility restrictions; manufacturing disruptions and delays; supply chain disruptions and shortages, including challenges related to reliance on third-party suppliers resulting in reduced availability of materials or components used in the development, manufacturing, distribution or administration of our products; disruptions to pipeline development and clinical trials, including difficulties or delays in enrolling certain clinical trials, retaining clinical trial participants, accessing needed supplies, and accruing a sufficient number of cases in certain clinical trials; decreased product demand, due to reduced numbers of inperson meetings with prescribers, patient visits with physicians, vaccinations and elective surgeries, resulting in fewer new prescriptions or refills of existing prescriptions and reduced demand for products used in procedures; reduced product demand as a result of unemployment or increased focus on COVID19 vaccination; challenges presented by reallocating personnel and R&amp;D, manufacturing and other resources to assist in responding to the pandemic; costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including practices intended to reduce the risk of transmission, increased supply chain costs and additional R&amp;D costs incurred in our efforts to develop a vaccine to help prevent COVID-19 and an oral COVID-19 treatment; challenges related to our business development initiatives, including potential delays or disruptions related to regulatory approvals; interruptions or delays in the operations of regulatory authorities, which may delay potential approval of new products we are developing, potential label expansions for existing products and the launch of newly-approved products; challenges operating in a virtual work environment; increased cyber incidents such as phishing, social engineering and malware attacks; challenges related to our intellectual property, both domestically and internationally, including in response to any pressure or legal or regulatory action that could potentially result in us not seeking intellectual property protection for, licensing, or agreeing not to enforce or being restricted from enforcing, intellectual property rights related to our products, including our vaccine to help prevent COVID-19 and an oral COVID-19 treatment; challenges related to conducting oversight and monitoring of regulated activities in a remote or virtual environment; challenges related to our human capital and talent development, including challenges in attracting, hiring and retaining highly skilled and diverse workforce; challenges related to vaccine mandates; and other challenges presented by disruptions to our normal operations in response to the pandemic, as well as uncertainties regarding the duration and severity of the pandemic and its impacts, and government or regulatory actions to contain the virus or control the supply of medicines and vaccines.\n\nWe also face risks and uncertainties related to our efforts to develop and commercialize a vaccine to help prevent COVID-19 and an oral COVID-19 treatment, as well as challenges related to their manufacturing, supply and distribution, including, among others:\n\n- uncertainties inherent in R&amp;D, including the ability to meet anticipated clinical endpoints, commencement and/or completion dates for clinical trials, regulatory submission dates, regulatory approval dates and/or launch dates, as well as risks associated with pre-clinical and clinical data (including the Phase 1/2/3 or Phase 4 data for BNT162b2 or any other vaccine candidate in the BNT162 program or Paxlovid or any other future COVID-19 treatment) in any of our studies in pediatrics, adolescents or adults or real world evidence, including the possibility of unfavorable new pre-clinical, clinical or safety data and further analyses of existing pre-clinical, clinical or safety data or further information regarding the quality of pre-clinical, clinical or safety data, including by audit or inspection;\n- the ability to produce comparable clinical or other results for BNT162b2 or Paxlovid, including the rate of effectiveness and/or efficacy, safety and tolerability profile observed to date, in additional analyses of the Phase 3 trial for BNT162b2 or Paxlovid and additional studies, in real-world data studies or in larger, more diverse populations following commercialization;\n- the ability of BNT162b2 or any future vaccine to prevent, or Paxlovid or any other future COVID-19 treatment to be effective against, COVID-19 caused by emerging virus variants;\n- the risk that more widespread use of the vaccine or Paxlovid will lead to new information about efficacy, safety or other developments, including the risk of additional adverse reactions, some of which may be serious;\n- the risk that pre-clinical and clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments, including during the peer review/publication process, in the scientific community generally, and by regulatory authorities;\n- whether and when additional data from the BNT162 mRNA vaccine program, Paxlovid or other programs will be published in scientific journal publications and, if so, when and with what modifications and interpretations;\n- whether regulatory authorities will be satisfied with the design of and results from these and any future pre-clinical and clinical studies;\n- whether and when submissions to request emergency use or conditional marketing authorizations for BNT162b2 or any potential future vaccines in additional populations, for a booster dose for BNT162b2 or any potential future vaccines (including potential future annual boosters or re-vaccinations), and/or biologics license and/or EUA applications or amendments to any such applications may be filed in particular jurisdictions for BNT162b2 or any other potential vaccines, and if obtained, whether or when such EUA or licenses will expire or terminate;\n- whether and when submissions to request emergency use or conditional marketing authorizations for Paxlovid or any other future COVID-19 treatment and/or any drug applications for any indication for Paxlovid or any other future COVID-19 treatment may be filed in any jurisdiction, and if obtained, whether or when such EUA or licenses will expire or terminate;\n- whether and when any application that may be pending or filed for BNT162b2 or other vaccines that may result from the BNT162 program, Paxlovid or any other future COVID-19 treatment or any other COVID-19 program may be approved by particular regulatory authorities, which will depend on myriad factors, including making a determination as to whether the vaccine's or drug's benefits outweigh its known risks and determination of the vaccine's or drug's efficacy and, if approved, whether it will be commercially successful;\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n21",

      "answer": "ABBV reports specific advertising expenses ($2.2 billion in 2023) but does not disclose a specific dollar amount for overall internal R&D costs, only noting that these costs are expensed as incurred. ABBV also specifies that third-party clinical trial costs are expensed as the contracted work is performed. In contrast, ABT explicitly states that internal R&D costs are expensed as incurred and similarly notes that third-party clinical trial costs are expensed as the contracted work is performed. However, ABT does not provide any specific dollar figure for its R&D expenses. Therefore, while both companies follow similar expense recognition timing for third-party clinical trial costs, only ABBV provides a quantified figure for a related expense category (advertising), and neither company discloses a specific amount for internal R&D costs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From ABBV's 10-K, internal R&D costs are expensed as incurred, and third-party clinical trial costs are expensed as the contracted work is performed. ABBV provides a specific figure for advertising expenses ($2.2 billion in 2023), but no specific dollar amount is disclosed for internal R&D costs.",
        "Step 2: From ABT's 10-K, internal R&D costs are also expensed as incurred, and third-party clinical trial costs are expensed as the contracted work is performed. However, ABT does not disclose any specific dollar amount for its internal R&D expenses.",
        "Step 3: Comparing both disclosures, both companies follow the same expense recognition policy for internal R&D and third-party clinical trial costs, but only ABBV provides a specific figure for a related expense category (advertising), while neither company discloses a specific amount for internal R&D costs."

In 2023, ABT had no liability (and had instead a deferred tax asset of $89 million), and GILD reported $1,201 million in liabilities, for a total of $1,201 million.

      "answer": "Abbott actively manages its shareholder equity by purchasing treasury stock, as seen in the increase from 253,807,494 shares held in treasury in 2023 to 259,774,639 shares in 2024, at a total cost of $16,844 million. This approach directly reduces the number of outstanding shares and signals confidence in intrinsic value. In contrast, Gilead retains financial flexibility by using unvested RSUs as part of its equity compensation strategy, with $1.1 billion of unrecognized compensation cost expected to be recognized over 2.2 years. This defers actual share issuance and dilution until performance or market conditions are met, aligning incentives while preserving near-term liquidity.",

Gilead, on the other hand, estimates cash discounts based on contractual terms, historical customer payment patterns, and expectations regarding future customer payment patterns.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n\n## Note 3 - Revenue (Continued)\n\nAbbott recognizes revenue from product sales upon the transfer of control, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms set forth in the customer contract.  For maintenance agreements that provide service beyond Abbott's standard warranty and other service agreements, revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term. A time-based measure of progress appropriately reflects the transfer of services to the customer. Payment terms between Abbott and its customers vary by the type of customer, country of sale, and the products or services offered. The term between invoicing and the payment due date is not significant.\n\nManagement exercises judgment in estimating variable consideration. Provisions for discounts, rebates and sales incentives to customers, and returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded. Sales incentives to customers are not material. Historical data is readily available and reliable, and is used for estimating the amount of the reduction in gross sales. Abbott provides rebates to government agencies, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations and other private entities.\n\nRebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product. Factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate, which customer or government agency price terms apply, and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate. Using historical trends, adjusted for current changes, Abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid, and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when Abbott records its sale of the product. Settlement of the rebate generally occurs from one to six months after sale. Abbott  regularly  analyzes  the  historical  rebate  trends  and  makes  adjustments  to  reserves  for  changes  in  trends  and  terms  of  rebate  programs.  Historically, adjustments to prior years' rebate accruals have not been material to net income.\n\nOther allowances charged against gross sales include cash discounts and returns, which are not significant. Cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale, and therefore can be reliably estimated. Returns can be reliably estimated because Abbott's historical returns are low, and because sales return terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods. Product warranties are also not significant.\n\nAbbott also applies judgment in determining the timing of revenue recognition related to contracts that include multiple performance obligations. The total transaction price of the contract is allocated to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. For goods or services for which observable standalone selling prices are not available, Abbott uses an expected cost plus a margin approach to estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation.\n\n## Remaining Performance Obligations\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) was approximately $5.5 billion in the Diagnostic Products segment and approximately $440 million in the Medical Devices segment. Abbott expects to recognize revenue on approximately 56 percent of these remaining performance obligations over the next 24 months, approximately 17 percent over the subsequent 12 months and the remainder thereafter.\n\nThese performance obligations primarily reflect the future sale of reagents/consumables in contracts with minimum purchase obligations, extended warranty or service obligations related to previously sold equipment, and remote monitoring services related to previously implanted devices. Abbott has applied the practical expedient described in ASC 606-10-50-14 and has not included remaining performance obligations related to contracts with original expected durations of one year or less in the amounts above.\n\n## Assets Recognized for Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer\n\nAbbott has applied the practical expedient in ASC 340-40-25-4 and records as an expense the incremental costs of obtaining contracts with customers in the period of occurrence when the amortization period of the asset that Abbott otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. Upfront commission fees paid to sales personnel as a result of obtaining or renewing contracts with customers are incremental to obtaining the contract. Abbott capitalizes these amounts as contract costs. Capitalized commission fees are amortized based on the contract duration to which the assets relate which ranges from two to ten years. The amounts as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were not significant.",

          "chunk_text": "## Revenue Recognition\n\n## Product Sales\n\nWe recognize revenue from product sales when control of the product transfers to the customer, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, or in certain cases, upon the corresponding sales by our customer to a third party. Revenues are recognized net of estimated rebates and chargebacks, patient co-pay assistance, prompt pay discounts, distributor fees, sales return provisions and other related deductions. These deductions to product sales are referred to as gross-to-net deductions and are estimated and recorded in the period in which the related product sales occur. Our payment terms to customers generally range from 30 to 90 days; however, payment terms differ by jurisdiction, by customer and, in some instances, by type of product. Revenues from product sales, net of gross-to-net deductions, are recorded only to the extent a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized is not probable of occurring when the uncertainty associated with gross-to-net deductions is subsequently resolved. Taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from customers are excluded from product sales. If we expect, at contract inception, that the period between the transfer of control and corresponding payment from the customer will be one year or less,  we  do  not  adjust  the  amount  of  consideration  for  the  effects  of  a  financing  component.  Shipping  and  handling  activities  are  considered  to  be  fulfillment activities and not a separate performance obligation.\n\n## Gross-to-Net Deductions\n\n## Rebates and Chargebacks\n\nRebates and chargebacks are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements and include amounts due to payers and healthcare providers under various programs. These amounts may vary by product, payer and individual plans. Providers qualified under certain programs can purchase our products through wholesalers or other distributors at a discount. The wholesalers or distributors then charge the discount back to us.\n\nRebates and chargebacks are estimated primarily based on product sales, including product mix and pricing, historical and estimated payer mix and discount rates, among other inputs, which require significant estimates and judgment. We assess and update our estimates each reporting period to reflect actual claims and other current information.\n\nChargebacks that are payable to our direct customers are generally classified as reductions of Accounts receivable on our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets. Rebates that are payable to third party payers and healthcare providers are recorded in Accrued rebates on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Patient Co-Pay Assistance\n\nCo-pay assistance represents financial assistance to qualified patients, assisting them with prescription drug co-payments required by insurance. Our accrual for co-pay is based on an estimate of claims and the cost per claim that we expect to receive associated with inventory that exists in the distribution channel at period end.\n\n## Cash Discounts\n\nWe estimate  cash  discounts  based  on  contractual  terms,  historical  customer  payment  patterns  and  our  ex pectations  regarding  future  customer  payment patterns.\n\n## Distributor Fees\n\nUnder  our  inventory  management  agreements  with  our  significant  U.S.  wholesalers,  we  pay  the  wholesalers  a  fee  primarily  for  compliance  with  certain contractually-determined covenants such as the maintenance of agreed-upon inventory levels. These distributor fees are based on a contractually-determined fixed percentage of sales.\n\n## Allowance for Sales Returns\n\nAllowances are made for estimated sales returns by our customers and are recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized. We typically permit returns if the product is damaged, defective, or otherwise cannot be used by the customer. In the U.S., we typically permit returns six months prior to and up to one year after the product expiration date. Outside the U.S., returns are only allowed in certain countries on a limited basis.\n\nOur estimates of sales returns are based primarily on analysis of our historical product return patterns, industry information reporting the return rates for similar products and contractual agreement terms. We also take into consideration known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product.\n\n## Royalty, Contract and Other Revenues\n\nRoyalty revenue is recognized in the period in which the obligation is satisfied and the corresponding sales by our corporate partners occur. Contract and other revenues are recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied.",

UnitedHealth\u2019s pharmacy services revenue model is directly tied to the number of prescription transactions dispensed through its network of pharmacies. If Gilead\u2019s branded medications see reduced prescription volumes due to illegal importation or counterfeit versions entering the market, the number of transactions for those medications in UnitedHealth\u2019s network could decline. Since UnitedHealth recognizes product revenues when prescriptions are dispensed and bills based on the number of transactions, a drop in Gilead-related prescriptions would directly lower the volume of transactions and thus reduce pharmacy services revenue tied to those products.",

The difference between the two is 359 million shares. This difference reflects the distinct capital structures of the two companies, with AbbVie having a larger share base, potentially due to differences in financing strategies, stock issuance, or buyback activities.",

      "question": "How might the potential for increased borrowing costs due to credit rating deterioration, as described in both AbbVie's and CVS's 2022 10-K filings, influence their respective strategies regarding future acquisitions and debt financing?",
      "answer": "Both AbbVie and CVS acknowledge in their 10-K filings that pursuing acquisitions could lead to significant debt, which may negatively impact their credit ratings and subsequently increase borrowing costs. AbbVie specifically notes that greater than expected costs or difficulties integrating acquisitions could cause a deterioration of its credit rating, leading to higher interest expenses. CVS also highlights that financing acquisitions through debt could similarly affect its creditworthiness and borrowing costs. Therefore, the potential for increased borrowing costs due to credit rating deterioration may cause both companies to be more cautious in pursuing future acquisitions, potentially limiting deal size, seeking alternative financing methods, or placing greater emphasis on integration success to avoid credit downgrades.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From AbbVie's 10-K, the company states that acquisitions may lead to greater than expected costs or integration difficulties, which could cause a deterioration in its credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs.",
        "Step 2: From CVS's 10-K, the company acknowledges that financing acquisitions through debt could lead to similar credit rating risks and higher borrowing costs.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize that both companies explicitly link acquisition-driven debt to potential credit rating impacts and higher borrowing costs, suggesting that this shared risk could influence their strategic decisions around M&A and capital structure."

          "chunk_text": "- political and economic instability, including as a result of the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union and the COVID-19 pandemic;\n- sovereign debt issues;\n- price and currency exchange controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization and other governmental action and regulation;\n- inflation, recession and fluctuations in interest rates;\n- restrictions on transfers of funds;\n- potential deterioration in the economic position and credit quality of certain non-U.S. countries; and\n- potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anti-corruption, anti-bribery and other similar laws and regulations, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act.\n\nEvents contemplated by these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenues and profitability.\n\n## If AbbVie does not effectively and profitably commercialize its products, AbbVie's revenues and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\nAbbVie must effectively and profitably commercialize its principal products by creating and meeting continued market demand; achieving market acceptance and generating product sales; ensuring that the active pharmaceutical ingredient(s) for a product and the finished product are manufactured in sufficient quantities and in compliance with requirements of the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies and with acceptable quality and pricing to meet commercial demand; and ensuring that the entire supply chain efficiently and consistently delivers AbbVie's products to its customers. The commercialization of AbbVie products may not be successful due to, among other things, unexpected challenges from competitors, new safety issues or concerns being reported that may impact or narrow approved indications, the relative price of AbbVie's product as compared to alternative treatment options and changes to a product's label that further restrict its marketing. If the commercialization of AbbVie's principal products is unsuccessful, AbbVie's ability to generate revenue from product sales will be adversely affected.\n\n## AbbVie may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or dispose of assets, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability.\n\nAbbVie may pursue acquisitions, technology licensing arrangements, joint ventures and strategic alliances, or dispose of some of its assets, as part of its business strategy. AbbVie may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If AbbVie is successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. AbbVie may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. AbbVie could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or dispositionrelated charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of AbbVie's credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense.\n\nAdditionally, changes in AbbVie's structure, operations, revenues, costs, or efficiency resulting from major transactions such as acquisitions, divestitures, mergers, alliances, joint ventures, restructurings or other strategic initiatives, may result in greater than expected costs, may take longer than expected to complete or encounter other difficulties, including the need for regulatory approval where appropriate.\n\n## AbbVie is dependent on wholesale distributors for distribution of its products in the United States and, accordingly, its results of operations could be adversely affected if they encounter financial difficulties.\n\nIn 2021, three wholesale distributors (McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Corporation) accounted for substantially all of AbbVie's pharmaceutical product sales in the United States. If one of its significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties, such distributor may decrease the amount of business that it does with AbbVie, and AbbVie may be unable to collect all the amounts that the distributor owes it on a timely basis or at all, which could negatively impact AbbVie's business and results of operations.",

As we seek to reduce general and administrative expenses, we must balance the potential impact of cost-saving measures on our customers and other services and performances. If we misjudge the effects of such measures, customers and other services may be adversely affected. We depend on third parties for certain of our customer service, PBM and prescription delivery operations. If we or our vendors fail to provide service that meets our customers' and members' expectations, we may have difficulty retaining or profitably growing our customer base and/or membership, which could adversely affect our operating results. For example, noncompliance with any privacy or security laws or regulations or any security breach involving us or one of our third-party vendors could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, operating results, brand and reputation.\n\nWe and our vendors have experienced and continue to experience cyber attacks. We can provide no assurance that we or our vendors will be able to detect, prevent or contain the effects of such attacks or other information security (including cybersecurity) risks or threats in the future.\n\nWe and our vendors have experienced diverse cyber attacks and expect to continue to experience cyber attacks going forward. As examples, the Company and its vendors have experienced attempts to gain access to systems, denial of service attacks, attempted malware infections, account takeovers, scanning activity, and phishing emails. Attacks can originate from external criminals, terrorists, nation states, or internal actors. The Company is dedicating and will continue to dedicate significant resources and incur significant expenses to maintain and update on an ongoing basis the systems and processes that are",

      "question": "What is the combined change in the Weighted-Average Shares-Diluted between Pfizer Inc. and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. from 2022 to 2023, and how does this change compare as a percentage of their respective 2022 values?",
      "answer": "The combined change in Weighted-Average Shares-Diluted is a decrease of 1 million shares for Pfizer Inc. (from 5,733 million in 2022 to 5,709 million in 2023) and a decrease of 6 million shares for Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (from 394 million in 2022 to 388 million in 2023), resulting in a total decrease of 7 million shares. Pfizer's change represents a 0.21% decrease relative to its 2022 value, while Thermo Fisher's change represents a 1.52% decrease relative to its 2022 value, making Thermo Fisher's reduction proportionally greater.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract Pfizer's Weighted-Average Shares-Diluted for 2022 (5,733 million) and 2023 (5,709 million) from evidence_source_a.",
        "Step 2: Extract Thermo Fisher's Weighted-Average Shares-Diluted for 2022 (394 million) and 2023 (388 million) from evidence_source_b.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the change for each company: Pfizer decreased by 24 million shares (5,709 - 5,733), and Thermo Fisher decreased by 6 million shares (388 - 394).",
        "Step 4: Calculate the percentage change relative to 2022 values: Pfizer decreased by 0.42% (24 / 5,733), and Thermo Fisher decreased by 1.52% (6 / 394).",
        "Step 5: Sum the absolute changes to determine the combined change: 24 million (Pfizer) + 6 million (Thermo Fisher) = 30 million total decrease."

This results in a combined net cash inflow of $22,444 million. In contrast, PFE's net cash flow from financing activities in 2022 was $-14,834 million, indicating a significant turnaround, while TMO's 2022 net cash used in financing activities was $-2,810 million, showing a slight increase in cash outflow.",

      "answer": "The combined total IPR&D impairment charges for the specified assets is $979 million. Johnson & Johnson recorded a $200 million impairment charge in fiscal year 2024 for the M710 (biosimilar) asset, which was fully impaired after a prior $200 million partial impairment in 2023. Merck recorded a $779 million impairment charge in 2023 for MK-7264 (gefapixant) following a Complete Response Letter from the FDA that concluded the drug did not meet substantial evidence of effectiveness. These charges reflect the significant financial risk associated with late-stage drug development, particularly when regulatory outcomes do not support approval despite prior investment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, Johnson & Johnson recorded a $200 million IPR&D impairment charge in 2024 for M710 (biosimilar), with an additional $200 million in 2023, fully impairing the asset.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, Merck recorded a $779 million IPR&D impairment charge in 2023 for MK-7264 (gefapixant) after receiving a Complete Response Letter from the FDA, halting its approval process.",
        "Step 3: Combine the specific impairment amounts for M710 and MK-7264: $200 million (JNJ 2024) + $200 million (JNJ 2023) + $779 million (MRK 2023) = $1,179 million. However, since the question asks for the total recorded in both companies across 2023 and 2024 for these two specific assets, the 2023 JNJ portion is excluded from the total as it refers to the same asset as the 2024 charge. Thus, the total is $200 million (JNJ 2024) + $779 million (MRK 2023) = $979 million.",
        "Step 4: The charges reflect the financial risks of late-stage drug development, as both companies incurred significant losses tied to regulatory setbacks despite substantial prior investment."

A mounts capitalized as IPR&amp;D are accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the projects. Upon successful completion of each IPR&amp;D project, the Company will make a separate determination as to the then-useful life of the asset and begin amortization.\n\nIn 2023, the Company recorded a $779 million IPR&amp;D impairment charge within Research and development expenses related to M K-7264, gefapixant, a  non-narcotic,  oral  selectiv e  P2X 3  receptor  antagonist,  that  was  in  dev elopment  for  the  treatment  of  refractory   or  unex plained  chronic  cough  in  adults.  In December 2023, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) regarding the resubmission of M erck's New Drug A pplication (NDA ) for gefapixant. In the CRL, the FDA concluded that M erck's application did not meet substantial evidence of effectiveness for treating refractory chronic cough and unexplained chronic cough. The CRL was not related to the safety of gefapixant. The marketing application for gefapixant was based on results from the COUGH-1 and COUGH-2 clinical trials. In January  2022, the FDA  issued a CRL regarding M erck's original NDA  for gefapixant. In that CRL, the FDA  requested additional information related to the cough counting system that was used to assess efficacy . Receipt of the second CRL from the FDA  constituted a triggering event that required the evaluation of the gefapixant intangible asset for impairment. The Company estimated the current fair value of gefapixant utilizing an income approach, which calculates the present value of projected future cash flows. The market participant assumptions used to derive the forecasted cash flows were updated to reflect revised market launch plans, resulting in a reduction in the estimated fair value. The revised estimated fair value of gefapixant when compared with its related carrying value resulted in the impairment charge noted above. The remaining intangible asset balance related to Lyfnua (gefapixant) at December 31, 2024 of $21 million is included in product rights in the table above and is being amortized over its expected useful life as supported by projected future cash flows in the markets where it is approved including Japan and the EU.\n\nIn 2022, the Company recorded $1.7 billion of intangible asset impairment charges within Research and development expenses, of which $1.6 billion represents IPR&amp;D impairment charges related to nemtabrutinib (M K-1026), an oral, reversible, non-covalent Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor currently being evaluated for the treatment of hematological malignancies that was obtained through the 2020 acquisition of A rQule. Following discussions with regulatory authorities in the third quarter of 2022, the development period for nemtabrutinib was extended, which constituted a triggering event that required the evaluation of the nemtabrutinib intangible asset for impairment. The Company estimated the current fair value of nemtabrutinib utilizing an income approach which calculates the present value of projected future cash flows. The market participant assumptions used to derive the forecasted cash flows were updated to reflect a delay in the anticipated launch date for nemtabrutinib, which resulted in lower cumulative revenue forecasts and a reduction in the estimated fair value. The revised estimated fair value of nemtabrutinib when compared with its related carrying value resulted in a $807 million impairment charge recorded in the third quarter of 2022. In December 2022, regulatory authorities provided additional feedback with respect to clinical study design that led to a further reassessment of the development plan for nemtabrutinib, which was expected to result in changes to the clinical study design, and corresponding delays in the anticipated approval and launch timelines, which constituted a triggering event. Utilizing an income approach, the forecasted cash flows were updated to reflect a decline in forecasted revenue coupled with an increase in development cost forecasts, which reduced projected cash flows lowering the estimated fair value of nemtabrutinib. The revised estimated fair value of nemtabrutinib when compared with its then-related carrying value resulted in a $780 million impairment charge. The remaining IPR&amp;D intangible asset related to nemtabrutinib is $418 million. If the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of nemtabrutinib prove to be incorrect and the development of nemtabrutinib does not progress as anticipated thereby adversely affecting projected future cash flows, the Company may record an additional impairment charge in the future and such charge could be material. The Company also recorded an $80 million intangible asset impairment charge in 2022 related to derazantinib resulting from the termination of the out-licensing agreement and the decision by M erck not to pursue development of derazantinib.\n\nThe IPR&amp;D projects that remain in development are subject to the inherent risks and uncertainties in drug development and it is possible that the Company will not be able to successfully develop and complete the IPR&amp;D programs and profitably commercialize the underlying product candidates.\n\nThe Company may recognize additional non-cash impairment charges in the future related to marketed products or pipeline programs and such charges could be material.\n\nAggregate amortization expense primarily recorded within Cost of sales was $2.4 billion in 2024, $2.0 billion in 2023 and $2.1 billion in 2022. The estimated aggregate amortization expense for each of the next five years is as follows: 2025, $2.4 billion; 2026, $2.3 billion; 2027, $2.1 billion; 2028, $1.8 billion; 2029, $1.5 billion.",

      "answer": "JNJ records accruals for legal proceedings and product liability claims based on management's judgment and actuarially determined estimates, with self-insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. Claims exceeding insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. In contrast, MRK accrues for legal contingencies when a liability is probable and reasonably estimable, with a portion of the accrual actuarially determined, factoring in past experience, reported claims, and estimates of claims not yet reported. MRK also specifically accounts for defense costs, with reserves of $225 million as of December 31, 2024, based on factors such as trial costs, case progression, and legal strategy. These differences reflect variations in risk management strategies and litigation exposure between the two companies.",

The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\nThe Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GA A P, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. M anagement believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the tax  effect of this repatriation would be approx imately  $0.5 billion under currently  enacted tax  laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates. This amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which may substantially offset this cost.\n\nSee Note 1 and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.\n\nLegal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management's judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated.\n\nThe Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies.

Outside of the U.S., returns are only allowed in certain countries on a limited basis.\n\nMerck's payment terms for U.S. pharmaceutical customers are typically 36 days from receipt of invoice and for U.S. animal health customers are ty pically  30 day s from receipt of inv oice; howev er, certain products hav e longer pay ment terms, including Keytruda , which has payment terms of 90 days. Payment terms for vaccine sales in the U.S. typically range from 30 days to 60 days. Outside of the U.S., payment terms are typically 30 days to 90 days, although certain markets have longer payment terms.\n\nThrough its distribution programs with U.S. wholesalers, the Company encourages wholesalers to align purchases with underlying demand and maintain inventories below specified levels. The terms of the programs allow the wholesalers to earn fees upon providing visibility into their inventory levels, as well as by achieving certain performance parameters such as inventory management, customer service levels, reducing shortage claims and reducing product returns. Information provided through the wholesaler distribution programs includes items such as sales trends, inventory on-hand, on-order quantity and product returns.\n\n## Inventories Produced in Preparation for Product Launches\n\nThe Company capitalizes inventories produced in preparation for product launches sufficient to support estimated initial market demand. Capitalization of such inventory does not begin until regulatory approval is considered by the Company to be probable. The Company monitors the status of each respective product during the research and regulatory approval process. If the Company is aware of any specific risks or contingencies other than the normal regulatory approval process or if there are any specific issues identified during the research process relating to safety , efficacy , manufacturing, marketing or labeling, the related inventory would generally not be capitalized. Expiry dates of the inventory are affected by the stage of completion. The Company manages the levels of inventory at each stage to optimize the shelf life of the inventory in relation to anticipated market demand in order to avoid product expiry issues. For inventories that are capitaliz ed, anticipated future sales and shelf liv es support the realiz ation of the inv entory  v alue as the inv entory  shelf life is sufficient to meet initial product launch requirements. Inventories produced in preparation for product launches capitalized at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $412 million and $790 million, respectively.\n\n## Contingencies and Environmental Liabilities\n\nThe Company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings of a nature considered normal to its business, including product liability , intellectual property , commercial litigation and securities litigation, as well as certain additional matters, including governmental and environmental matters (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company records accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are adjusted periodically as assessments change or additional information becomes available. Generally , for product liability  claims, a portion of the ov erall accrual is actuarially  determined and considers such factors as past experience, number of claims reported and estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported. Individually significant contingent losses are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable.\n\nLegal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable. Some of the significant factors considered in the review of these legal defense reserves are as follows: the actual costs incurred by the Company; the development of the Company's legal defense strategy and structure in light of the scope of its litigation; the number of cases being brought against the Company; the costs and outcomes of completed trials and the most current information regarding anticipated timing, progression, and related costs of pre-trial activities and trials in the associated litigation. The amount of legal defense reserves as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 of approximately $225 million and $210 million, respectively , represents the Company's best estimate of the minimum amount of defense costs to be incurred in connection with its outstanding litigation; however, events such as additional trials and other events that could arise in the course of its litigation could affect the ultimate amount of legal defense costs to be incurred by the Company . The Company will continue to monitor its legal defense costs and review the adequacy of the associated reserves and may determine to increase the reserves at any time in the future if, based upon the factors set forth, it believes it would be appropriate to do so.\n\nThe  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  are  parties  to  a  number  of  proceedings  brought  under  the  Comprehensive  Environmental  Response, Compensation and Liability A ct, commonly known as Superfund, and other federal and state equivalents. When a legitimate claim for contribution is asserted, a liability  is initially  accrued based upon the estimated transaction costs to manage the site. A ccruals are adjusted as site investigations, feasibility studies and related cost assessments of remedial techniques are completed, and as the extent to which other potentially responsible parties who may be jointly and severally liable can be expected to contribute is determined.",

The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\n\nThe Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated.\n\n## Research and development\n\nResearch and development expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development. Upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. A mounts capitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization.\n\nThe Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, to develop and commercialize drug candidates or intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or more) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by one or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these collaborations require upfront, milestone and royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. A mounts due from collaborative partners related to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense because the performance of contract development services is not central to the Company's operations.

A lliance rev enue is recorded net of cost of sales and includes an adjustment to share commercialization costs between the partners in accordance with the collaboration agreement. The adjustment is determined by comparing the commercialization costs M erck has incurred directly and reported within Selling, general and administrative expenses with the costs the collaborative partner has incurred. Research and development costs M erck incurs related to collaborations  are  recorded  within Research and development ex penses.  Cost reimbursements to the collaborative partner or payments received from the collaborative partner to share these costs pursuant to the terms of the collaboration agreements are recorded as increases or decreases to Research and development expenses.\n\nIn  addition,  the  terms  of  the  collaboration  agreements  may  require  the  Company  to  make  payments  based  upon  the  achievement  of  certain developmental, regulatory approval or commercial milestones. Upfront and milestone payments payable by M erck to collaborative partners prior to regulatory approval are expensed as incurred and included in Research and development ex penses.  Payments due to collaborative partners upon or subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized to Cost of sales over the estimated useful life of the corresponding intangible asset, provided that future cash flows support the amounts capitalized. Sales-based milestones payable by M erck to collaborative partners are accrued and capitalized, subject to cumulative amortization catch-up, when determined by the  Company to be probable of being achieved based on future sales forecasts.  The amortization catch-up is calculated either from the time of the first regulatory approval for products that were unapproved at the time the collaboration was formed or, for new indications of approved products, from the time of the formation of the collaboration. The related intangible asset that is recognized is amortized to Cost of sales ov er its remaining useful life, subject to impairment testing.\n\nShare-Based Compensation The Company expenses all share-based payments to employees over the requisite service period based on the grantdate fair v alue of the awards.\n\nRestructuring Costs The Company records liabilities for costs associated with exit or disposal activities in the period in which the liability is incurred. In accordance with existing benefit arrangements, future employee termination costs to be incurred in conjunction with involuntary separations are accrued when such separations are probable and estimable. When accruing these costs, the Company will recognize the amount within a range of costs that is the best estimate within the range. When no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the Company recognizes the minimum amount within the range. Costs for one-time termination benefits in which the employee is required to render service until termination in order to receive the benefits are recognized ratably over the future service period.\n\nContingencies and Legal Defense Costs The Company records accruals for contingencies and legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.\n\nTaxes on Income Deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting based on enacted tax laws and rates. The Company evaluates tax positions to determine whether the benefits of tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the Company recognizes the amount of the benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements. For tax positions that are not more likely  than not of being sustained upon audit, the Company does not recognize any portion of the benefit in the financial statements. The Company recognizes interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of Taxes on Income . The Company accounts for the tax effects of the tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) of certain foreign subsidiaries in the income tax provision in the period the tax arises. The Company's policy for releasing disproportionate income tax effects from AOCL is to utiliz e the item-by -item approach.\n\nReclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation.\n\nUse of Estimates The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GA A P) and, accordingly , include certain amounts that are based on management's best estimates and judgments. Estimates are used when accounting for amounts recorded in connection with acquisitions, including initial fair value determinations of assets and liabilities in a business combination (primarily IPR&amp;D, other intangible assets and contingent consideration), as well as subsequent fair value measurements. A dditionally , estimates are used in determining such items as provisions for sales discounts, rebates and returns, depreciable and amortizable lives, recoverability of inventories, including those produced in preparation for product launches, amounts recorded for contingencies, environmental liabilities, accruals for contingent sales-",

          "chunk_text": "In  2021,  Abbott  management  approved  plans  to  streamline  operations  in  order  to  reduce  costs  and  improve efficiencies  in  various  Abbott  businesses  including  the  diagnostics,  established  pharmaceuticals  and  nutritional businesses. Abbott recorded employee-related severance and other charges of approximately $68 million. Approximately $16 million was recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $4 million was recorded in Research and development, and approximately $48 million was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense. As of December 31, 2021, the accrued liabilities remaining in the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to these actions total $61 million and primarily represent severance obligations.\n\n## Interest Expense and Interest (Income)\n\nInterest expense, net decreased $10 million in 2021 due to the reduction of interest expense driven by lower interest rates in 2021. The effects of higher cash and short-term investment balances were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates on interest income in 2021. In 2020, interest expense, net decreased $76 million due to a reduction in interest expense resulting from the favorable impact of the euro debt financing in November 2019, the repayment of debt in December 2019 and a lower interest rate environment in 2020.\n\n## Debt Extinguishment Costs\n\nOn December 19, 2019, Abbott redeemed the $2.850 billion principal amount of its 2.9% Notes due 2021. Abbott incurred a charge of $63 million related to the early repayment of this debt.\n\n## Other (Income) Expense, net\n\nOther (income) expense, net includes income of approximately $270 million, $205 million and $225 million in 2021,  2020  and  2019,  respectively,  related  to  the  non-service  cost  components  of  the  net  periodic  benefit  costs associated with the pension and post-retirement medical plans. Other (income) expense, net also includes a gain on the sale  of  an  equity  method  investment  in  2021  and  equity  investment  impairments  that  totaled  approximately  $115 million in 2020.\n\n## Taxes on Earnings\n\nThe income tax rates on earnings from continuing operations were 13.9 percent in 2021, 10.0 percent in 2020, and 9.6 percent in 2019.\n\nIn 2021, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include approximately $145 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation and approximately $55 million of net tax benefits as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years.\n\nIn 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include the recognition of approximately $170 million of tax benefits associated with the impairment of certain assets, approximately $140 million of net tax benefits as a result of the  resolution  of  various  tax  positions  related  to  prior  years,  and  approximately  $100  million  in  excess  tax  benefits associated with share-based compensation. In 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations also include a $26 million increase to the transition tax liability associated with the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The $26 million increase to the transition tax liability was the result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. This adjustment increased the cumulative net tax expense related to the TCJA to $1.53 billion. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining balance of Abbott's transition tax obligation is approximately $794 million, which will be paid over the next five years as allowed by the TCJA. Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, in 2020 reflect the recognition of $24 million of net tax benefits primarily as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. In 2019,  taxes  on  earnings  from  continuing  operations  included  approximately  $100  million  in  excess  tax  benefits associated with share-based compensation, an $86 million reduction of the transition tax and $68 million of tax expense resulting from tax legislation enacted in the fourth quarter of 2019 in India. The $86 million reduction to the transition tax liability was the result of the issuance of final transition tax regulations by the U.S. Department of Treasury in 2019.\n\nExclusive of these discrete items, tax expense was favorably impacted by lower tax rates and tax exemptions on foreign income primarily derived from operations in Puerto Rico, Switzerland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Costa Rica, Singapore,  and  Malta. Abbott  benefits  from  a  combination  of  favorable  statutory  tax  rules,  tax  rulings,  grants,  and exemptions in these tax jurisdictions. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for a full reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate.\n\n## Research and Development Programs\n\nAbbott currently has numerous pharmaceutical, medical devices, diagnostic and nutritional products in development.",

Pro forma adjustments were tax effected at the company's historical statutory rates in effect for the respective periods. The unaudited pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of the combined results of operations that would have been realized had the acquisitions and related financings occurred on the aforementioned dates, nor are they meant to be indicative of any anticipated combined results of operations that the company will experience after the transaction. In addition, the amounts do not include any adjustments for actions that may be taken following the completion of the transaction, such as expected cost savings, operating synergies, or revenue enhancements that may be realized subsequent to the transaction.\n\nPro forma net income attributable to Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2021, excludes $312 million of transaction costs, initial restructuring costs, and debt extinguishment costs directly attributable to the PPD acquisition that were included in the determination of net income attributable to Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. for that period.

Brammer Bio is a leading viral vector contract development and manufacturing organization for gene and cell therapies. The acquisition expanded the segment's contract manufacturing capabilities. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the identifiable net assets and, accordingly, $938 million was allocated to goodwill, $405 million of which is tax deductible.\n\nIn addition, in 2019 the company acquired, within the Analytical Instruments segment, a Slovakia-based provider of mass spectrometry software used for identification of compounds, and, within the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, an active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing facility in Cork, Ireland, for an aggregate purchase price of $169 million.",

          "chunk_text": "Income Taxes -Abbott operates  in  numerous  countries  where  its  income  tax  returns  are  subject  to  audits  and adjustments. Because Abbott operates globally, the nature of the audit items is often very complex, and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country. Abbott employs internal and external  tax  professionals  to  minimize  audit  adjustment  amounts  where  possible.  In  accordance  with  the  accounting rules relating to the measurement of tax contingencies, in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit, the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position, and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit. Application of these rules requires a significant amount of judgment. In the U.S., Abbott's federal income tax returns through 2016 are settled. Undistributed foreign earnings remain indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax  liability  related  to  any  remaining  undistributed  foreign  earnings  not  subject  to  the  transition  tax  and  additional outside basis difference in its foreign entities is not practicable.\n\nPension  and  Post-Employment  Benefits - Abbott  offers  pension  benefits  and  post-employment  health  care  to many of its employees. Abbott engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under these  programs. Abbott  must  develop  long-term  assumptions,  the  most  significant  of  which  are  the  health  care  cost trend rates, discount rates and the expected return on plan assets. The discount rates used to measure liabilities were determined based on high-quality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits. The health care cost trend rates represent Abbott's expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and are a forward projection of health care costs as of the measurement date. A difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates, which will not be known for years, can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs. The impact of higher interest rates and improved asset returns during 2021 significantly decreased the net actuarial losses for these plans. At December 31, 2021, pretax net actuarial losses and prior service costs and (credits) recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were net losses of $3.1 billion for Abbott's defined benefit plans and net losses of $373 million for Abbott's medical and dental plans. Actuarial losses and gains  are  amortized  over  the  remaining  service  attribution  periods  of  the  employees  under  the  corridor  method,  in accordance with the rules for accounting for post-employment benefits. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a five-year period.\n\nValuation of Intangible Assets - Abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that Abbott records  at  fair  value  at  the  acquisition  date.  Transactions  involving  the  purchase  or  sale  of  intangible  assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the  value  of  the  intangible  asset.  Abbott  engages  independent  valuation  experts  who  review  Abbott's  critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles. Abbott reviews definite-lived intangible assets for  impairment  each  quarter  using  an  undiscounted  net  cash  flows  approach.  If  the  undiscounted  cash  flows  of  an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the  review  is  applied  at  the  lowest  group  level  for  which  cash  flows  are  identifiable.  Goodwill  and  indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development acquired in a business combination, are reviewed for  impairment  annually  or  when  an  event  that  could  result  in  impairment  occurs. At  December  31,  2021,  goodwill amounted to $23.2 billion and net intangibles amounted to $12.7 billion. Amortization expense in continuing operations for  intangible  assets  amounted  to  $2.0  billion  in  2021,  $2.1  billion  in  2020  and  $1.9  billion  in  2019. There  was  no reduction of goodwill relating to impairments in 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nLitigation - Abbott  accounts  for  litigation  losses  in  accordance  with  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 450, 'Contingencies.' Under ASC No. 450, loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made,  a  minimum  loss  contingency  amount  is  recorded.  These  estimates  are  often  initially  developed  substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known, and the estimates are refined each accounting period as additional information becomes  known. Accordingly, Abbott  is  often  initially  unable  to  develop  a  best  estimate  of  loss,  and  therefore  the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is  increased,  resulting  in  additional  loss  provisions,  or  a  best  estimate  can  be  made,  also  resulting  in  additional  loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. Abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately $30  million  to  $45  million  for  its  legal  proceedings  and  environmental  exposures.  Accruals  of  approximately  $40 million  have  been  recorded  at  December  31,  2021  for  these  proceedings  and  exposures.  These  accruals  represent management's best estimate of probable loss, as defined by FASB ASC No. 450, 'Contingencies.'",

          "chunk_text": "In  2021,  Abbott  management  approved  plans  to  streamline  operations  in  order  to  reduce  costs  and  improve efficiencies  in  various  Abbott  businesses  including  the  diagnostics,  established  pharmaceuticals  and  nutritional businesses. Abbott recorded employee-related severance and other charges of approximately $68 million. Approximately $16 million was recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $4 million was recorded in Research and development, and approximately $48 million was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense. As of December 31, 2021, the accrued liabilities remaining in the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to these actions total $61 million and primarily represent severance obligations.\n\n## Interest Expense and Interest (Income)\n\nInterest expense, net decreased $10 million in 2021 due to the reduction of interest expense driven by lower interest rates in 2021. The effects of higher cash and short-term investment balances were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates on interest income in 2021. In 2020, interest expense, net decreased $76 million due to a reduction in interest expense resulting from the favorable impact of the euro debt financing in November 2019, the repayment of debt in December 2019 and a lower interest rate environment in 2020.\n\n## Debt Extinguishment Costs\n\nOn December 19, 2019, Abbott redeemed the $2.850 billion principal amount of its 2.9% Notes due 2021. Abbott incurred a charge of $63 million related to the early repayment of this debt.\n\n## Other (Income) Expense, net\n\nOther (income) expense, net includes income of approximately $270 million, $205 million and $225 million in 2021,  2020  and  2019,  respectively,  related  to  the  non-service  cost  components  of  the  net  periodic  benefit  costs associated with the pension and post-retirement medical plans. Other (income) expense, net also includes a gain on the sale  of  an  equity  method  investment  in  2021  and  equity  investment  impairments  that  totaled  approximately  $115 million in 2020.\n\n## Taxes on Earnings\n\nThe income tax rates on earnings from continuing operations were 13.9 percent in 2021, 10.0 percent in 2020, and 9.6 percent in 2019.\n\nIn 2021, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include approximately $145 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation and approximately $55 million of net tax benefits as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years.\n\nIn 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include the recognition of approximately $170 million of tax benefits associated with the impairment of certain assets, approximately $140 million of net tax benefits as a result of the  resolution  of  various  tax  positions  related  to  prior  years,  and  approximately  $100  million  in  excess  tax  benefits associated with share-based compensation. In 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations also include a $26 million increase to the transition tax liability associated with the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The $26 million increase to the transition tax liability was the result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. This adjustment increased the cumulative net tax expense related to the TCJA to $1.53 billion. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining balance of Abbott's transition tax obligation is approximately $794 million, which will be paid over the next five years as allowed by the TCJA. Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, in 2020 reflect the recognition of $24 million of net tax benefits primarily as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. In 2019,  taxes  on  earnings  from  continuing  operations  included  approximately  $100  million  in  excess  tax  benefits associated with share-based compensation, an $86 million reduction of the transition tax and $68 million of tax expense resulting from tax legislation enacted in the fourth quarter of 2019 in India. The $86 million reduction to the transition tax liability was the result of the issuance of final transition tax regulations by the U.S. Department of Treasury in 2019.\n\nExclusive of these discrete items, tax expense was favorably impacted by lower tax rates and tax exemptions on foreign income primarily derived from operations in Puerto Rico, Switzerland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Costa Rica, Singapore,  and  Malta. Abbott  benefits  from  a  combination  of  favorable  statutory  tax  rules,  tax  rulings,  grants,  and exemptions in these tax jurisdictions. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for a full reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate.\n\n## Research and Development Programs\n\nAbbott currently has numerous pharmaceutical, medical devices, diagnostic and nutritional products in development.",

      "answer": "CVS uses revenue multiples as unobservable inputs to value privately placed equity securities, analyzing each investment's financial statements and cash flow projections to determine fair value. An increase or decrease in these multiples would directly affect the fair value measurement. In contrast, MDT uses revenue multiples as part of its goodwill impairment testing, relying on comparable public company information to estimate the fair value of reporting units. These differing applications show that CVS applies revenue multiples at the security level for private equity valuation, while MDT applies them at the business unit level for impairment analysis.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - CVS uses 'revenue multiples' as unobservable inputs for valuing privately placed equity securities, with changes in these multiples directly affecting fair value measurements.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies use revenue multiples, but in different financial reporting contexts: CVS for private equity valuation and MDT for goodwill impairment testing. The mechanisms differ, with CVS focusing on individual investment analysis and MDT focusing on broader business unit valuation."

      "answer": "CVS provides a detailed breakdown of how it classifies and manages its current investments, including specific methodologies for debt securities, equity securities, and mortgage loans. It explains that debt securities are classified as current or long-term based on contractual maturities or the intent to sell within twelve months, and it outlines a structured process for evaluating credit-related impairments and non-credit-related losses. This indicates a more structured and market-sensitive approach to managing investment risk and liquidity. In contrast, MDT references 'current investments' only in the context of its overall liquidity and flexibility, stating that its cash, cash equivalents, current investments, and credit facilities will satisfy its current and future obligations. MDT does not specify the composition or management methodology of its current investments, suggesting a more generalized reliance on liquidity without the same level of detail or risk segmentation as CVS. This difference reflects that CVS adopts a more granular and proactive strategy for managing investment-related liquidity risks, while MDT emphasizes broad financial strength and flexibility without elaborating on specific investment management practices.",

      "answer": "Abbott targets R&D spending at approximately 7% of total sales in 2025, indicating a clear, strategic approach to maintaining competitive innovation across its diversified healthcare portfolio. In contrast, Lilly explicitly states that due to the high risk and uncertainty in pharmaceutical R&D, it cannot reliably estimate the total costs or future revenue potential of its development projects, and project-level cost data are considered insufficiently reliable for external reporting. This implies that Abbott's R&D pipeline is managed with greater predictability and financial transparency, while Lilly's pipeline faces higher financial and developmental unpredictability due to the nature of pharmaceutical research.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, extract Abbott's stated R&D spending target of approximately 7% of total sales in 2025, showing a clear and strategic financial commitment to innovation.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, extract Lilly's acknowledgment that it cannot reliably estimate R&D costs or future revenue due to the high risk and uncertainty in pharmaceutical development, and that project-level cost data are not sufficiently reliable for reporting.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the two perspectives: Abbott's predictable and externally communicated R&D spending target contrasts with Lilly's inability to provide such estimates, suggesting differing levels of pipeline maturity, diversification, or risk exposure in their innovation strategies."

In addition, Abbott continues to expand existing brands into new markets, implement product enhancements that provide value to patients and acquire strategic products and technology through licensing activities. Abbott is also actively working on the further development of several key brands such as Creon\u2122, Duphaston\u2122, Femoston\u2122 and Influvac\u2122. Depending on the product, the activities focus on development of new data, markets, formulations, delivery systems, or indications.\n\nMedical Devices - Abbott's research and development programs focus on:\n\n- Cardiac  Rhythm Management - Development of next-generation rhythm management technologies, including advanced communication capabilities and leadless pacing therapies.\n- Heart Failure - Continued enhancements to Abbott's mechanical circulatory support and pulmonary artery pressure systems, including enhanced clinical performance and usability.\n- Electrophysiology - Development of next-generation technologies in the areas of ablation, diagnostic, mapping, and visualization and recording.\n- Vascular - Development of next-generation technologies for use in coronary and peripheral vascular procedures.\n- Structural Heart - Development of transcatheter and surgical devices for the repair and replacement of heart valves, and occlusion therapies for congenital heart defects and stroke-risk reduction.\n- Neuromodulation  -  Development  of  clinical  evidence  and  next-generation  technologies  leveraging  digital  health  to  support  improved  patient  clinical outcomes, physician engagement, and expanded indications in the treatment of chronic pain, movement disorders and other indications.\n- Diabetes Care - Develop enhancements and additional indications for continuous monitoring products to help patients improve their ability to manage diabetes and for use beyond diabetes.\n\nNutritionals - Abbott is focusing its research and development spend on platforms that span the pediatric and adult nutrition areas: gastrointestinal/immunity health, brain health, mobility and metabolism, and user experience platforms. Numerous new products that build on advances in these platforms are currently under development, including clinical outcome testing, and are expected to be launched over the coming years.\n\nCore  Laboratory  Diagnostics  - Abbott  continues  to  commercialize  its  next-generation  blood  and  plasma  screening,  immunoassay,  clinical  chemistry  and hematology systems, along with assays, including a focus on unmet medical needs, in various areas including infectious disease, cardiac care, metabolics, oncology, and neurologic assays as well as informatics solutions to help optimize  diagnostics  laboratory  performance  and  automation  solutions  to  increase  efficiency  in laboratories.\n\nRapid Diagnostics - Abbott's research and development programs focus on the development of diagnostic products for infectious disease, cardiometabolic disease and toxicology.\n\nIn addition, the Diagnostic Products segment continues to pursue the FDA's customary regulatory process for remaining COVID-19 tests for which Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) were obtained and yet to be cleared.\n\nGiven the diversity of Abbott's business, its intention to remain a broad-based health care company and the numerous sources for potential future growth, no individual project is ex pected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years. Factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project over the next year relative to Abbott's total research and development expenses, as well as qualitative factors, such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on Abbott's overall market position. There were no delays in Abbott's 2024 research and development activities that are ex pected to have a material impact on operations.\n\nWhile the aggregate cost to complete the numerous projects currently in development is expected to be material, the total cost to complete will depend upon Abbott's ability to successfully finish each project, the rate at which each project advances, and the ultimate timing for completion. G iven the potential for significant delays and the risk of failure inherent in the development of new products and technologies, it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development. Abbott plans to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spending that will be competitive in each of the businesses in which it participates, and such spending is targeted at approximately 7 percent of total Abbott sales in 2025. Abbott does not regularly accumulate or make management decisions based on the total expenses incurred for a particular development phase in a given period.",

Each project represents only a portion of the ov erall pipeline, and none is indiv idually material to our consolidated research and development expense. While we do accumulate certain research and dev elopment costs on a project lev el for internal reporting purposes, we must make significant cost estimations and allocations, some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor v alidated through accepted control mechanisms.

      "answer": "ABT reported an other comprehensive loss before reclassifications in foreign currency translation adjustments of $1,117 million in 2024, worsening its cumulative balance to $7,505 million. In contrast, LLY experienced a foreign currency translation loss of $580.2 million in 2024 but still improved its cumulative balance to $2,389.6 million due to prior-year positions.

Assets and liabilities that are measured using significant other observable inputs are valued by reference to similar assets or liabilities, adjusted for contract restrictions and other terms specific to that asset or liability. For these items, a significant portion of fair value is derived by reference to quoted prices of similar assets or liabilities in active markets. For all remaining assets and liabilities, fair value is derived using a fair value model, such as a discounted cash flow model or Black-Scholes model. Purchased intangible assets are recorded at fair value. The fair value of significant purchased intangible assets is based on independent appraisals. Abbott uses a discounted cash flow model to value intangible assets. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, the cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis. G oodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually.\n\nSHARE-BASED COMPENSATION - The fair value of stock options and restricted stock awards and units are amortized over their requisite service period, which could be shorter than the vesting period if an employee is retirement eligible, with a charge to compensation expense.\n\nLITIGATION - Abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 450, 'Contingencies.' Under ASC No. 450, loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded. Legal fees are recorded as incurred.\n\nCASH, CASH EQUIV ALENTS AND INVESTMENTS - Cash equivalents consist of bank time deposits, U.S. government securities, money market funds and U.S. treasury bills with original maturities of three months or less. Abbott holds certain investments with a carrying value of $139 million that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Investments held in a rabbi trust and investments in publicly traded equity securities are recorded at fair value and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings. Investments in equity securities that are not traded on public stock exchanges are recorded at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer.\n\nTRADE RECEIV ABLE V ALUATIONS - Accounts receivable are stated at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects  the  current  estimate  of  credit  losses  ex pected  to  be  incurred  over  the  life  of  the  accounts  receivable. Abbott  considers  various  factors  in  establishing, monitoring, and adjusting its allowance for doubtful accounts, including the aging of the accounts and aging trends, the historical level of charge-offs, and specific exposures related to particular customers. Abbott also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country risk, when determining credit limits  for  customers and establishing adequate allowances. Accounts receivable are charged off after all reasonable means to collect the full amount (including litigation, where appropriate) have been exhausted.\n\nINVENTORIES - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value.

      "answer": "LLY significantly increased its capital expenditures from $3.45 billion in 2023 to $5.06 billion in 2024, driven by investments in global manufacturing facilities and agreements that could require up to $14 billion in future payments, primarily for incretin medicines. Additionally, LLY spent $3.35 billion in 2024 on acquired IPR&D, including the acquisition of Morphic, and increased its total debt to $33.64 billion as of December 31, 2024. This reflects a strategy of aggressive investment in business development activities such as acquisitions and collaborations to support long-term growth. In contrast, PFE emphasized optimizing capital allocation as one of its 2025 key priorities, indicating a more measured approach to business development. PFE views business development as an enabler of its strategy but focuses on transactions that directly strengthen its core business, aligning with its broader goals of improving R&D productivity and expanding margins. This contrast highlights LLY's expansionary and capital-intensive strategy versus PFE's disciplined capital management and strategic alignment in its business development activities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - LLY's capital expenditures increased from $3.45 billion (2023) to $5.06 billion (2024), and the company spent $3.35 billion on acquired IPR&D, including Morphic, with total debt rising to $33.64 billion.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - PFE listed 'optimize capital allocation' as one of its 2025 key priorities and described business development as an enabler of its strategy, emphasizing strategic and value-adding transactions.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - LLY is investing heavily in capital projects and acquisitions, increasing debt, and committing to long-term supply agreements, while PFE is focusing on optimizing capital use and selectively pursuing business development opportunities aligned with its strategic goals."

This reflects a tangible, asset-driven strategy to scale operations. In contrast, PFE provided forward-looking guidance on business development activities, emphasizing the expected benefits from its December 2023 acquisition of Seagen, but did not disclose a specific dollar amount for that transaction. As a result, LLY's disclosed acquisition shows a clear immediate financial outlay, while PFE's strategy is framed around anticipated future benefits without a quantified commitment in its 10-K, indicating differing approaches to growth through business development.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - LLY acquired NexPharm Parent HoldCo and Isopro Holdings for $924.7 million in May 2024, aimed at expanding its injectable product manufacturing.",

          "chunk_text": "## Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in ev aluating our company. It is possible that our business, financial condition, liquidity, cash flows, results of operations, reputation, and prospects could be materially adv ersely affected by any of these risks. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believ e to be immaterial could also adv ersely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, cash flows, results of operations, reputation, and prospects.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business and Industry\n\n- Pharmaceutical research and development is very costly and highly uncertain; we may not succeed in developing, licensing, or acquiring commercially successful products sufficient in number or value to replace revenues of products that have lost or will lose intellectual property protection or are displaced by competing products or therapies.\n\nThere are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and dev elopment, the introduction of new products and indications, business development activ ities to enhance or refine our product pipeline, and commercialization of our products.\n\nThere is a high rate of failure inherent in drug discov ery and dev elopment. To bring a product from the discov ery phase to market takes considerable time and entails significant cost. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including in later stages after substantial inv estment and following meaningful cost for manufacturing capabilities and inv entory to prepare for launch. As a result, a significant portion of funds inv ested in research and development programs will not generate direct financial returns. New product candidates that appear promising in dev elopment or prior to being acquired may fail to reach the market or may hav e only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approv als or payer reimbursement or cov erage, failure to obtain placement on guidelines or recommendations published by third-party organizations that are commensurate with clinical data, the application of pricing controls, limited scope of approv ed uses, label changes, changes in the relev ant treatment standards or the av ailability of newer, better, or more cost-effectiv e competitiv e products, difficulty or excessiv e costs to manufacture, insufficient infrastructure to support detection, diagnostic or other requisites for treatment, ineffectiv eness in connecting with healthcare professionals, including digitally through v irtual engagements, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. We may also fail to allocate research and dev elopment resources efficiently, fail to pursue or inv est sufficiently in product candidates or indications that may hav e been successful, or fail to optimally balance trial design, conduct, and speed to accomplish desired outcomes.\n\nRegulatory agencies establish high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products and indications. Delay, uncertainty, unpredictability, and inconsistency in drug approv al processes across markets and agencies can result in delays in product launches, lost market opportunities, impairment of inv entories, and other negativ e impacts. In addition, it can be v ery difficult to predict rev enue growth rates of, or v ariability in demand for, new or future products and indications, which in some cases leads to difficulty meeting product demand or, on the other hand, lower v olume growth, excess inv entory and related financial charges.\n\nWe cannot state with certainty when or whether our products and indications now under dev elopment will be approv ed or launched; whether, if initially granted, such approv al will be maintained; whether we will be able to dev elop, license, or otherwise acquire additional product candidates, indications, or products; or whether our products and indications, once launched, will be commercially successful.\n\nThrough internal innov ation and business dev elopment we must maintain a flow of successful products and indications or line extensions sufficient both to cov er our substantial research and dev elopment costs and inv estments and to replace rev enues that are lost as profitable products become subject to pricing controls, lose intellectual property exclusiv ity, or are displaced by competing products or therapies. Failure to timely replenish our product portfolio and pipeline would hav e a material adv erse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. Our dependence on, or focus in, one or more key products or product classes exacerbates this risk. In addition, the growth of our business and rev enue base increases the risk that products dev eloped or acquired by us may not prov ide adequate v alue to sustain further long-term growth.\n\nWe engage in various forms of business dev elopment activ ities to enhance or refine our product pipeline, including licensing arrangements, codevelopment agreements, co-promotion arrangements, distribution",

      "question": "How do the pricing pressures described in Amgen's and Thermo Fisher Scientific's 2023 10-K filings differ in terms of their sources and financial impacts, particularly with respect to gross margin and inventory risk?",
      "answer": "Amgen faces regulatory-driven pricing pressures stemming from Medicaid rebates, 340B statutory rates, and state-level actions by PDABs in seven U.S. states, as well as international measures such as mandatory price controls, price referencing, and cost-effectiveness assessments in the EU and other markets. These pressures directly affect sales and profitability by limiting pricing flexibility and potentially reducing product usage. In contrast, Thermo Fisher Scientific faces inflation-driven pricing pressures due to elevated inflation rates in the U.S. and other key markets, which increase costs and create downward pressure on gross margins. Additionally, economic instability raises the risk of excess and obsolete inventory, directly impacting inventory management and related financial metrics. The differences in source and impact reflect Amgen's exposure to healthcare-specific regulatory frameworks and Thermo Fisher's sensitivity to macroeconomic conditions affecting broader industrial markets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Amgen's pricing pressures include Medicaid rebates, 340B rates, and international measures such as price controls and cost-effectiveness assessments that impact sales and profitability.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Thermo Fisher faces inflationary pressures that affect gross margins and increase the risk of excess and obsolete inventory.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The pricing pressures affecting Amgen are regulatory and healthcare-specific, while those affecting Thermo Fisher are macroeconomic and industry-wide, leading to distinct financial impacts on gross margin and inventory risk."

      "answer": "Amgen's acquisition of Horizon introduced significant integration challenges, particularly in aligning research and development activities, which are complex, time-consuming, and expensive. These challenges include unanticipated costs, delays, and operational difficulties, such as integrating more than 30 contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs), many of which are single-source suppliers, which could affect the development and commercialization of Horizon's products like TEPEZZA and KRYSTEXXA. In contrast, Thermo Fisher expenses its research and development costs as incurred, which include employee compensation, consultants, facilities-related costs, material costs, depreciation, and travel. This approach reflects a more streamlined and consistent investment in R&D without the added complexity of integrating newly acquired operations, suggesting that Thermo Fisher may experience fewer disruptions to its R&D efficiency compared to Amgen during post-acquisition integration.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Amgen's acquisition of Horizon introduced integration challenges in research and development activities, including over 30 CMOs, some of which are single-source suppliers affecting TEPEZZA and KRYSTEXXA production.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Thermo Fisher expenses R&D costs as incurred, including employee compensation, consultants, facilities, materials, and travel, indicating a consistent and direct investment in innovation.",

Thermo Fisher Scientific had approximately $34.92 billion in outstanding indebtedness as of December 31, 2023, and must maintain a minimum Consolidated Net Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.5:1.0 as per its revolving credit facility.

      "answer": "Medtronic's Diabetes segment total assets increased from $3,930 million in 2023 to $3,996 million in 2024, representing a 1.7% increase. During the same period, Merck reported a decline in diabetes sales, which was cited as one of the factors partially offsetting overall sales growth. Additionally, Merck made strategic moves in the diabetes space, including acquiring global rights to MK-1045, a bispecific antibody for B-cell associated diseases, and acquiring Eyebiotech Limited and Harpoon Therapeutics, signaling a shift in their R&D and commercialization strategy despite declining diabetes sales.",

        "Step 1: Extract from MDT_10k_2024.pdf - MDT states that the ability to achieve synergies among acquired companies, such as increasing sales and combining technologies to develop new products, is a key factor in acquisition success. Delays in product approvals would hinder this process.",
        "Step 2: Extract from MRK_10k_2024.pdf - MRK evaluates IPR&D for impairment at least annually or more frequently if there are delays in clinical development or regulatory approval timelines, which could lead to impairment losses if fair value is less than carrying amount.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are impacted by product approval delays, but in different financial contexts: MDT's acquisition strategy relies on timely product approvals to achieve synergies, while MRK must evaluate IPR&D impairment based on those same delays."

As a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new products and new indications for existing products, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations, and trial endpoints. Unfavorable clinical data from existing or future clinical trials may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals, our position in, and share of, the markets in which we participate, and our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain marketing clearance for our new products or enhancements or modifications to existing products, and the failure to maintain approvals or obtain approval or clearance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Even if we are able to obtain approval or clearance, it may:\n\n- take a significant amount of time,\n- require the ex penditure of substantial resources,\n- involve stringent clinical and pre-clinical testing, as well as increased post-market surveillance,\n- involve modifications, repairs or replacements of our products, and\n- limit the proposed uses of our products.\n\nBoth before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under the U.S. FDA and other applicable non-U.S. government agency regulations. For instance, many of our facilities and procedures and those of our suppliers are also subject to periodic inspections by the U.S. FDA to assess compliance with applicable regulations. The results of these inspections can include, and have in the past included, inspectional observations on the U.S. FDA's Form 483, warning letters, or other forms of enforcement, such as a consent decree. If the U.S. FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical products are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the U.S. FDA could detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such products, refuse to grant pending pre-market approval applications or require certificates of non-U.S. governments for exports, and/or require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health, and in certain rare circumstances, ban medical devices. The U.S. FDA and other non-U.S. government agencies may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us, our officers or employees and impose operating",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\ncircumstances warrant a review, the Company will assess recoverability from future operations using pretax undiscounted cash flows derived from the lowest appropriate asset groupings. Impairments are recognized in operating results to the extent that the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, which is determined based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows.\n\nIPR&amp;D that the Company acquires in conjunction with a business combination represents the fair value assigned to incomplete research projects which, at the time of acquisition, have not reached technological feasibility . The amounts are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, subject  to  impairment  testing  until  completion  or  abandonment  of  the  projects.  The  Company  evaluates  IPR&amp;D  for  impairment  at  least  annually ,  or  more frequently if impairment indicators exist (such as unfavorable clinical trial data, changes in the commercial landscape or delays in the clinical development program and related regulatory filing and approval timelines), by performing a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the IPR&amp;D intangible asset with its carrying value. For impairment testing purposes, the Company may combine separately recorded IPR&amp;D intangible assets into one unit of account based on the relevant facts and circumstances. Generally , the Company will combine IPR&amp;D intangible assets for testing purposes if they operate as a single asset and are essentially inseparable. If the fair v alue is less than the carry ing amount, an impairment loss is recognized in operating results.\n\nThe judgments made in evaluating impairment of long-lived intangibles can materially affect the Company's results of operations.\n\n## Taxes on Income\n\nThe Company's effective tax rate is based on pretax income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. A n estimated effective tax rate for a year is applied to the Company's quarterly operating results. In the event that there is a significant unusual or one-time item recognized, or expected to be recognized, in the Company's quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or one-time item. The Company considers the resolution of prior year tax matters to be such items. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company's tax provision and in evaluating its tax positions. The recognition and measurement of a tax position is based on management's best judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. The Company evaluates tax positions to determine whether the benefits of tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the Company recognizes the amount of the benefit that is greater than 50% likely  of being realiz ed upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements. For tax positions that are not more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the Company does not recognize any portion of the benefit in the financial statements. If the more likely than not threshold is not met in the period for which a tax position is taken, the Company may subsequently recognize the benefit of that tax position if the tax matter is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires, or if the more likely  than not threshold is met in a subsequent period (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\nTax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements.  Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which the Company has already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expense for which the Company has already taken a deduction on the tax return, but has not yet recognized as expense in the financial statements.\n\n## Recently Issued Accounting Standards\n\nFor a discussion of recently issued accounting standards, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Cautionary F actors That May Affect F uture Results\n\nThis report and other written reports and oral statements made from time to time by the Company may contain so-called 'forward-looking statements,' all of which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause results to differ materially from those set forth in the statements. One can identify these forward-looking statements by their use of words such as 'anticipates,' 'expects,' 'plans,' 'will,' 'estimates,' 'forecasts,' 'projects' and other words of similar meaning, or negative variations of any of the foregoing. One can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly  to historical or current facts. These statements are likely to address the Company's growth strategy , financial results, product approvals, product potential, development programs, environmental or other sustainability initiatives. One must carefully consider any",

      "answer": "Merck's 2024 10-K indicates that its diabetes sales declined, contributing to an overall sales performance that was partially offset by growth in other areas. In contrast, Medtronic's Diabetes segment reported $394 million in revenue for fiscal year 2024. This contrast suggests that while Merck experienced a setback in its diabetes-related business, Medtronic maintained a stable, albeit relatively small, presence in the diabetes market.

      "answer": "AbbVie uses its historical return experience to estimate product returns and also engages actuaries to determine pension obligations, relying on assumptions including historical returns on plan assets. Pfizer explicitly states that its expected annual rate of return on plan assets is based on both historical return experience and forward-looking expectations by asset class. A 50 basis point decline in Pfizer's expected annual rate of return on plan assets, holding all else constant, would increase its net periodic benefit cost by an unspecified but significant amount, as illustrated in its sensitivity analysis. This shows how both companies depend on historical return data but Pfizer directly ties it to financial outcomes in benefit cost calculations.",

        "Step 1: From AbbVie's filing, we learn that historical return experience is used in estimating product returns and is considered reliable due to consistency in experience.",

        "Step 4: Synthesizing both, we understand that both companies rely on historical return experience, but Pfizer explicitly ties it to financial impacts on benefit costs, while AbbVie uses it more generally for estimation purposes."

BUSINESS\n\n## Overview\n\nAbbVie is a global, diversified research-based biopharmaceutical company positioned for success with a comprehensive product portfolio that has leadership positions across immunology, hematologic oncology, neuroscience, aesthetics and eye care. AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases. (1)\n\nAbbVie was incorporated in Delaware on April 10, 2012. On January 1, 2013, AbbVie became an independent, publicly-traded company as a result of the distribution by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) of 100% of the outstanding common stock of AbbVie to Abbott's shareholders.\n\n## Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\n\nThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic continues to spread throughout the United States and around the world. As COVID-19 continues to have an impact worldwide, AbbVie is focused on the health and safety of its employees, health care professionals and patients and communities. In the continued operation of its business, AbbVie has followed health and safety guidance from relevant health authorities, managed manufacturing and supply chain resources and monitored closely its clinical trial sites. See Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).\"\n\n## Segments\n\nAbbVie operates as a single global business segment dedicated to the research and development, manufacturing, commercialization and sale of innovative medicines and therapies. This operating structure enables the Chief Executive Officer, as chief operating decision maker (CODM), to allocate resources and assess business performance on a global basis in order to achieve established long-term strategic goals. Consistent with this structure, a global research and development and supply chain organization is responsible for the discovery, development, manufacturing and supply of products. Commercial efforts that coordinate the marketing, sales and distribution of these products are organized by geographic region or therapeutic area. All of these activities are supported by a global corporate administrative staff. The determination of a single business segment is consistent with the consolidated financial information regularly reviewed by the CODM for purposes of assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods. See Note 16, \"Segment and Geographic Area Information\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and the sales information related to AbbVie's key products and geographies included under Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n(1) As used throughout the text of this report on Form 10-K, the terms \"AbbVie\" or \"the company\" refer to AbbVie Inc., a Delaware corporation, or AbbVie Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires.\n\n## PART I",

Segment, Geographic and Other Revenue Information\n\n## A. Segment Information\n\nWe regularly review our operating segments and the approach used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. With the formation of the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2019 and the completion of the spin-off of our Upjohn Business in the fourth quarter of 2020, Pfizer transformed into a more focused, global leader in science-based innovative medicines and vaccines and beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020 operated as a single operating segment engaged in the discovery, development, manufacturing, marketing, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide. At the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, we reorganized our commercial operations and began to manage our commercial operations through a new global structure consisting of two operating segments, each led by a single manager: Biopharma, our innovative science-based biopharmaceutical business and PC1, our global contract development and manufacturing organization and a leading supplier of specialty active pharmaceutical ingredients. Biopharma is a science-based medicines business that includes six therapeutic areas - Oncology, Inflammation &amp; Immunology, Rare Disease, Hospital, Vaccines and Internal Medicine. The Hospital therapeutic area commercializes our global portfolio of sterile injectable and anti-infective medicines.\n\nEach operating segment has responsibility for its commercial activities. Regional commercial organizations market, distribute and sell our products and are supported by global platform functions that are responsible for the research, development, manufacturing and supply of our products and global corporate enabling functions. Biopharma receives its R&amp;D services from GPD and WRDM. These services include IPR&amp;D projects for new investigational products and additional indications for in-line products. Each business has a geographic footprint across developed and emerging markets. Our chief operating decision maker uses the revenues and earnings of the operating segments, among other factors, for performance evaluation and resource allocation. Biopharma is the only reportable segment. We have revised prior-period information (Revenues and Earnings, as defined by management) to conform to the current management structure.\n\n## Other Costs and Business Activities\n\nCertain pre-tax costs are not allocated to our operating segment results, such as costs associated with the following:\n\n- WRDM--the R&amp;D and Medical expenses managed by our WRDM organization, which is generally responsible for research projects for our Biopharma portfolio until proof-of-concept is achieved and then for transitioning those projects to the GPD organization for possible clinical and commercial development. R&amp;D spending may include upfront and milestone payments for intellectual property rights. The WRDM organization also has responsibility for certain science-based and other platform-services organizations, which provide end-to-end technical expertise and other services to the various R&amp;D projects, as well as the Worldwide Medical and Safety group, which ensures that Pfizer provides all stakeholders--including patients, healthcare providers, pharmacists, payers and health authorities--with complete and up-to-date information on the risks and benefits associated with Pfizer products so that they can make appropriate decisions on how and when to use Pfizer's medicines.\n- GPD--the costs associated with our GPD organization, which is generally responsible for clinical trials from WRDM in the Biopharma portfolio, including late-stage portfolio spend. GPD also provides technical support and other services to Pfizer R&amp;D projects. GPD is responsible for facilitating all regulatory submissions and interactions with regulatory agencies.\n- Corporate and Other Unallocated--the costs associated with (i) corporate enabling functions (such as digital, global real estate operations, legal, finance, human resources, worldwide public affairs, compliance and worldwide procurement, among others), all strategy, business development, portfolio management and valuation capabilities, patient advocacy activities and certain compensation and other corporate costs, such as interest income and expense, and gains and losses on investments; (ii) overhead expenses primarily associated with our manufacturing (which include manufacturing variances associated with production) operations that are not directly assessed to an operating segment, as business unit (segment) management does not manage these costs; and (iii) our share of earnings from the Consumer Healthcare JV.\n- Certain transactions and events such as (i) purchase accounting adjustments, where we incur expenses associated with the amortization of fair value adjustments to inventory, intangible assets and PP&amp;E; (ii) acquisition-related items, where we incur costs for executing the transaction, integrating the acquired operations and restructuring the combined company; and (iii) certain significant items, representing substantive and/or unusual, and in some cases recurring, items (such as pension and postretirement actuarial remeasurement gains and losses, gains on the completion of joint venture transactions, restructuring charges, legal charges or net gains and losses on investments in equity securities) that are evaluated on an individual basis by management and that, either as a result of their nature or size, would not be expected to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis. Such items can include, but are not limited to, non-acquisition-related restructuring costs, as well as costs incurred for legal settlements, asset impairments and disposals of assets or businesses, including, as applicable, any associated transition activities.\n\nThe operating results of PC1, our global contract development and manufacturing organization, and through July 31, 2019 our former Consumer Healthcare business are included in Other business activities.\n\n## Segment Assets\n\nWe manage our assets on a total company basis, not by operating segment, as our operating assets are shared or commingled. Therefore, our chief operating decision maker does not regularly review any asset information by operating segment and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by operating segment. Total assets were $181 billion as of December 31, 2021 and $154 billion as of December 31, 2020.\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n101",

In contrast, PFE provides forward-looking guidance indicating that it expects to realize benefits from its business development transactions, although the specific financial impact is not quantified and remains subject to risks such as regulatory approvals, market conditions, and the success of integration efforts.",

The effective income tax rates differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to the impact of foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions, business development activities, changes in enacted tax rates and laws and related restructuring, tax audit settlements and accretion on contingent consideration. The 2020 effective income tax rate included the recognition of a net tax benefit of $1.7 billion related to changes in tax laws and related restructuring, including certain intra-group transfers of intellectual property and deferred tax remeasurement. The effective tax rates for these periods also reflected the benefit from U.S. tax credits principally related to research and development credits, the orphan drug tax credit and Puerto Rico excise tax credits. The Puerto Rico excise tax credits relate to legislation enacted by Puerto Rico that assesses an excise tax on certain products manufactured in Puerto Rico. The tax is levied on gross inventory purchases from entities in Puerto Rico and is included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings. The majority of the tax is creditable for U.S. income tax purposes.\n\n## FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\n",

      "answer": "Thermo Fisher Scientific's short-term obligations decreased by $91 million from 2020 to 2021 ($2,628 million - $2,537 million). UnitedHealth Group's 2021 dividend payout of $8.0 billion was significantly larger in magnitude than Thermo Fisher's 2021 short-term obligations of $2,537 million.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Thermo Fisher's short-term obligations were $2,628 million in 2020 and $2,537 million in 2021.",
        "Step 2: Calculate the change in obligations: $2,628 million - $2,537 million = $91 million decrease.",
        "Step 3: Extract from source B - UnitedHealth Group's regulated subsidiaries paid $8.0 billion in dividends in 2021.",
        "Step 4: Compare the magnitude: UnitedHealth's $8.0 billion dividend payout in 2021 was substantially larger than Thermo Fisher's 2021 short-term obligations of $2,537 million.",
        "Step 5: Synthesize - The comparison reveals that UnitedHealth's 2021 dividend payout exceeded Thermo Fisher's short-term obligations by a factor of more than 3:1, despite Thermo Fisher experiencing a modest decrease in its short-term obligations during the period."

We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before noncash expenses.\n\nOur regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to, among other things, minimum levels of statutory capital, as defined by their respective jurisdictions, and restrictions on the timing and amount of dividends paid to their parent companies.\n\nOur U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $8.0 billion and $8.3 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' for further detail concerning our regulated subsidiary dividends.\n\nOur nonregulated businesses also generate significant cash flows from operations available for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long-term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt and return capital to our shareholders through dividends and repurchases of our common stock.\n\n## Summary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\n",

UNH's total operating lease liability was $4,273 million after subtracting $609 million in imputed interest from total lease payments of $4,882 million.

If realized, this appreciation would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. However, gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders' equity volatility relating to foreign exchange. A 10% appreciation is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in foreign currencies.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the company has unsecured senior Euro notes outstanding, which are exposed to foreign currency risk. The company designated \u20ac3.1 billion aggregate principal amount of these foreign currency denominated notes as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. As a result, any foreign currency translation gains or losses related to the Euro notes will be included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the senior Euro notes and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the net investment hedging program.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nThe company estimates that an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would adversely impact the fair value of AbbVie's interest rate swap contracts by approximately $140 million at December 31, 2024. If realized, the fair value reduction would affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The company estimates that an increase of 100 basis points in long-term interest rates would decrease the fair value of long-term debt by $4.6 billion at December 31, 2024.

At December 31, 2024, the Company had $14,304 million in sales rebate accruals, a large portion of which were for rebates accrued for pharmacy benefit managers, state government Medicaid programs, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans and private entities for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs. In order to establish the rebate accruals, the Company estimated its rebates based on estimates and assumptions, including the determination of the related payer of the rebate based on sales trends, changes in rebate contracts which impacts the applicable price and rebate terms, and the corresponding lag in payment timing.\n\nAuditing the Medicaid, Medicare and managed care sales rebate accruals was complex and required significant auditor judgment because the accruals consider multiple subjective and complex estimates and assumptions. In deriving these estimates and assumptions, the Company used both internal and external sources of information. Management supplemented its historical data analysis with qualitative adjustments based upon changes in rebate trends, rebate programs, contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events which indicate a change in the reserve is appropriate.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's sales rebate accruals for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs. This included testing controls over management's review of the significant assumptions and other inputs used in the estimation of Medicaid, Medicare and managed care rebates, among others, including the significant assumptions discussed above. Specifically, we tested management's controls to evaluate the sufficiency of its reserve estimates by comparing to actual rebates paid, controls over rebate validation and processing, and controls to ensure that the data used to evaluate and support the significant assumptions was complete and accurate.\n\nTo test the sales rebate accruals and assess the historical accuracy of management's estimate for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs, our audit procedures included independently calculating the sales rebate accruals based on historical payments and performing a hindsight analysis on the reserves recorded. Our testing of significant assumptions included corroborating management's estimate of the rebate claims processing lag time for each type of rebate. We evaluated the reasonableness of assumptions considering industry and economic trends, product profiles, and other regulatory factors. For Medicaid, we involved a specialist with an understanding of statutory reimbursement requirements to assess the consistency of the Company's calculation methodologies with applicable government regulations and policy.\n\n2024 Form 10-K |",

At December 31, 2024, the Company had\n\n$11,539.3 million in sales rebate and discount accruals. A large portion of these accruals are rebates associated with sales in the United States for which payment for purchase of the product is cov ered by Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare.\n\nAuditing the Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare sales rebate and discount liabilities is challenging because of the subjectiv ity of certain assumptions required to estimate the rebate liabilities. In calculating the appropriate accrual amount, the Company considers historical Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare rebate payments by product as a percentage of their historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends, the lag in payment timing, changes in rebate contracts, an ev aluation of the current Medicaid and Medicare laws and interpretations, the percentage of products that are sold v ia Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare, and product pricing. Giv en v ariability in prescription drug costs and v ariability in prescription data, historical rebate information may not be predictiv e for management to estimate the rebate accrual and thus, management supplements its historical data analysis with qualitativ e adjustments based upon current expectations, particularly for select products which contribute the largest portion of the Company's rev enue.\n\nWe tested the Company's controls addressing the identified risks of material misstatement related to the v aluation of the sales rebate and discount liabilities.

The acquired definite-lived intangible assets consist of developed product rights and license agreements and are being amortized over a weighted-average estimated useful life of approximately 12 years using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. The estimated fair values of identifiable i ntangible assets were determined using the \"income approach\" which is a valuation technique that provides an estimate of the fair value of an asset based on market participant expectations of the cash flows an asset would generate over its remaining useful life. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of these asset valuations include the estimated net cash flows for each year for each asset or product, the appropriate discount rate necessary to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the life cycle of each asset, the potential regulatory and commercial success risk, competitive trends i mpacting the asset and each cash flow stream, as well as other factors.\n\nOther noncurrent assets primarily consist of $250 million of deferred tax assets.\n\nThe current portion of long-term debt assumed by AbbVie was repaid concurrent with the acquisition at the fair value of $99 million. See Note 10 for additional information.\n\nGoodwill was calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Specifically, the goodwill recognized from the acquisition of ImmunoGen represents expected synergies including, the ability to: (i) expand AbbVie's product portfolio as well as the potential to increase revenue from future growth platforms, (ii) accelerate AbbVie's clinical and commercial presence in the solid tumor space within oncology, (iii) leverage the respective strengths of each company, and (iv) enhance AbbVie's existing ADC development efforts. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.\n\nFollowing the acquisition date, the operating results of ImmunoGen have been included in the consolidated financial statements. For the period from the acquisition date through December 31, 2024, net revenues attributable to ImmunoGen were $578 million and operating losses attributable to ImmunoGen were $682 million, inclusive of $349 million of cash-settled, post-closing expense for ImmunoGen employee incentive awards, $179 million of inventory fair value stepup amortization and $157 million of intangible asset amortization. AbbVie also issued 0.3 million RSUs to holders of ImmunoGen equity awards based on a conversion factor described in the transaction agreement. Stock compensation expense related to RSUs issued at the acquisition date was not significant.\n\nAcquisition-related expenses, which were comprised primarily of regulatory, financial advisory and legal fees, totaled $59 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and were included in SG&amp;A expense in the consolidated statements of earnings.\n\n## Pro Forma Financial Information\n\nThe following table presents the unaudited pro forma combined results of AbbVie, ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics for 2024 and 2023 as if the acquisitions of ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics had occurred on January 1, 2023:\n\n",

      "question": "How do ABBV's acquisition-related tax impacts and LLY's $3.35 billion IPR&D and $947.7 million manufacturing site acquisitions in 2024 compare in terms of business development spending, and what does this indicate about their respective strategic growth priorities?",
      "answer": "ABBV experienced a lower effective tax rate in 2024, partially due to acquisition costs related to business development activities, indicating that strategic acquisitions influenced its tax position. Meanwhile, LLY spent $3.35 billion on IPR&D (primarily related to the acquisition of Morphic) and $947.7 million on a manufacturing site in Wisconsin, showing a significant allocation of capital toward innovation and manufacturing expansion. Comparing the two, ABBV's business development activities influenced its tax efficiency, while LLY's spending reflects a focus on expanding R&D capabilities and production infrastructure, suggesting different strategic emphases despite both engaging in business development activities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From ABBV's 10-K, acquisition costs related to business development activities contributed to a lower effective tax rate in 2024, indicating the strategic importance and financial impact of these activities.",
        "Step 2: From LLY's 10-K, the company spent $3.35 billion on IPR&D (linked to Morphic acquisition) and $947.7 million on a Wisconsin manufacturing site, showing a substantial capital outlay toward innovation and production capacity.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies engaged in business development activities, but with distinct strategic focuses: ABBV leveraged acquisitions for tax optimization, while LLY prioritized R&D and manufacturing expansion."

          "chunk_text": "\nThe effective income tax rate fluctuates year to year due to the allocation of the company's taxable earnings among jurisdictions, as well as certain discrete factors and events in each year, including changes in tax law and business development activities. The effective income tax rates in 2024, 2023 and 2022 differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to the impact of foreign operations with lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, the U.S. global minimum tax, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, tax audits and settlements, tax credits and incentives in the United States, Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions, and business development activities. The effective income tax rate in 2024 was lower than prior periods due to the resolutions of various tax positions pertaining to multiple prior tax years, including the closing of U.S. IRS examinations covering three tax years, partially offset by increases in unrecognized tax benefits pertaining to prior years. The lower effective income tax rate in 2024 also reflects an increase due to acquisition costs related to certain business development activities and a decrease related to changes in fair value of contingent consideration. The effective income tax rate in 2023 was higher than prior periods due to increased changes in fair value of contingent consideration, intangible asset impairments and the impacts of the transition from the Puerto Rico excise tax to an income tax.\n\nIn 2022, Puerto Rico enacted Act 52-2022 (the Puerto Rico Act) allowing for a transition from a Puerto Rico excise tax levied on gross inventory purchases to an income-based tax beginning in 2023. The company completed the transition requirements of the Puerto Rico Act in 2022, resulting in the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities\n\n## 93 | 2024 Form 10-K",

As of December 31, 2024, our material cash requirements primarily related to purchases of goods and serv ices to produce our products and conduct our operations, income tax payments, capital expenditures, div idends, milestone and royalty payments, business development activ ities, share repurchases and repayment of outstanding borrowings (see Notes 14, 4, 3, 13, and 11 to the consolidated financial statements). We anticipate our cash requirements related to ordinary course purchases of goods and serv ices will be consistent with our past lev els relativ e to rev enues.\n\nCapital expenditures were $5.06 billion during 2024, compared to $3.45 billion in 2023. We are making inv estments in global facilities to manufacture existing and future products. These inv estments, and other capital inv estments that support our operations, hav e increased our capital expenditures and will result in meaningfully higher capital expenditures ov er the next sev eral years.\n\nAs we expand our manufacturing capacity in order to meet existing and expected demand of our medicines, we hav e entered, and expect to continue to enter, into v arious agreements for contract manufacturing and for supply of materials. The executed agreements could, under certain circumstances, require us to pay up to approximately $14 billion if we do not purchase specified amounts of goods or serv ices primarily related to our incretin medicines, including medicines in dev elopment, ov er the durations of the agreements, which are generally up to 8 years.\n\nCash and cash equivalents increased to $3.27 billion as of December 31, 2024, compared with $2.82 billion at December 31, 2023. Net cash prov ided by operating activ ities increased to $8.82 billion in 2024, compared with $4.24 billion in 2023. Refer to the consolidated statements of cash flows for additional information on the significant sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nIn addition to our cash and cash equiv alents, we held total inv estments of $3.37 billion and $3.16 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectiv ely. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\nWe paid $3.35 billion in 2024 for acquired IPR&amp;D primarily related to the acquisition of Morphic.

          "chunk_text": "Intangible assets relate to $7.3 billion of definite-lived intangible assets and $1.3 billion of acquired IPR&amp;D associated with products that have not yet received regulatory approval. The acquired definite-lived intangible assets consist of developed product rights and license agreements and are being amortized over a weighted-average estimated useful life of approximately 12 years using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. The estimated fair values of identifiable i ntangible assets were determined using the \"income approach\" which is a valuation technique that provides an estimate of the fair value of an asset based on market participant expectations of the cash flows an asset would generate over its remaining useful life. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of these asset valuations include the estimated net cash flows for each year for each asset or product, the appropriate discount rate necessary to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the life cycle of each asset, the potential regulatory and commercial success risk, competitive trends i mpacting the asset and each cash flow stream, as well as other factors.\n\nOther noncurrent assets primarily consist of $250 million of deferred tax assets.\n\nThe current portion of long-term debt assumed by AbbVie was repaid concurrent with the acquisition at the fair value of $99 million. See Note 10 for additional information.\n\nGoodwill was calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Specifically, the goodwill recognized from the acquisition of ImmunoGen represents expected synergies including, the ability to: (i) expand AbbVie's product portfolio as well as the potential to increase revenue from future growth platforms, (ii) accelerate AbbVie's clinical and commercial presence in the solid tumor space within oncology, (iii) leverage the respective strengths of each company, and (iv) enhance AbbVie's existing ADC development efforts. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.\n\nFollowing the acquisition date, the operating results of ImmunoGen have been included in the consolidated financial statements. For the period from the acquisition date through December 31, 2024, net revenues attributable to ImmunoGen were $578 million and operating losses attributable to ImmunoGen were $682 million, inclusive of $349 million of cash-settled, post-closing expense for ImmunoGen employee incentive awards, $179 million of inventory fair value stepup amortization and $157 million of intangible asset amortization. AbbVie also issued 0.3 million RSUs to holders of ImmunoGen equity awards based on a conversion factor described in the transaction agreement. Stock compensation expense related to RSUs issued at the acquisition date was not significant.\n\nAcquisition-related expenses, which were comprised primarily of regulatory, financial advisory and legal fees, totaled $59 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and were included in SG&amp;A expense in the consolidated statements of earnings.\n\n## Pro Forma Financial Information\n\nThe following table presents the unaudited pro forma combined results of AbbVie, ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics for 2024 and 2023 as if the acquisitions of ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics had occurred on January 1, 2023:\n\n",

      "answer": "The total change in the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts from the beginning to the end of 2023 for both ABT and AMGN combined is a $16 million increase. ABT experienced a $60 million addition to the allowance, offset by $116 million in write-offs, resulting in a $64 million decrease in the allowance balance from $500 million to $444 million. AMGN, on the other hand, added $6 million to its allowance with no other additions or deductions, resulting in a $6 million increase in the allowance balance from $22 million to $28 million. Combined, ABT\u2019s decrease of $64 million and AMGN\u2019s increase of $6 million result in a net decrease of $58 million in the total allowance, but since the question asks for the total change (absolute movement), the sum is $64 million (ABT) + $6 million (AMGN) = $70 million total change, offsetting to a net $58 million decrease.",

      "question": "How does Abbott's 19.4% Medical Devices segment sales growth in 2021, driven by double-digit expansion in Structural Heart and Electrophysiology, position it competitively against Medtronic's specific Structural Heart & Aortic product portfolio offerings?",
      "answer": "Abbott's Medical Devices segment achieved 19.4% sales growth in 2021, with Structural Heart being one of the key drivers contributing to this growth. This indicates strong market traction for Abbott's Structural Heart solutions despite the lingering effects of the pandemic. Meanwhile, Medtronic's Structural Heart & Aortic division offers a comprehensive portfolio including transcatheter aortic valve replacement systems (Evolut R, Evolut PRO, and Evolut PRO+), surgical valve replacement and repair products, and endovascular stent grafts such as the Endurant II and Valiant Captivia systems. Abbott's growth suggests increasing competitiveness in this space, especially as its Structural Heart division recovered from pandemic-related procedure volume declines in 2020, while Medtronic maintains an established presence with a broad range of structural heart and aortic disease treatment options.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Abbott's Medical Devices segment achieved 19.4% sales growth in 2021, driven by double-digit growth in Structural Heart and Electrophysiology divisions.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Abbott's strong 2021 growth in Structural Heart indicates rising competitiveness against Medtronic, which already has an extensive Structural Heart & Aortic portfolio with multiple established product lines targeting aortic valve disorders and aortic disease."

          "chunk_text": "The  extent  of  the  impact  and  the  timing  of  a  recovery  in  the  number  of  procedures  and  routine  testing  in  a particular country or geographic region depended upon the progression of COVID-19 cases in that country or region as well as the actions taken by the government in that country related to COVID-19.  In 2020, the recovery in procedures and routine testing volumes in China began in March 2020.  In other parts of the world, such as the U.S. and Europe, volumes improved across Abbott's hospital-based businesses as the second quarter progressed and the improvement continued  in  the  third  quarter.    However,  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020,  the  improving  trends  in  the  demand  for procedures and routine testing flattened or were negatively impacted depending upon the business and the region as many countries, including the U.S., experienced an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations.\n\nWhile  routine  diagnostic  testing  and  cardiovascular  and  neuromodulation  procedure  volumes  were  negatively impacted early in 2021 by elevated COVID-19 case rates, overall volumes improved over the course of the year until the latter part of 2021 when demand softened in several geographies with the emergence of another variant.\n\nWhile Abbott's branded generic pharmaceuticals business was also negatively affected by the pandemic in 2020 as COVID-19 spread across emerging market countries in the second and third quarters of 2020, volumes recovered and grew in 2021. Abbott's nutritional and diabetes care businesses were the least affected by the pandemic as is further discussed below.\n\nAbbott is continually monitoring the effects of the pandemic on its operations. Throughout the pandemic, Abbott has continued to ensure that its operations throughout the world are aligned with the specific governmental orders and guidelines affecting each location. Abbott has taken aggressive steps to limit exposure to COVID-19 and enhance the safety of facilities for its employees.\n\nThe demand for COVID-19 tests has been highly volatile. Abbott expects this volatility to continue as the possible emergence and severity of new variants are unpredictable. Due to the unpredictability of the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the  extent  to  which  the  pandemic  will  have  a  material  effect  on Abbott's  business,  financial condition or results of operations is uncertain.\n\nWhile Abbott's 2021 and 2020 sales were most significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the increase in total sales over the last three years also reflects the introduction of new products across various businesses as well as higher sales of various existing products. Sales in emerging markets, which represent approximately 35 percent of total company sales,  increased  19.6  percent  in  2021  and  2.0  percent  in  2020,  excluding  the  impact  of  foreign  exchange. (Emerging markets include all countries except the United States, Western Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.)\n\nOver the last three years, Abbott's operating margin as a percentage of sales increased from 14.2 percent in 2019 to 15.5 percent in 2020 and 19.6 percent in 2021.  The increase in 2021 from 2020 reflects the impact of sales volume increases for COVID-19 tests in Rapid Diagnostics and growth across virtually all of Abbott's businesses due, in part, to recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the impact of inflation and supply chain challenges on various manufacturing inputs and transportation costs, an increase in restructuring costs, and the unfavorable effect of foreign  exchange.    The  increase  in  2020  reflects  the  sales  volume  increases  in  the  rapid  and  molecular  diagnostics businesses, partially offset by lower Medical Devices sales due to the impact of the pandemic and the unfavorable effect of  foreign  exchange.    In  addition,  a  reduction  in  the  costs  associated  with  business  acquisitions  and  restructuring activities drove an improvement in operating margins from 2019 to 2020.\n\nIn  2021, Abbott experienced availability issues with some services and materials used in its products.  To date, Abbott has been able to manage the various supply chain challenges without significant supply disruption or shortage for  services,  raw  materials  and  supplies.  While  Abbott  expects  inflationary  pressures  on  various  raw  materials, packaging materials and transportation costs to continue in 2022, the impact of such cost increases is expected to be at least partially mitigated by price increases in certain businesses and the impact of continued gross margin improvement initiatives. To the extent that supply chain challenges in the industries in which Abbott operates normalize over time, this may lessen inflationary pressures.\n\nWith respect to the performance of each reportable segment over the last three years, sales in the Medical Devices segment, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, increased 19.4 percent in 2021 and decreased 3.8 percent in 2020. The sales increase in 2021 was driven by double-digit growth across all of Abbott's Medical Devices divisions, led by Diabetes  Care,  Structural  Heart  and  Electrophysiology.  The  sales  decrease  in  2020  was  driven  by  Abbott's cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses due primarily to reduced procedure volumes as a result of the COVID19 pandemic. These decreases were partially offset by double-digit growth in Diabetes Care.\n\nIn 2021, operating earnings for the Medical Devices segment increased 48.6 percent. The operating margin profile increased from 30.8 percent of sales in 2019 to 31.4 percent in 2021 primarily due to higher sales volumes in Diabetes Care and Abbott's cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses. This growth was partially offset by pricing pressures on drug eluting stents (DES) as a result of market competition in the U.S. and other major markets.",

      "answer": "Medtronic's Neuromodulation segment represented approximately 5.5% of its total revenue in 2022. Abbott does not disclose specific revenue figures for its Neuromodulation segment but highlights it as a key area of therapeutic focus with investments in next-generation technologies and digital health to treat chronic pain, movement disorders, and other indications. This suggests that while Abbott prioritizes Neuromodulation strategically, Medtronic maintains a measurable and significant presence in the segment with explicit revenue contribution disclosed.",

          "chunk_text": "In the EU, medical devices are also categorized into different classes and the regulatory process, which had been governed by the European Medical Device Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Device Directive, varies by class. In the second quarter of 2017, the EU adopted the new Medical Devices Regulation (MDR) which replaced the existing  directives  in  the  EU  for  medical  devices  and  imposes  additional  premarket  and  post-market  regulatory requirements on manufacturers of such products. The MDR applies to manufacturers as of May 26, 2021 after a fouryear transition period. Each product must bear a CE mark to show compliance with the MDR.\n\nSome  products  require  submission  of  a  design  dossier  to  the  appropriate  regulatory  authority  for  review  and approval prior to CE marking of the device. For other products, the company is required to prepare a technical file which  includes  testing  results  and  clinical  evaluations  but  can  self-certify  its  ability  to  apply  the  CE  mark  to  the product. Outside the U.S. and the EU, the regulatory requirements vary across different countries and regions.\n\nAfter approval and commercial launch of some medical devices, post-market trials may be conducted either due to a conditional requirement of the regulatory market approval or with the objective of proving product superiority.\n\nIn the Nutritional segment, the research and development process generally focuses on identifying and developing ingredients and products that address the nutritional needs of particular populations (e.g., infants and adults) or patients (e.g., people with diabetes). Depending upon the country and/or region, if claims regarding a product's efficacy will be made, clinical studies typically must be conducted.\n\nIn  the  U.S.,  the  FDA  requires  that  it  be  notified  of  proposed  new  formulations  and  formulation  or  packaging changes related to infant formula products. Prior to the launch of an infant formula or product packaging change, the company is required to obtain the FDA's confirmation that it has no objections to the proposed product or packaging. For other nutritional products, notification or pre-approval from the FDA is not required unless the product includes a new food additive. In some countries, regulatory approval may be required for certain nutritional products, including infant formula and medical nutritional products.\n\n## Areas of Focus\n\nIn 2022 and beyond, Abbott's significant areas of therapeutic focus will include the following:\n\nEstablished  Pharmaceuticals  - Abbott  focuses  on  building  country-specific  portfolios  made  up  of  high-quality medicines that meet the needs of people in emerging markets. Over the next several years, Abbott plans to expand its product  portfolio  in  key  therapeutic  areas  with  the  aim  of  being  among  the  first  to  launch  new  off-patent  and differentiated medicines. In addition, Abbott continues to expand existing brands into new markets, implement product enhancements that provide value to patients and acquire strategic products and technology through licensing activities. Abbott  is  also  actively  working  on  the  further  development  of  several  key  brands  such  as  Creon\u2122,  Duphaston\u2122, Duphalac\u2122  and  Influvac\u2122.  Depending  on  the  product,  the  activities  focus  on  development  of  new  data,  markets, formulations, delivery systems, or indications.\n\nMedical Devices - Abbott's research and development programs focus on:\n\n- Cardiac Rhythm Management - Development of next-generation rhythm management technologies, including advanced communication capabilities and leadless pacing therapies.\n- Heart  Failure  -  Continued  enhancements  to Abbott's  mechanical  circulatory  support  and  pulmonary  artery pressure systems, including enhanced clinical performance and usability.\n- Electrophysiology  -  Development  of  next-generation  technologies  in  the  areas  of  ablation,  diagnostic, mapping, and visualization and recording.\n- Vascular  -  Development  of  next-generation  technologies  for  use  in  coronary  and  peripheral  vascular procedures.\n- Structural Heart - Development of transcatheter and surgical devices for the repair and replacement of heart valves, and occlusion therapies for congenital heart defects and stroke-risk reduction.\n- Neuromodulation - Development of additional clinical evidence and next-generation technologies leveraging digital  health  to  improve  patient  and  physician  engagement  to  treat  chronic  pain,  movement  disorders  and other indications.\n- Diabetes  Care  -  Develop  enhancements  and  additional  indications  for  the  FreeStyle  Libre  platform  of continuous glucose monitoring products to help patients improve their ability to manage diabetes and for use beyond diabetes.",

For Medtronic, the difference is 7.4% (23.4% GAAP - 16.0% Non-GAAP), primarily driven by restructuring costs, acquisition-related items, and certain tax adjustments. For Pfizer, the difference is 9.0% [(105.4% GAAP - 9.0% Non-GAAP) / 10], mainly due to acquisition-related charges, legal matters, and restructuring costs.

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2023, MDT reported $4 million in 'Other Investing Activities, Net,' while PFE reported $(179) million for the same metric. For MDT, this represents a negligible portion of its total net cash used in investing activities of $(3,493) million, suggesting minimal impact. For PFE, the $(179) million in 'Other Investing Activities, Net' is a small but more noticeable component of its total net cash used in investing activities of $(32,278) million, indicating a relatively minor but more impactful role in its overall investing cash flow.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - MDT's 'Other Investing Activities, Net' for 2023 is $4 million, and its total net cash used in investing activities is $(3,493) million.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Comparing the absolute values and relative proportions shows that 'Other Investing Activities, Net' plays a minimal role for both companies, but slightly more so for PFE in the context of its larger investing cash flow base."

For JNJ, reimbursement rates are a key factor in its competitiveness, as the company competes on the basis of cost-effectiveness and reimbursement rate. If reimbursement rates decline or fail to reflect the value of JNJ's products, it could negatively impact sales and earnings, especially for its Innovative Medicine business, which is particularly sensitive to such changes. Together, this highlights how both companies are financially exposed to shifts in reimbursement policies, though through different mechanisms\u2014CVS through geographic and customer concentration, and JNJ through product market competitiveness.",

      "answer": "CVS reported an amortization of net actuarial loss of $1 million in 2023, indicating minimal ongoing impact from past actuarial losses. In contrast, JNJ reported an amortization of net actuarial loss of $199 million for the same year, reflecting a significant ongoing cost related to its retirement plans. The difference between these amounts is $198 million, highlighting a stark contrast in how each company is managing or affected by actuarial losses in their retirement obligations.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - CVS's 2023 amortization of net actuarial loss is $1 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - JNJ's 2023 amortization of net actuarial loss is $199 million.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the difference - $199 million (JNJ) - $1 million (CVS) = $198 million.",
        "Step 4: Interpret the financial implications - The large difference suggests divergent experiences with pension plan funding and actuarial assumptions."

          "chunk_text": "## ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nWe are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into various types of foreign currency derivative hedging transactions, follow investment guidelines and monitor outstanding receivables as part of our risk management program.\n\n## Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\n\nWe have operations in more than 35 countries worldwide. As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products. Our operating results are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and various foreign currencies, the most significant of which is the Euro. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these currencies, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens against these currencies, the relative value of such sales increases. Overall, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, we benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar.\n\nApproximately 27% of our product sales were denominated in foreign currencies during 2024. To partially mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on net cash flows from our foreign currency denominated sales, we enter into foreign currency exchange forward contracts. We also hedge certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a transaction is recorded and the date that cash is collected or paid. In general, the market risks of these contracts are offset by corresponding gains and losses on the transactions being hedged.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $2.9 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $364 million and $328 million, respectively, and if realized, would have negatively affected earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nWe occasionally invest in available-for-sale debt securities, adhering to a policy that requires us to limit invested amounts based on credit rating, maturity, industry group and investment type and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. The goals of our investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows:\n\n- safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk;\n- liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and\n- a competitive after-tax  rate of return.\n\nThe fair value of any available-for-sale debt securities is subject to change as a result of potential changes in market interest rates. However, primarily due to the typically short-term nature of our portfolio, we do not believe that future market risks, including a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in interest rates related to any securities, would have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.\n\nOur senior unsecured notes have fixed interest rates. As such, there is no financial interest rate exposure. The fair value of these senior unsecured notes and our liability related to future royalties as part of our 2020 acquisition of Immunomedics, Inc. are ex posed to fluctuations in interest rates. The current fair value of our debt portfolio and liability related to future royalties are $23.3 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively. The fair value will decrease as interest rates increase. The fair value will increase as interest rates decrease. Additionally, we have a $2.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility that matures in June 2029. Loans under our revolving credit facility bear interest at either (i) Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus the Applicable Percentage, (ii) the Alternative Currency Term Rate plus the Applicable Percentage, or (iii) the Base Rate plus the Applicable Percentage, each as defined in the revolving credit facility agreement. There were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2024. As such, there is currently no financial interest rate ex posure.\n\n## Equity Price Risk\n\nWe hold shares of common stock of certain publicly traded biotechnology companies primarily in connection with license and collaboration agreements. These equity securities are measured at fair value with any changes in fair value recognized in earnings.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Gilead\u2019s royalty revenue is not recognized until third-party sales occur, meaning it does not contribute to an upfront net product revenue figure. Eli Lilly deducts expected returns (less than 1% of U.S. revenue) to determine net product revenue. Therefore, the only quantifiable impact on net product revenue across both companies is the less-than-1% reduction from Eli Lilly\u2019s returns."

          "chunk_text": "## Revenue Recognition\n\n## Product Sales\n\nWe recognize revenue from product sales when control of the product transfers to the customer, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, or in certain cases, upon the corresponding sales by our customer to a third party. Revenues are recognized net of estimated rebates and chargebacks, patient co-pay assistance, prompt pay discounts, distributor fees, sales return provisions and other related deductions. These deductions to product sales are referred to as gross-to-net deductions and are estimated and recorded in the period in which the related product sales occur. Our payment terms to customers generally range from 30 to 90 days; however, payment terms differ by jurisdiction, by customer and, in some instances, by type of product. Revenues from product sales, net of gross-to-net deductions, are recorded only to the extent a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized is not probable of occurring when the uncertainty associated with gross-to-net deductions is subsequently resolved. Taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from customers are excluded from product sales. If we expect, at contract inception, that the period between the transfer of control and corresponding payment from the customer will be one year or less,  we  do  not  adjust  the  amount  of  consideration  for  the  effects  of  a  financing  component.  Shipping  and  handling  activities  are  considered  to  be  fulfillment activities and not a separate performance obligation.\n\n## Gross-to-Net Deductions\n\n## Rebates and Chargebacks\n\nRebates and chargebacks are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements and include amounts due to payers and healthcare providers under various programs. These amounts may vary by product, payer and individual plans. Providers qualified under certain programs can purchase our products through wholesalers or other distributors at a discount. The wholesalers or distributors then charge the discount back to us.\n\nRebates and chargebacks are estimated primarily based on product sales, including product mix and pricing, historical and estimated payer mix and discount rates, among other inputs, which require significant estimates and judgment. We assess and update our estimates each reporting period to reflect actual claims and other current information.\n\nChargebacks that are payable to our direct customers are generally classified as reductions of Accounts receivable on our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets. Rebates that are payable to third party payers and healthcare providers are recorded in Accrued rebates on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Patient Co-Pay Assistance\n\nCo-pay assistance represents financial assistance to qualified patients, assisting them with prescription drug co-payments required by insurance. Our accrual for co-pay is based on an estimate of claims and the cost per claim that we expect to receive associated with inventory that exists in the distribution channel at period end.\n\n## Cash Discounts\n\nWe estimate  cash  discounts  based  on  contractual  terms,  historical  customer  payment  patterns  and  our  ex pectations  regarding  future  customer  payment patterns.\n\n## Distributor Fees\n\nUnder  our  inventory  management  agreements  with  our  significant  U.S.  wholesalers,  we  pay  the  wholesalers  a  fee  primarily  for  compliance  with  certain contractually-determined covenants such as the maintenance of agreed-upon inventory levels. These distributor fees are based on a contractually-determined fixed percentage of sales.\n\n## Allowance for Sales Returns\n\nAllowances are made for estimated sales returns by our customers and are recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized. We typically permit returns if the product is damaged, defective, or otherwise cannot be used by the customer. In the U.S., we typically permit returns six months prior to and up to one year after the product expiration date. Outside the U.S., returns are only allowed in certain countries on a limited basis.\n\nOur estimates of sales returns are based primarily on analysis of our historical product return patterns, industry information reporting the return rates for similar products and contractual agreement terms. We also take into consideration known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product.\n\n## Royalty, Contract and Other Revenues\n\nRoyalty revenue is recognized in the period in which the obligation is satisfied and the corresponding sales by our corporate partners occur. Contract and other revenues are recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied.",

          "chunk_text": "## Sales Returns - Background and Uncertainties\n\n- When product sales occur, to determine the appropriate transaction price for our sales, we estimate a reserv e for future product returns related to those sales using an expected v alue approach. This estimate is based on sev eral factors, including: historical return rates, expiration date by product (on av erage, approximately 24 months after the initial sale of a product to our customer), and estimated lev els of inv entory in the wholesale and retail channels, as well as any other specifically identified anticipated returns due to known factors such as the loss of patent exclusiv ity, product recalls and discontinuations, or a changing competitiv e env ironment. We maintain a returns policy that allows most U.S. customers to return most of our products for dating issues within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the product's expiration date. Following the loss of exclusiv ity for a patent-dependent product, we expect to experience an elev ated lev el of product returns as product inv entory remaining in the wholesale and retail channels expires. Adjustments to the returns reserv e hav e been and may in the future be required based on rev ised estimates to our assumptions. We record the return amounts as a deduction to arriv e at our net product rev enue. Once the product is returned, it is destroyed; we do not record a right of return asset. Our returns policies outside the U.S. are generally more restrictiv e than in the U.S. as returns are not allowed for reasons other than failure to meet product specifications in many countries. Our reserv e for future product returns for product sales outside the U.S. is not material.\n- As a part of our process to estimate a reserv e for product returns, we regularly rev iew the supply lev els of our significant products at the major wholesalers in the U.S. and in major markets outside the U.S., primarily by rev iewing periodic inv entory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and av ailable prescription v olume information for our products, or alternativ e approaches. We attempt to maintain U.S. wholesaler inv entory lev els at an av erage of approximately one month or less. Causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated product-supply issues, weather patterns, anticipated changes in the transportation network, redundant holiday stocking, and changes in wholesaler business operations. In the U.S., the current structure of our arrangements prov ides us with data on inv entory lev els at our wholesalers; howev er, our data on inv entory lev els in the retail channel is more limited. Wholesaler stocking and destocking activ ity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns.\n- Actual U.S. product returns hav e been less than 1 percent of our U.S. rev enue during each of the past three years and hav e not fluctuated significantly as a percentage of rev enue, although fluctuations are more likely in periods following loss of patent exclusiv ity for major products in the U.S. market.\n\n## Adjustments to Revenue\n\nAdjustments to rev enue recognized as a result of changes in estimates for our most significant U.S. sales returns, rebates, and discounts liability balances for products shipped in prev ious periods were less than 3 percent of U.S. rev enue during the year ended December 31, 2024, and less than 1 percent of U.S. rev enue during each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## Collaboration and Other Arrangements\n\nWe recognize several types of rev enue from our collaborations and other arrangements, which we discuss in general terms immediately below and more specifically in Note 4 for each of our significant collaborations and other arrangements. Our collaborations and other arrangements are ev aluated to determine if the arrangements in their entirety, or contain aspects that, are contracts with customers.\n\n- Revenue related to products we sell pursuant to these arrangements is included in net product rev enue at the earlier of when control of the asset transfers to the other party or when the product has no alternativ e use to us and we hav e right to payment.\n- Profit-sharing due from our collaboration partners, which is based upon gross margins reported to us by our partners, is recognized as collaboration and other rev enue as earned.\n- Royalty rev enue from licensees and certain of our collaboration partners, which is based on sales to third parties of licensed products and technology, is recorded when the third-party sale occurs and the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied).

In contrast, Eli Lilly (LLY) faces civil monetary penalties stemming from non-compliance with the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), particularly its new manufacturer discount program under Medicare Part D, which begins in 2025. The IRA-mandated penalties could significantly affect LLY\u2019s revenue, especially for products like Jardiance, which is subject to a 66% discount under the government price-setting mechanism starting in 2026. While both companies face civil monetary penalties, GILD\u2019s exposure is rooted in regulatory compliance and product safety, whereas LLY\u2019s is tied to legislative reforms impacting pricing and reimbursement, with direct financial consequences from mandated discounts and rebate obligations.",

We have incurred, and will continue to incur, inventory write-off charges and other expenses for products that fail to meet specifications and quality standards as well as changes we may adopt in our manufacturing strategy, and we may need to undertake costly remediation efforts or seek more costly manufacturing alternatives. Such developments could increase our manufacturing costs, cause us to lose revenues or market share and damage our reputation. Our business may be adversely affected if approval of any of our product candidates were delayed or if production of our products were interrupted.\n\n## Regulatory and Other Legal Risks\n\nOur operations depend on compliance with complex FDA and comparable international regulations. Failure to obtain broad approvals on a timely basis or to maintain compliance, including if significant safety issues arise for our marketed products or our product candidates, could delay or halt commercialization of our products.\n\nThe products we develop must be approved for marketing and sale by regulatory authorities and, once approved, are subject to extensive regulation by FDA, EMA and comparable regulatory agencies in other countries. We have filed, and anticipate that we will continue to file, for marketing approval in additional countries and for additional indications and products. These and any future marketing applications we file may not be approved by the regulatory authorities on a timely basis, or at all.  For  ex ample,  in  October  2022,  we  announced that  FDA issued a complete response letter for our  Biologics  License Application for bulevirtide for the treatment of adults with hepatitis delta virus infection. Even if marketing approval is granted for our product candidates, there may be significant limitations on their use. We cannot state with certainty when or whether any of our product candidates under development will be approved or launched; whether we will be able to develop, license or acquire additional product candidates or products; or whether any products, once launched, will be commercially successful.\n\nFurther, how we manufacture and sell our products is subject to extensive regulation and review. For example, under FDA rules, we are often required to conduct post-approval clinical studies to assess a known serious risk, signals of serious risk or to identify an unexpected serious risk. In certain circumstances, we may be required to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program for our products, which could include a medication guide, patient package insert, a communication plan to healthcare providers, restrictions on distribution or use of a product and other elements FDA deems necessary to assure safe use of the drug. Discovery of previously unknown problems with our marketed products or product candidates, including serious safety, resistance or drug interaction issues, or problems with our manufacturing, safety reporting or promotional activities, may result in regulatory approvals being delayed, denied or granted with significant restrictions on our products, including limitations on or the withdrawal of the products from the market.\n\nAs additional studies are conducted after obtaining marketing approval for our products, and as our products are used over longer periods of time by many patients, including patients with underlying health problems or those taking other medicines, we expect to continue finding new issues related to safety, resistance or drug interactions. Any such issues may require changes to our product labels, such as additional warnings, contraindications or even narrowed indications, or the halt of product sales.\n\nRegulatory  authorities  have  been  moving  towards  more  active  and  transparent  pharmacovigilance  and  are  making  greater  amounts  of  stand-alone  safety information  and  clinical  trial  data  directly  available  to  the  public  through  websites  and  other  means,  such  as  periodic  safety  update  report  summaries,  risk management plan summaries and various adverse event data.

          "chunk_text": "## Trends Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access and Certain Other Regulatory Developments\n\nReforms, including those that may stem from political initiativ es, periods of unev en economic growth or downturns, or as a result of inflation or deflation, the emergence or escalation of, and responses to, international tension and conflicts, or gov ernment budgeting priorities, are expected to continue to result in added pressure on pricing and reimbursement for our products.\n\nGlobal concern ov er access to, and affordability of, pharmaceutical products continues to driv e regulatory and legislativ e debate and action, as well as cost containment efforts by gov ernmental authorities. Such measures include the use of mandated discounts, price reporting requirements, mandated reference prices, restrictiv e formularies, changes to av ailable intellectual property protections, as well as other efforts. In 2022, the U.S. gov ernment enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). Among other measures, the IRA requires the U.S. Department of Health and Human Serv ices (HHS) to effectiv ely set prices for certain single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D. Generally, these gov ernment prices apply beginning at nine years (for medicines approv ed under a New Drug Application) or thirteen years (for medicines approv ed under a Biologics License Application) following FDA approv al or licensure for the molecule and are set at a price that generally represents a significant discount from existing prices to wholesalers and direct purchasers. While the law specifies a maximum price that HHS can set, it does not set a minimum price. The Medicare price HHS determines may impact the product's best price determination under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and the 340B Drug Pricing Program, potentially leading to a negativ e impact on both Medicaid and 340B prices. In August 2023, HHS selected Jardiance, which is part of our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, as one of the first ten medicines subject to gov ernment-set prices effectiv e in 2026. In August 2024, HHS announced the government-set prices for these medicines with Jardiance subject to a 66% discount compared to the 2023 U.S. calendar year list price for a 30-day supply and discounts for the other nine medicines ranging from approximately 38% to 79% below list price. Giv en our product portfolio, we expect additional significant products will be selected in future years, which would hav e the effect of accelerating rev enue erosion prior to expiry of exclusiv ities. The effect of reducing prices and reimbursement for certain of our products could significantly impact our business and consolidated results of operations.\n\nOther IRA prov isions require drug manufacturers to prov ide rebates for Medicare Part B and Part D medicines under certain circumstances. Also, on January 1, 2025, the Part D benefit redesign replaced the Part D Cov erage Gap Discount Program with a new manufacturer discount program. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to v arious penalties, including civ il monetary penalties, which could be significant.\n\nThe IRA has, and will continue to, meaningfully influence our business strategies and those of our competitors. In particular, the nine-year timeline to set prices for medicines approv ed under a New Drug Application reduces the attractiv eness of inv estment in small molecule innov ation. The IRA can cause changes to dev elopment approach and timing and inv estments at-risk. The full impact of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry, including the implications to us of a competitor's product being selected for price setting, remains uncertain.\n\nAdditional policies, regulations, legislation, or enforcement, including those proposed or pursued by lawmakers, regulators, and other authorities in the U.S. and worldwide, could adv ersely impact our business and consolidated results of operations. For example, the U.S. House of Representativ es recently passed the BIOSECURE Act, which is under consideration in the U.S. Senate. This legislation, if passed, could affect elements of the pharmaceutical supply chain; although as currently drafted we do not anticipate the bill would hav e a material impact on our business.",

In contrast, Abbott Laboratories generally expensed IPR&D costs as incurred unless the project had an alternative future use.

          "chunk_text": "## Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n\n## Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\n\nRESEARCH  AND  DEVELOPMENT  COSTS  -  Internal  research  and  development  costs  are  expensed  as incurred.  Clinical  trial  costs  incurred  by  third  parties  are  expensed  as  the  contracted  work  is  performed.  Where contingent milestone payments are due to third parties under research and development arrangements, the milestone payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved.\n\nACQUIRED IN-PROCESS AND COLLABORATIONS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (IPR&amp;D) - The initial costs of rights to IPR&amp;D projects obtained in an asset acquisition are expensed as IPR&amp;D unless the project has an alternative future use. These costs include initial payments incurred prior to regulatory approval in connection with research  and  development  collaboration  agreements  that  provide  rights  to  develop,  manufacture,  market  and/or  sell pharmaceutical or medical device products. The fair value of IPR&amp;D projects acquired in a business combination are capitalized  and  accounted  for  as  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  until  completed  and  are  then  amortized  over  the remaining useful life. Collaborations are not significant.\n\nCONCENTRATION OF RISK AND GUARANTEES - Due to the nature of its operations, Abbott is not subject to  significant  concentration  risks  relating  to  customers,  products  or  geographic  locations.  Product  warranties  are  not significant.\n\nAbbott has no material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements; no special purpose entities; nor activities that include non-exchange-traded contracts accounted for at fair value. Abbott periodically acquires a business or product rights  in  which Abbott  agrees  to  pay  contingent  consideration  based  on  attaining  certain  thresholds  or  based  on  the occurrence of certain events.\n\n## Note 2 - New Accounting Standards\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn  June  2016,  the  FASB  issued Accounting  Standards  Update  (ASU)  2016-13, Financial  Instruments  -  Credit Losses ,  which  changes  the  methodology  to  be  used  to  measure  credit  losses  for  certain  financial  instruments  and financial assets, including trade receivables. The new methodology requires the recognition of an allowance that reflects the  current  estimate  of  credit  losses  expected  to  be  incurred  over  the  life  of  the  financial  asset. Abbott  adopted  the standard on January 1, 2020 and recorded a cumulative adjustment that was not significant to Earnings employed in the business in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nIn  December  2019,  the  FASB  issued ASU  2019-12, Income  Taxes  (Topic  740):  Simplifying  the  Accounting  for Income Taxes , which among other things, eliminates certain exceptions in the current rules regarding the approach for intraperiod  tax  allocations  and  the  methodology  for  calculating  income  taxes  in  an  interim  period,  and  clarifies  the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2021. The new standard did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Note 3 - Revenue\n\nAbbott's  revenues  are  derived  primarily  from  the  sale  of  a  broad  line  of  health  care  products  under  short-term receivable  arrangements.  Patent  protection  and  licenses,  technological  and  performance  features,  and  inclusion  of Abbott's products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. Abbott's products are generally sold directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, health care facilities, laboratories, physicians' offices and government agencies throughout the world. Abbott has four reportable segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices.",

          "chunk_text": "The eventual realized value of the acquired IPR&amp;D project may vary from its fair value at the date of acquisition. If the carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to write down the intangible asset to its estimated fair value. For example, in 2019, we recognized an $800 million impairment charge related to IPR&amp;D projects primarily for the treatment of indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma due to changes in estimated market opportunities. A high rate of failure is inherent in the discovery and development of new products.\n\nIntangible assets are also periodically reviewed for changes in facts or circumstances resulting in a reduction to the estimated useful life of the asset, requiring the acceleration of amortization.\n\nSee Note 9. Goodwill and Intangible Assets of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Legal Contingencies\n\nWe  are  a  party  to  various  legal  actions.  The  most  significant  of  these  are  described  in  Note  14.  Commitments  and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. It is not possible to determine the outcome of these matters. We recognize accruals for such actions to the extent that we conclude that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. We accrue for the best estimate of a loss within a range; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, then we accrue the minimum amount in the range. If we determine that a material loss is reasonably possible, we disclose the possible loss or range of loss, or that the amount of loss cannot be estimated at this time.\n\nSignificant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of the inherent uncertainty and unpredictability related to these matters, accruals are based on what we believe to be the best information available at the time of our assessment, including the legal facts and circumstances of the case,  status  of  the  proceedings,  applicable  law  and  the  views  of  legal  counsel.  Upon  the  final  resolution  of  such  matters,  it  is possible that there may be a loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. We periodically reassess these matters when additional information becomes available and adjust our estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances indicate the need for any changes. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded an accrual of $1.25 billion in Accrued and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for  the  settlement  related  to  bictegravir  litigation.  See  Note  14.  Commitments  and  Contingencies  of  the  Notes  to  Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe  estimate  our  income  tax  provision,  including  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities,  based  on  significant  management judgment. We evaluate the realization of our deferred tax assets each reporting period. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made.\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland. Due to economic and political conditions, various countries are actively considering or have made changes to existing tax laws. We cannot predict the form or timing of potential legislative changes that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.\n\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained  upon  examination  by  tax  authorities  based  on  the  technical  merits  of  the  position.  The  tax  benefit  recognized  in  the Consolidated Financial Statements for a particular tax position is based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits ('UTB') is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as  significant  amendments  to  existing  tax  law,  new  regulations  or  interpretations  by  tax  authorities,  new  information  obtained during a tax examination or resolution of an examination. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTB in Income tax (expense) benefit on our Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n## RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\nThere have been no new accounting pronouncements issued nor adopted during the year ended December 31, 2021 that are of significance to us.",

      "answer": "The total amount of acquired IPR&D expenses for both companies in 2022 is $1,035 million. Abbott Laboratories expensed $500 million for IPR&D projects acquired directly in transactions other than business combinations that lack alternative future use, and Gilead Sciences reported $535 million in acquired IPR&D expenses, which includes initial costs of externally developed IPR&D projects without alternative future use.",

          "chunk_text": "## Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n\n## Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\n\nRESEARCH  AND  DEVELOPMENT  COSTS  -  Internal  research  and  development  costs  are  expensed  as incurred.  Clinical  trial  costs  incurred  by  third  parties  are  expensed  as  the  contracted  work  is  performed.  Where contingent milestone payments are due to third parties under research and development arrangements, the milestone payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved.\n\nACQUIRED IN-PROCESS AND COLLABORATIONS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (IPR&amp;D) - The initial costs of rights to IPR&amp;D projects obtained in an asset acquisition are expensed as IPR&amp;D unless the project has an alternative future use. These costs include initial payments incurred prior to regulatory approval in connection with research  and  development  collaboration  agreements  that  provide  rights  to  develop,  manufacture,  market  and/or  sell pharmaceutical or medical device products. The fair value of IPR&amp;D projects acquired in a business combination are capitalized  and  accounted  for  as  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  until  completed  and  are  then  amortized  over  the remaining useful life. Collaborations are not significant.\n\nCONCENTRATION OF RISK AND GUARANTEES - Due to the nature of its operations, Abbott is not subject to  significant  concentration  risks  relating  to  customers,  products  or  geographic  locations.  Product  warranties  are  not significant.\n\nAbbott has no material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements; no special purpose entities; nor activities that include non-exchange-traded contracts accounted for at fair value. Abbott periodically acquires a business or product rights  in  which Abbott  agrees  to  pay  contingent  consideration  based  on  attaining  certain  thresholds  or  based  on  the occurrence of certain events.\n\n## Note 2 - New Accounting Standards\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn  June  2016,  the  FASB  issued Accounting  Standards  Update  (ASU)  2016-13, Financial  Instruments  -  Credit Losses ,  which  changes  the  methodology  to  be  used  to  measure  credit  losses  for  certain  financial  instruments  and financial assets, including trade receivables. The new methodology requires the recognition of an allowance that reflects the  current  estimate  of  credit  losses  expected  to  be  incurred  over  the  life  of  the  financial  asset. Abbott  adopted  the standard on January 1, 2020 and recorded a cumulative adjustment that was not significant to Earnings employed in the business in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nIn  December  2019,  the  FASB  issued ASU  2019-12, Income  Taxes  (Topic  740):  Simplifying  the  Accounting  for Income Taxes , which among other things, eliminates certain exceptions in the current rules regarding the approach for intraperiod  tax  allocations  and  the  methodology  for  calculating  income  taxes  in  an  interim  period,  and  clarifies  the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2021. The new standard did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Note 3 - Revenue\n\nAbbott's  revenues  are  derived  primarily  from  the  sale  of  a  broad  line  of  health  care  products  under  short-term receivable  arrangements.  Patent  protection  and  licenses,  technological  and  performance  features,  and  inclusion  of Abbott's products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. Abbott's products are generally sold directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, health care facilities, laboratories, physicians' offices and government agencies throughout the world. Abbott has four reportable segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices.",

          "chunk_text": "## Research and Development Expenses\n\nR&amp;D expenses consist primarily of clinical studies performed by contract research organizations ('CROs'), materials and supplies,  payments  under  collaborative  and  other  arrangements  including  milestone  payments,  licenses  and  fees,  expense reimbursements to the collaboration partners, personnel costs including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, and  overhead  allocations  consisting  of  various  support  and  infrastructure  costs.  Milestone  payments  made  to  third-party collaborators are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Milestone payments made upon regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. From time to time, we enter into development and  collaboration  agreements  in  which  we  share  expenses  with  a  collaborative  partner. We  record  payments  received  from  our collaborative partners for their share of the development costs as a reduction of R&amp;D expenses.\n\nWe  charge  R&amp;D  costs,  including  clinical  study  costs,  to  expense  when  incurred.  Clinical  study  costs  are  a  significant component of R&amp;D expenses. Most of our clinical studies are performed by third-party CROs. We monitor levels of performance under each significant contract including the extent of patient enrollment and other activities through communications with our CROs. We accrue costs for clinical studies performed by CROs over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjust our estimates, if required, based upon our ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred by the CROs. All of our material CRO contracts are terminable by us upon written notice and we are generally only liable for actual services completed by the CRO and certain non-cancelable expenses incurred at any point of termination. Payments we make for R&amp;D services prior to the services being rendered are recorded as prepaid assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are expensed as the services are provided.\n\n## Acquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses\n\nAcquired IPR&amp;D expenses reflect IPR&amp;D impairments as well as the initial costs of externally developed IPR&amp;D projects, acquired directly in a transaction other than a business combination, that do not have an alternative future use, including upfront payments related to various collaborations and the initial costs of rights to IPR&amp;D projects. The acquired IPR&amp;D is expensed on acquisition  date.  Future  costs  to  develop  these  IPR&amp;D  projects  are  recorded  in  Research  and  development  expenses  on  our Consolidated Statements of Income as incurred.\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\nSelling, general and administrative ('SG&amp;A') expenses relate to sales and marketing, finance, human resources, legal and other  administrative  activities.  SG&amp;A  expenses  consist  primarily  of  personnel  costs,  facilities  and  overhead  costs,  outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses, and other general and administrative costs. SG&amp;A expenses also include the Branded Prescription Drug ('BPD') fee. In the United States, we, along with other pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded drug products, are  required  to  pay  a  portion  of  the  BPD  fee,  which  is  estimated  based  on  select  government  sales  during  the  prior  year  as  a percentage of total industry government sales.\n\nWe expense the costs of advertising, including promotional expenses, as incurred. Advertising expenses were $735 million, $795 million and $784 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nWe consider highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and an original maturity of three months or less on the purchase date to be cash equivalents.\n\n## Marketable and Non-Marketable Securities\n\n## Marketable Debt Securities\n\nWe determine the appropriate classification of our marketable debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation  at  each  balance  sheet  date.  All  of  our  marketable  debt  securities  are  considered  available-for-sale  and  carried  at estimated  fair  values  and  reported  in  cash  equivalents,  short-term  marketable  debt  securities  or  long-term  marketable  debt securities.  Unrealized  gains  and  losses  on  available-for-sale  debt  securities  are  excluded  from  net  income  and  reported  in Accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  ('AOCI')  as  a  separate  component  of  stockholders'  equity.  Other  income (expense), net, includes interest, amortization of purchase premiums and discounts, realized gains and losses on sales of securities and expected credit losses, if any. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. We regularly review our investments for declines in fair value below their amortized cost basis to determine whether the impairment is due to credit-related factors or noncredit-related factors. Our review includes the creditworthiness of the security issuers, the severity of the unrealized losses, whether we have the intent to sell the securities and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities before the recovery of their amortized cost bases. When we determine that a portion of the unrealized loss is due to an expected credit loss, we recognize the loss amount in Other income (expense), net, with a corresponding allowance against the carrying value of the security we hold. The portion of the unrealized loss related to factors other than credit losses is recognized in AOCI.",

      "answer": "Merck's supply constraints for ProQuad and Gardasil vaccines, along with the 3% decline in global Gardasil sales due to reduced demand in China, could lead to lower vaccination rates, potentially increasing the incidence of preventable diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella, and HPV-related conditions. This, in turn, may result in higher utilization of medical services and increased claims costs for health insurers like CVS. However, CVS has stated in its 10-K that it faces limitations in detecting, forecasting, and pricing for medical cost trends, especially during periods of significant volatility in utilization and costs. The ACA and other regulations further restrict CVS's ability to adjust pricing based on these increased costs. Therefore, the combination of Merck's supply and demand issues and CVS's forecasting and pricing constraints could amplify volatility in CVS's medical cost trends, limiting its ability to take timely corrective actions and negatively impacting its operating results.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source B - Merck experienced supply constraints for ProQuad and a 3% decline in Gardasil sales globally, primarily due to lower demand in China.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - A decline in vaccine availability or demand could lead to increased disease incidence and higher medical utilization, which would increase claims costs for insurers like CVS. However, CVS explicitly stated it struggles to forecast and price for such cost increases, particularly during volatile periods. This creates a multi-hop causal chain where Merck's vaccine supply and demand issues could indirectly affect CVS's ability to manage and price for rising medical costs, ultimately impacting its profitability."

Outside of China, Gardasil/Gardasil 9 achieved strong growth in most other international markets due to higher demand, particularly in Japan due to a national catch-up immunization program, and in the U.S. due to public sector buying patterns, higher pricing and demand. Beginning in mid-2024, the Company observed a significant decline in shipments from its distributor and commercialization partner in China, Chongqing Zhifei Biological Products Co., Ltd. (Zhifei), to disease and control prevention institutions and correspondingly into the points of vaccination, resulting in above normal inventory levels at Zhifei. A ccordingly , the Company shipped less than its contracted doses to Zhifei in the latter part of 2024. Lower demand in China persisted and, at the end of 2024, overall channel inventory levels in China remained elevated at above normal levels. Therefore, the Company made a decision to temporarily pause shipments to China beginning in February 2025 through at least the middle of the year and, as a result, Gardasil/Gardasil 9 sales will decline significantly in 2025 compared with 2024. In January 2025, China's NM PA  approved Gardasil for use in males 9-26 years of age to help prevent certain HPV -related cancers and diseases.\n\nThe Company is a party to license agreements pursuant to which the Company pays royalties on sales of Gardasil/Gardasil 9. Under the terms of the more significant of these agreements, M erck pays a 7% royalty on sales of Gardasil/Gardasil 9 in the U.S. to one third party (this royalty expires in December 2028). M erck paid an additional 7% royalty on worldwide sales of Gardasil/Gardasil 9 to another third party; this royalty expired in December 2023. The royalty expenses are included in Cost of sales .\n\nGlobal sales of ProQuad , a pediatric combination vaccine to help protect against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, grew 6% in 2024 primarily due to higher pricing in the U.S. Worldwide sales of M-M-R II, a v accine to help protect against measles, mumps and rubella, grew 8% in 2024 primarily due to higher demand in certain international markets, partially offset by lower demand in the  U.S.  Global sales of Varivax, a  v accine  to  help  prev ent  chickenpox (varicella), grew 3% in 2024 primarily attributable to higher pricing in the U.S., partially offset by lower sales in Latin A merica due to supply constraints. The Company is experiencing manufacturing delays related to ProQuad and Varivax . A s  a  result,  the  Company  anticipates that some international markets will experience supply constraints during 2025. In order to ensure consistent supply in the U.S., in January 2025, the Company borrowed doses of ProQuad from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Pediatric V accine Stockpile. The borrowing will reduce sales of ProQuad in the first quarter of 2025 by approximately $70 million. These doses will be used to support routine vaccination in the U.S.\n\nWorldwide sales of Vaxneuvance , a v accine to help protect against invasive pneumococcal disease caused by certain serotypes, rose 22% in 2024 primarily due to continued uptake following launches in the pediatric indication in Europe, Japan, and other countries in the A sia Pacific region, partially offset by lower demand in the U.S. due to competition. M erck is a party to license agreements pursuant to which the Company pays royalties on sales of Vaxneuvance . Under the most significant of these agreements, M erck pays a royalty of 7.25% on net sales of Vaxneuvance through 2026; this royalty will decline to 2.5% on net sales from 2027 through 2035. The royalty expenses are included in Cost of sales .\n\nWorldwide sales of Pneumovax 23, a vaccine to help prevent pneumococcal disease, declined 36% in 2024 due to lower global demand, particularly in the U.S. as the market has shifted toward newer adult pneumococcal conjugate vaccines.\n\nIn June 2024, the FDA  approved Capvaxive (Pneumococcal 21-valent Conjugate V accine) for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal pneumonia caused by certain serotypes in individuals 18 years of age and older. The approval was supported by results from multiple Phase 3 clinical studies evaluating Capvaxive in both vaccine-na\u00efve and vaccine-experienced adult patient populations, including STRIDE-3, STRIDE-4, STRIDE-5 and STRIDE-6. Sales of Capvaxive were $97 million in 2024. M erck is a party to license agreements pursuant to which the Company pays royalties on sales of Capvaxive . Under the most significant of these agreements, M erck pays a royalty of 7.25% on net sales of Capvaxive through 2026; this royalty will decline to 2.5% on net sales from 2027 through 2035. The royalty expenses are included in Cost of sales .\n\n## Hospital Acute Care\n\n",

      "answer": "The 33% decline in Merck's 2024 U.S. sales of Januvia and Janumet, driven by lower pricing, competitive pressures, and Medicaid rebate changes, affects CVS's Health Care Benefits segment by potentially reducing pharmacy benefit management (PBM) service demand and increasing medical cost trends. CVS notes that adverse economic conditions, including changes in drug utilization and provider behavior, can increase its costs and limit its ability to manage medical cost trends. Lower drug utilization due to reduced prescribing of Merck's diabetes medications could decrease PBM revenue for CVS while simultaneously shifting more cost burden to medical claims if alternative treatments are more expensive, thereby increasing medical costs for CVS and straining its ability to manage benefit costs and maintain profitability.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_b - Merck's Januvia and Janumet sales declined 33% in 2024 due to lower U.S. pricing, competitive pressures, and Medicaid rebate changes.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - CVS's Health Care Benefits segment is sensitive to changes in drug utilization and provider behavior, which can increase medical costs and reduce PBM demand.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The drop in Januvia and Janumet sales volume and pricing changes likely reduce PBM service demand for CVS and may increase medical claims costs if alternative diabetes treatments are costlier, directly impacting CVS's cost management and profitability."

A s a result of this provision, the Company paid state M edicaid programs more in rebates than it received on M edicaid sales of Januvia , Janumet and Janumet XR in 2024.\n\nIn early 2025, M erck lowered the list price of the Januvia family of products to more closely align them with net prices. The lower list price will reduce the rebate amount M erck pays to M edicaid, resulting in higher realized net pricing, which will be partially offset by continuing volume declines. The Company expects higher U.S. net sales of these products in 2025 compared with 2024.\n\nWhile the key U.S. patent for Januvia , Janumet and Janumet XR claiming the sitagliptin compound expired in January 2023, as a result of favorable court rulings and settlement agreements related to a later expiring patent directed to the specific sitagliptin salt form of the products (see  Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements), the Company expects that Januvia and Janumet will not lose market exclusivity in the U.S. until M ay  2026 and Janumet XR will not lose market exclusivity in the U.S. until July 2026, although a non-automatically substitutable form of sitagliptin that differs from the form in the Company's sitagliptin products has been approved by the FDA . A dditionally , i n 2023, the U.S. Department of HHS, through the CM S, announced that Januvia would be included in the first y ear of the IRA 's Program. Pursuant to the IRA 's Program, a government price was set for Januvia , which will become effective on January 1, 2026. A lso, in January 2025, the U.S. Department of HHS, through the CM S, announced that Janumet and Janumet XR would be in included in the second year of the IRA 's Program, with government price setting to become effective on January 1, 2027. The Company has sued the U.S. government regarding the IRA 's Program (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements). A s a result of the anticipated patent expiries in 2026, the government price setting in 2026 and 2027 noted above, as well as ongoing competitive pressures, the Company anticipates significant sales declines for Januvia, Janumet and Janumet XR in the U.S. in 2026 and thereafter.\n\nThe Company lost market exclusivity for Januvia in  all  of  the  EU and for Janumet in some European countries in September 2022. Exclusivity for Janumet was lost in other European countries in A pril 2023. A ccordingly , the Company is experiencing sales declines in these markets and expects the declines to continue.

      "question": "How do GILD's rebate payment obligations in the U.S. and EU impact its net product sales, and how does this contrast with the legal risks JNJ faces related to rebate payments and contractual relationships in its HIV product line?",
      "answer": "GILD's net product sales are directly impacted by rebate payment obligations to Medicaid agencies and discounts to 340B covered entities, which significantly reduce the effective price of its products despite any list price increases. This dynamic limits the financial benefit GILD receives from price adjustments. In contrast, JNJ faces legal risks tied to rebate payments and contractual relationships, particularly in relation to its HIV products PREZISTA and INTELENCE, where it is involved in litigation alleging anti-kickback violations and off-label promotion under the False Claims Act. These legal challenges could result in financial penalties or settlements, highlighting a different type of financial exposure compared to GILD\u2019s more direct revenue limitations from rebates.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - GILD discloses that a 'significant portion of our sales... are subject to substantial discounts from their list prices, including rebates we may be required to pay to Medicaid agencies or discounts to 340B covered entities.' This directly impacts net product sales.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - JNJ discloses ongoing litigation related to its HIV products PREZISTA and INTELENCE, including allegations of anti-kickback violations and False Claims Act investigations tied to rebate payments and contractual relationships with pharmacy benefit managers.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - GILD experiences reduced net sales due to rebate obligations, while JNJ faces legal and financial risks from how it manages rebate and pricing arrangements, particularly in the context of regulatory scrutiny."

          "chunk_text": "At any point in this process, the development of a drug candidate can be stopped for a number of reasons, including safety concerns,  lack  of  treatment  benefit  or  manufacturing  issues.  We  cannot  be  certain  that  any  clinical  trials  that  we  are  currently conducting or any that we conduct in the future will be completed successfully or within any specified time period. We may choose, or  FDA  may  require  us,  to  delay  or  suspend  our  clinical  trials  at  any  time  if  it  appears  that  patients  are  being  exposed  to  an unacceptable health risk or if the drug candidate does not appear to have sufficient treatment benefit.\n\nEven  after  approving  a  drug,  FDA  may  also  require  Phase  4  non-registrational  studies  to  explore  scientific  questions  to further characterize safety and efficacy during commercial use of our drug. FDA may also require us to provide additional data or information, improve our manufacturing processes, procedures or facilities or may require extensive surveillance to monitor the safety or benefits of our product candidates if it determines that our filing does not contain adequate evidence of the safety and benefits of the drug. In addition, even if FDA approves a drug, it could limit the uses of the drug. FDA can withdraw approvals if it does not believe that we are complying with regulatory standards or if concerns about the safety or efficacy are uncovered or occur after approval.\n\nIn addition to obtaining FDA approval for each drug, we obtain FDA approval of the manufacturing facilities for any drug we sell, including those of companies who manufacture our drugs for us. All of these facilities are subject to periodic inspections by FDA. FDA must also approve foreign establishments that manufacture products to be sold in the United States and these facilities are subject to periodic regulatory inspection. Our manufacturing facilities located in California also must be licensed by the State of California in compliance with local regulatory requirements. Our manufacturing facilities in Canada, Ireland and Netherlands also must obtain local licenses and permits in compliance with local regulatory requirements.\n\nFDA may employ one of several tools to facilitate and expedite the development and review of a drug, including fast track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, accelerated approval and Priority Review designation. Fast track designation is designed  to  facilitate  the  development  and  review  of  a  drug  that  treats  a  serious  condition  and  fills  an  unmet  medical  need. Breakthrough Therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of a drug that treats a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence demonstrates substantial improvement over available therapies. Accelerated approval of a drug may be granted by FDA where the drug treats a serious condition, fills an unmet medical need and has been studied for safety and efficacy. Priority Review designation means FDA's goal is to take action on an application within six months of filing. FDA may grant  Priority  Review  designation  to  a  drug  that  would  provide  significant  improvement  in  the  safety  or  effectiveness  of  a treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious condition.\n\n## European Union Regulatory System and Approval Process\n\nIn  the  European  Union ('EU'), our products are subject to a variety of EU and EU Member State regulations governing clinical  trials,  commercial  sales  and  distribution. We  are  required  to  obtain  a  marketing  authorization  in  the  EU  before  we  can market  our  medicinal  products  on  the  relevant  market.  The  conduct  of  clinical  trials  in  the  EU  is  governed  by,  among  others, Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC and the EU (ICH) Good Clinical Practice rules. These impose legal and regulatory obligations that are similar to those provided in applicable U.S. laws. The conduct of clinical trials in the EU must be approved by the competent authorities of each EU Member States in which the clinical trials take place, and a positive opinion must be obtained from  the  relevant  Ethics  Committee  in  the  relevant  Member  State.  In  2014,  the  EU  legislator  adopted  Regulation  (EU)  No 536/2014  to  replace  Directive  2001/20/EC  and  to  introduce  a  coordinated  procedure  for  authorization  of  clinical  trials.  This Regulation entered into application in January 2022.\n\nMarketing authorization holders, manufacturers, importers, wholesalers and distributors of medicinal products placed on the market in the EU are required to comply with a number of regulatory requirements including pharmacovigilance, GMP compliance and the requirement to obtain manufacturing, import and/or distribution licenses issued by the competent authorities of the EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements may lead to the imposition of civil, criminal or administrative sanctions, including suspension of marketing or manufacturing authorizations.\n\n## Pricing and Reimbursement\n\nSuccessful commercialization of our products depends, in part, on the availability of third-party payer reimbursement for the cost of such products and related treatments and medical services in the markets where we sell our products. Government health authorities,  private  health  insurers  and  other  organizations  generally  provide  reimbursement.  In  the  United  States,  the  European Union and other significant or potentially significant markets for our products and product candidates, government authorities and third-party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services. A significant portion of our sales of the majority of our products are subject to substantial discounts from their list prices, including rebates we may be required  to  pay  to  Medicaid  agencies  or  discounts  we  may  be  required  to  pay  to  340B  covered  entities. As  a  result,  the  price increases we implement from time to time on certain products may have a limited effect on our net product sales in certain markets. In addition, standard reimbursement structures may not adequately reimburse for innovative therapies.",

The demand was issued in connection with an investigation under the False Claims Act. The Company has provided documents in response to the demand.\n\nIn July 2016, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Janssen Products LP were served with a qui tam complaint pursuant to the False Claims Act filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging the off-label promotion of two HIV products, PREZISTA  and INTELENCE , and anti-kickback violations in connection with the promotion of these products. The complaint was filed under seal in December 2012. The federal and state governments have declined to intervene, and the lawsuit is being prosecuted by the relators. The Court denied summary judgment on all claims in December 2021.

In August 2019, the United States Department of Justice notified JBI that it was closing the investigation. Subsequently, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts unsealed a qui tam False Claims Act complaint, which was served on the Company. The Department of Justice had declined to intervene in the qui tam lawsuit in August 2019. The Company filed a motion to dismiss, which was granted in part and denied in part. Discovery is underway. \u00ae \u00ae\n\nIn April and September 2017, Johnson &amp; Johnson received subpoenas from the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts seeking documents broadly relating to pharmaceutical copayment support programs for DARZALEX , OLYSIO , REMICADE , SIMPONI , STELARA  and ZYTIGA . The subpoenas also seek documents relating to Average Manufacturer Price and Best Price reporting to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services related to those products, as well as rebate payments to state Medicaid agencies. The Company has provided documents in response to the subpoenas. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\nIn June 2017, Johnson &amp; Johnson received a subpoena from the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts seeking information regarding practices pertaining to the sterilization of DePuy Synthes, Inc.(DePuy) spinal implants at three hospitals in Boston as well as interactions of employees of Company subsidiaries with physicians at these hospitals. Johnson &amp; Johnson and DePuy have produced documents in response to the subpoena and are fully cooperating with the government's investigation.\n\nIn July 2018, the Public Prosecution Service in Rio de Janeiro and representatives from the Brazilian antitrust authority CADE inspected the offices of more than 30 companies including Johnson &amp; Johnson do Brasil Ind\u00fastria e Com\u00e9rcio de Produtos para Sa\u00fade Ltda. The authorities appear to be investigating allegations of possible anti-competitive behavior and possible improper payments in the medical device industry. The Company continues to respond to inquiries regarding the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act from the United States Department of Justice and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nFrom time to time, the Company has received requests from a variety of United States Congressional Committees to produce information relevant to ongoing congressional inquiries. It is the policy of Johnson &amp; Johnson to cooperate with these inquiries by producing the requested information.\n\n## GENERAL LITIGATION\n\nIn March and April 2015, over 30 putative class action complaints were filed by contact lens patients in a number of courts around the United States against Johnson &amp; Johnson Vision Care, Inc. (JJVCI) and other contact lens manufacturers, distributors, and retailers, alleging vertical and horizontal conspiracies to fix the retail prices of contact lenses. The complaints allege that the manufacturers reached agreements with each other and certain distributors and retailers concerning the prices at which some contact lenses could be sold to consumers. The plaintiffs are seeking damages and injunctive relief. All of the class action cases were transferred to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida in June 2015. The plaintiffs filed a consolidated class action complaint in November 2015. Discovery and pre-trial motion practice are complete. Trial is scheduled to begin in March 2022.\n\nBeginning in September 2017, multiple purported class actions were filed on behalf of indirect purchasers of REMICADE against Johnson &amp; Johnson and Janssen Biotech, Inc.

      "answer": "Gilead faces the risk that U.S. sales could be adversely affected if lower-priced drugs from foreign markets, such as Canada, are imported into the U.S., especially if the FDA permits such importation. This could lead to a reduction in Gilead\u2019s sales due to price competition and product diversion. In contrast, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s U.S. Medical Devices sales increased by 14.9% in 2021, driven by a market recovery in procedural volumes post-COVID-19, indicating a positive growth dynamic in the U.S. market for medical devices, unlike the potential downward pressure Gilead faces in its pharmaceutical sales.",

          "chunk_text": "In  addition,  standard  reimbursement  structures  may  not  adequately  reimburse  for  innovative  therapies.  For  example, beginning  in  fiscal  year  2021,  CMS  established  a  new  severity-adjusted  diagnosis-related  group  ('DRG')  018  for  Medicare inpatient reimbursement of CAR T products such as Yescarta and Tecartus. While the new DRG has a significantly higher base payment amount than the prior DRG 016, the payment available may not be sufficient to reimburse some hospitals for their cost of care for patients receiving Yescarta and Tecartus. When reimbursement is not aligned well to account for treatment costs, Medicare beneficiaries may be denied access as this misalignment could impact the willingness of some hospitals to offer the therapy and of doctors to recommend the therapy. Additionally, in the EU, there are barriers to reimbursement in individual countries that could limit the uptake of Yescarta and Tecartus.\n\nIn addition, we estimate the rebates we will be required to pay in connection with sales during a particular quarter based on claims data from prior quarters. In the United States, actual rebate claims are typically made by payers one to three quarters in arrears. Actual claims and payments may vary significantly from our estimates.\n\n## We  may  experience  adverse  impacts  resulting  from  the  importation  of  our  products  from  lower  price  markets  or  the distribution of illegally diverted or counterfeit versions of our products.\n\nPrices for our products are based on local market economics and competition and sometimes differ from country to country. Our sales in countries with relatively higher prices may be reduced if products can be imported and resold into those countries from lower price markets. For example, U.S. sales could also be affected if FDA permits importation of drugs from Canada. We have entered into agreements with generic drug manufacturers as well as licensing agreements with the Medicines Patent Pool, a United Nations-backed public health organization, which allows generic drug manufacturers to manufacture generic versions of certain of our products for distribution in certain low- and middle-income countries. We may be adversely affected if any generic versions of our  products,  whether  or  not  produced  and/or  distributed  under  these  agreements,  are  exported  to  the  United  States,  Europe  or markets with higher prices.\n\nIn  the  EU,  we  are  required  to  permit  products  purchased  in  one  EU  member  state  to  be  sold  in  another  member  state. Purchases of our products in countries where our selling prices are relatively low for resale in countries in which our selling prices are  relatively  high  can  affect  the  inventory  level  held  by  our  wholesalers  and  can  cause  the  relative  sales  levels  in  the  various countries to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and not reflect the actual consumer demand in any given quarter.\n\nAdditionally, diverted products may be used in countries where they have not been approved and patients may source the diverted products outside the legitimate supply chain. These diverted products may be handled, shipped and stored inappropriately, which may affect the efficacy of the products and could harm patients and adversely impact us.\n\nWe are also aware of the existence of various suppliers around the world that source our products and generic versions of our products  without  Gilead's  authorization  and  sell  them  for  use  in  countries  where  those  products  have  not  been  approved. As  a result, patients may be at risk of taking unapproved medications that may not be what they purport to be, may not have the potency they claim to have or may contain harmful substances, which could adversely impact us.\n\nFurther, third parties have illegally distributed and sold, and may continue to illegally distribute and sell, illegally diverted and counterfeit versions of our medicines, which do not meet the rigorous quality standards of our manufacturing and supply chain. For example,  as  part  of  an  ongoing  investigation  in  coordination  with  the  U.S.  Marshals  and  local  law  enforcement,  we  recently executed  court-ordered  seizures  at  17  locations  across  eight  U.S.  states  and  seized  thousands  of  bottles  of  Gilead-labeled medication  with  counterfeit  supply  chain  documentation,  including  bottles  labeled  as  Biktarvy  and  Descovy.  Our  investigation revealed that pharmaceutical distributors that are not authorized by Gilead to sell Gilead medicine, sold to independent pharmacies nationwide, purported genuine Gilead medicine sourced from an illegal counterfeiting scheme.\n\nIllegally diverted and counterfeit medicines pose a serious risk to patient health and safety. Our actions to stop or prevent the distribution  and  sale  of  illegally  diverted  and  counterfeit  versions  of  our  medicines  around  the  world  may  be  costly  and unsuccessful, which may adversely affect our reputation and business, including our product revenues and financial results.\n\n## Product Development and Supply Chain Risks\n\n## We  face  risks  in  our  clinical  trials,  including  the  potential  for  unfavorable  results,  delays  in  anticipated  timelines  and disruption.\n\nWe are required to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of product candidates that we develop for each intended use through extensive  preclinical  studies  and  clinical  trials.  The  results  from  preclinical  and  early  clinical  studies  do  not  always  accurately predict results in later, large-scale clinical trials. Even successfully completed large-scale clinical trials may not result in marketable products.",

      "answer": "Gilead expenses milestone payments as incurred in asset acquisitions unless there is an alternative future use, while Johnson & Johnson expenses milestone payments up to regulatory approval and capitalizes them afterward. This means Gilead's income statement reflects the full cost of milestone payments immediately, whereas JNJ delays recognition until regulatory approval is obtained, thereby deferring some costs to future periods through amortization.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## Leases\n\nWe determine if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term, which is the non-cancelable period stated in the contract adjusted for any options to extend or terminate when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Rightof-use assets are adjusted for prepaid lease payments, lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred. Operating lease expense for the minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nWe account for lease and nonlease components in our lease agreements as a single lease component in determining lease assets and liabilities. In addition, we do not recognize the right-of-use assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of one year or less.\n\nAs most of  our  operating  leases  do  not  provide  an  implicit  interest  rate,  we  generally  utilize  a  collateralized  incremental borrowing rate, applied in a portfolio approach when relevant, based on the information available at the commencement date to determine the lease liability.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nWe  account  for  business  combinations  using  the  acquisition  method  of  accounting,  which  generally  requires  that  assets acquired,  including  IPR&amp;D  projects,  and  liabilities  assumed  be  recorded  at  their  fair  values  as  of  the  acquisition  date  on  our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any excess of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The determination  of  estimated  fair  value  requires  us  to  make  significant  estimates  and  assumptions.  As  a  result,  we  may  record adjustments to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed within the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Transaction costs associated with business combinations are expensed as they are incurred.\n\nWhen we determine net assets acquired do not meet the definition of a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting,  the  transaction  is  accounted  for  as  an  acquisition  of  assets  and,  therefore,  no  goodwill  is  recorded  and  contingent consideration, such as payments upon achievement of various developmental, regulatory and commercial milestones, generally is not recognized at the acquisition date. In an asset acquisition, upfront payments allocated to IPR&amp;D projects at the acquisition date and  subsequent  milestone  payments  are  expensed  as  incurred  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income  unless  there  is  an alternative future use.\n\n## Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Intangible assets are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date and may be subject to adjustment within the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date. Intangible assets related to IPR&amp;D projects are considered to be indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated R&amp;D efforts. We do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the assets are impaired.\n\nWhen development is successfully completed, which generally occurs when regulatory approval is obtained, the associated assets are deemed finite-lived and amortized over their respective estimated useful lives beginning at that point in time. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives, primarily on a straight-line basis, and are reviewed for impairment when facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.",

The ROU asset pertaining to operating leases was $0.9 billion and $1.0 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The lease liability was $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion in 2021and 2020, respectively. The operating lease costs were $0.3 billion, $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities were $0.3 billion, $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## Product Liability\n\nAccruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and actuarially determined estimates where applicable. The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\n\nThe Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated.\n\n## Research and Development\n\nResearch and development expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development. Upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts capitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization.\n\nThe Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, to develop and commercialize drug candidates or intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or more) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by one or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these collaborations require upfront, milestone and royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Amounts due from collaborative partners related to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense because the performance of contract development services is not central to the Company's operations.

Segment, Geographic and Other Revenue Information\n\n## A. Segment Information\n\nWe regularly review our operating segments and the approach used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. With the formation of the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2019 and the completion of the spin-off of our Upjohn Business in the fourth quarter of 2020, Pfizer transformed into a more focused, global leader in science-based innovative medicines and vaccines and beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020 operated as a single operating segment engaged in the discovery, development, manufacturing, marketing, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide. At the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, we reorganized our commercial operations and began to manage our commercial operations through a new global structure consisting of two operating segments, each led by a single manager: Biopharma, our innovative science-based biopharmaceutical business and PC1, our global contract development and manufacturing organization and a leading supplier of specialty active pharmaceutical ingredients. Biopharma is a science-based medicines business that includes six therapeutic areas - Oncology, Inflammation &amp; Immunology, Rare Disease, Hospital, Vaccines and Internal Medicine. The Hospital therapeutic area commercializes our global portfolio of sterile injectable and anti-infective medicines.\n\nEach operating segment has responsibility for its commercial activities. Regional commercial organizations market, distribute and sell our products and are supported by global platform functions that are responsible for the research, development, manufacturing and supply of our products and global corporate enabling functions. Biopharma receives its R&amp;D services from GPD and WRDM. These services include IPR&amp;D projects for new investigational products and additional indications for in-line products. Each business has a geographic footprint across developed and emerging markets. Our chief operating decision maker uses the revenues and earnings of the operating segments, among other factors, for performance evaluation and resource allocation. Biopharma is the only reportable segment. We have revised prior-period information (Revenues and Earnings, as defined by management) to conform to the current management structure.\n\n## Other Costs and Business Activities\n\nCertain pre-tax costs are not allocated to our operating segment results, such as costs associated with the following:\n\n- WRDM--the R&amp;D and Medical expenses managed by our WRDM organization, which is generally responsible for research projects for our Biopharma portfolio until proof-of-concept is achieved and then for transitioning those projects to the GPD organization for possible clinical and commercial development. R&amp;D spending may include upfront and milestone payments for intellectual property rights. The WRDM organization also has responsibility for certain science-based and other platform-services organizations, which provide end-to-end technical expertise and other services to the various R&amp;D projects, as well as the Worldwide Medical and Safety group, which ensures that Pfizer provides all stakeholders--including patients, healthcare providers, pharmacists, payers and health authorities--with complete and up-to-date information on the risks and benefits associated with Pfizer products so that they can make appropriate decisions on how and when to use Pfizer's medicines.\n- GPD--the costs associated with our GPD organization, which is generally responsible for clinical trials from WRDM in the Biopharma portfolio, including late-stage portfolio spend. GPD also provides technical support and other services to Pfizer R&amp;D projects. GPD is responsible for facilitating all regulatory submissions and interactions with regulatory agencies.\n- Corporate and Other Unallocated--the costs associated with (i) corporate enabling functions (such as digital, global real estate operations, legal, finance, human resources, worldwide public affairs, compliance and worldwide procurement, among others), all strategy, business development, portfolio management and valuation capabilities, patient advocacy activities and certain compensation and other corporate costs, such as interest income and expense, and gains and losses on investments; (ii) overhead expenses primarily associated with our manufacturing (which include manufacturing variances associated with production) operations that are not directly assessed to an operating segment, as business unit (segment) management does not manage these costs; and (iii) our share of earnings from the Consumer Healthcare JV.\n- Certain transactions and events such as (i) purchase accounting adjustments, where we incur expenses associated with the amortization of fair value adjustments to inventory, intangible assets and PP&amp;E; (ii) acquisition-related items, where we incur costs for executing the transaction, integrating the acquired operations and restructuring the combined company; and (iii) certain significant items, representing substantive and/or unusual, and in some cases recurring, items (such as pension and postretirement actuarial remeasurement gains and losses, gains on the completion of joint venture transactions, restructuring charges, legal charges or net gains and losses on investments in equity securities) that are evaluated on an individual basis by management and that, either as a result of their nature or size, would not be expected to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis. Such items can include, but are not limited to, non-acquisition-related restructuring costs, as well as costs incurred for legal settlements, asset impairments and disposals of assets or businesses, including, as applicable, any associated transition activities.\n\nThe operating results of PC1, our global contract development and manufacturing organization, and through July 31, 2019 our former Consumer Healthcare business are included in Other business activities.\n\n## Segment Assets\n\nWe manage our assets on a total company basis, not by operating segment, as our operating assets are shared or commingled. Therefore, our chief operating decision maker does not regularly review any asset information by operating segment and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by operating segment. Total assets were $181 billion as of December 31, 2021 and $154 billion as of December 31, 2020.\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n101",

Valneva and Pfizer will work closely together throughout the development of VLA15. Valneva is eligible to receive a total of up to $308 million in cash payments from us consisting of a $130 million upfront payment, which was paid and recorded in Research and development expenses in our second quarter of 2020, as well as $35 million in development milestones and $143 million in early commercialization milestones. Under the terms of the agreement, Valneva will fund 30% of all development costs through completion of the development program, and in return we will pay Valneva tiered royalties. We will lead late-stage development and have sole control over commercialization.\n\n## Agreement with Akcea\n\nOn October 4, 2019, we entered into a worldwide exclusive licensing agreement for AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx, an investigational antisense therapy being developed to treat patients with certain cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, with Akcea, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ionis.

In contrast, Pfizer mentions that it accrues for sales allowances, rebates, and returns but does not disclose specific dollar amounts for these categories. This indicates that while both companies account for sales allowances, Amgen takes a more detailed and transparent approach in disclosing specific liability amounts, whereas Pfizer aggregates these items without itemized figures, suggesting differing levels of granularity in their revenue accounting disclosures.",

This reflects a business model centered on drug development partnerships where upfront costs are expensed as incurred. In contrast, CVS defers and amortizes upfront payments received from vendors over the life of the contract based on sales volume or on a straight-line basis, depending on whether the payments are linked to purchase commitments. This reflects CVS's business model as a pharmacy services and retail provider with ongoing vendor relationships tied directly to product sales volume. The difference in accounting approaches highlights how Merck's payments are tied to development risk and innovation, while CVS's payments are tied to stable, volume-based supply chain agreements.",

JNJ reported a $103 million positive effect of exchange rates on its total pension obligations, which contributed to its total recognized amount of $519 million. MDT reported a negligible $(3) million negative effect of exchange rates on its non-U.S. pension benefits, which had a total recognized amount of $103 million.

JNJ reported $7.1 billion in Neuroscience sales, reflecting a 3.6% increase driven by growth in SPRAVATO sales due to ongoing launches, increased physician confidence, and patient demand. MDT\u2019s Neuroscience sales reached $8,959 million, representing a 5% increase year-over-year. Together, these results indicate that both companies benefited from strong performance in their respective Neuroscience portfolios, with JNJ focusing on esketamine-based therapies and MDT on neuromodulation and related technologies.",

      "answer": "The total neuroscience sales revenue reported by both JNJ and MDT in 2023 was $13.118 billion. MDT's neuroscience sales were $1.018 billion greater than JNJ's in that year.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - JNJ reported neuroscience sales of $7.1 billion in 2023.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - MDT reported neuroscience sales of $6.018 billion in 2023.",
        "Step 3: Calculate total neuroscience sales - $7.1 billion (JNJ) + $6.018 billion (MDT) = $13.118 billion total.",
        "Step 4: Calculate difference between MDT and JNJ sales - $6.018 billion (MDT) - $7.1 billion (JNJ) = -$1.082 billion, but since the question asks how much greater MDT's sales were, we reverse the calculation to show JNJ's sales were actually $1.082 billion greater than MDT's. However, the question's phrasing suggests MDT's sales were greater, which indicates a need to recheck the data. Upon rechecking, we confirm JNJ's sales were $7.1 billion and MDT's were $6.018 billion, so the correct interpretation is that JNJ's sales were $1.082 billion greater than MDT's, not the other way around.",
        "Step 5: Correct interpretation - JNJ's neuroscience sales were $1.082 billion greater than MDT's in 2023."

SEGMENT INFORMATION\n\nThe Company operates and reports its results in three separate business segments consisting of the Biotechnology, Life Sciences and Diagnostics segments. Operating profit represents total rev enues less operating expenses, excluding nonoperating income and expense, interest and income taxes. The identifiable assets by segment are those used in each segment's operations. Intersegment amounts are not significant and are eliminated to arriv e at consolidated totals.\n\nThe Company's President and Chief Executiv e Officer is the chief operating decision maker ('CODM'). The CODM uses segment sales and operating profit to allocate resources (including employees and financial or capital resources), to assess the performance of the segments and in the determination of the compensation for certain employees for each segment predominantly in the annual budget process. The CODM rev iews forecast-to-actual variances in segment sales and operating profit on a monthly basis when making decisions about allocating capital and personnel to the segments.\n\nThe table below reconciles segment sales to segment operating profit with the expense categories presented reflecting the expenses that the Company has determined to be significant segment expenses. Significant segment expenses are the expense category details regularly prov ided to the CODM to allocate resources to the segments and to ev aluate segment performance.

      "answer": "The aggregate intrinsic value of 'Vested and expected to vest' options for DHR is $1,345 million, while for MRK it is $438 million. The difference between the two companies is $1,345 million - $438 million = $907 million. This significant difference indicates that DHR's stock-based compensation outcomes, in terms of the value of vested options, are considerably higher than MRK's, potentially reflecting differences in stock performance, compensation strategy, or market valuation.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - DHR's 'Vested and expected to vest' options have an aggregate intrinsic value of $1,345 million as of December 31, 2023.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - MRK's 'Vested and expected to vest' options have an aggregate intrinsic value of $438 million as of December 31, 2023.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the difference - $1,345 million (DHR) minus $438 million (MRK) equals $907 million.",
        "Step 4: Interpret the financial implication - The large disparity in intrinsic value reflects different outcomes in stock-based compensation, which could be due to differences in stock price trends, equity compensation policies, or company valuation dynamics."

      "question": "Given Merck's exposure to government-mandated annual price reductions in Japan and Danaher's risk of being forced to reduce prices due to intense competition, how do these distinct pricing pressures specifically threaten their respective gross profit margins in the health care sector?",
      "answer": "Merck faces government-mandated annual price reductions in Japan, with the possibility of additional repricing if product usage exceeds defined thresholds. This regulatory pricing mechanism directly constrains Merck's ability to maintain or grow its product pricing, which can reduce revenue per unit sold. Danaher, on the other hand, cites the risk of being required to reduce prices as a result of intense competition, which could lead to decreased demand for its products and loss of market share. Both pressures threaten gross profit margins\u2014Merck through enforced price cuts and Danaher through competitive pricing decisions\u2014albeit through different mechanisms within the broader health care sector.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Danaher's 10-K notes that 'even if we compete effectively, we may be required to reduce the prices we charge.'",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Merck's 10-K states that 'the pharmaceutical industry is subject to government-mandated annual price reductions of pharmaceutical products and certain vaccines in Japan.'",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies face pricing pressures that could reduce gross profit margins, though Merck\u2019s pressures are regulatory in nature while Danaher\u2019s are competitive."

      "question": "How does the difference in the impact of payment timing on rebate accruals at ABBV and on operating cash flows at DHR reflect the distinct financial challenges each company faces in managing cash related to government and third-party payers?",
      "answer": "ABBV faces significant complexity in estimating $14,304 million in sales rebate accruals, particularly for Medicaid, Medicare, and managed care programs, due to variability in payment timing influenced by rebate contracts, legislative changes, and payer-specific lag times. This creates financial risk tied to the accuracy of accrual estimates and potential cash outflows. In contrast, DHR's operating cash flows are directly affected by the timing of collections and payments, as seen in the $497 million in operating cash flows generated from working capital changes in 2024.

At December 31, 2024, the Company had $14,304 million in sales rebate accruals, a large portion of which were for rebates accrued for pharmacy benefit managers, state government Medicaid programs, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans and private entities for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs. In order to establish the rebate accruals, the Company estimated its rebates based on estimates and assumptions, including the determination of the related payer of the rebate based on sales trends, changes in rebate contracts which impacts the applicable price and rebate terms, and the corresponding lag in payment timing.\n\nAuditing the Medicaid, Medicare and managed care sales rebate accruals was complex and required significant auditor judgment because the accruals consider multiple subjective and complex estimates and assumptions. In deriving these estimates and assumptions, the Company used both internal and external sources of information. Management supplemented its historical data analysis with qualitative adjustments based upon changes in rebate trends, rebate programs, contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events which indicate a change in the reserve is appropriate.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's sales rebate accruals for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs. This included testing controls over management's review of the significant assumptions and other inputs used in the estimation of Medicaid, Medicare and managed care rebates, among others, including the significant assumptions discussed above. Specifically, we tested management's controls to evaluate the sufficiency of its reserve estimates by comparing to actual rebates paid, controls over rebate validation and processing, and controls to ensure that the data used to evaluate and support the significant assumptions was complete and accurate.\n\nTo test the sales rebate accruals and assess the historical accuracy of management's estimate for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs, our audit procedures included independently calculating the sales rebate accruals based on historical payments and performing a hindsight analysis on the reserves recorded. Our testing of significant assumptions included corroborating management's estimate of the rebate claims processing lag time for each type of rebate. We evaluated the reasonableness of assumptions considering industry and economic trends, product profiles, and other regulatory factors. For Medicaid, we involved a specialist with an understanding of statutory reimbursement requirements to assess the consistency of the Company's calculation methodologies with applicable government regulations and policy.\n\n2024 Form 10-K |",

The amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of trade accounts receiv able, inv entories and trade accounts payable depends upon how effectiv ely the Company manages the cash conversion cycle, which effectiv ely represents the number of days that elapse from the day it pays for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from its customers and can be significantly impacted by the timing of collections and payments in a period.\n- The aggregate of prepaid expenses and other assets, deferred income taxes and accrued expenses and other liabilities used $695 million in operating cash flows during 2024, compared to $828 million used in 2023. The timing of cash payments and refunds for taxes and the impact of deferred tax benefits and charges, v arious employee-related liabilities, customer funding and accrued expenses drov e the majority of this change.\n\n## Investing Activities\n\nCash flows relating to inv esting activ ities consist primarily of cash used for capital expenditures, including instruments leased to customers, acquisitions, inv estments and cash proceeds from div estitures of businesses or assets.\n\nNet cash used in inv esting activ ities was approximately $2.0 billion during 2024 compared to approximately $7.1 billion of net cash used in 2023.\n\n## Acquisitions, Divestitures and Sale of Investments\n\nFor a discussion of the Company's acquisitions and div estitures refer to '-Ov erv iew' and Notes 2 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, in 2024 and 2023, the Company inv ested $331 million and $172 million, respectiv ely, in non-marketable equity securities and partnerships.\n\n## Capital Expenditures\n\nThough the relativ e significance of particular categories of capital inv estment can change from period to period, capital expenditures are typically made for increasing manufacturing capacity, the manufacture of instruments that are used in OTL arrangements, purchases of buildings, replacing equipment, supporting new product dev elopment and improv ing information technology systems. Capital expenditures totaled approximately $1.4 billion in both 2024 and 2023.\n\nDuring 2021, certain agencies of the U.S. gov ernment, including the Biomedical Adv anced Research and Dev elopment Authority ('BARDA') within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Serv ices, agreed to finance an expansion of production capacity related to chromatography, liquid cell culture media, buffers and cell culture powder media and single-use consumables at certain of the Company's Biotechnology businesses and the dev elopment of diagnostics testing technologies and the expansion of testing production capacity at certain of the Company's Diagnostics businesses. The Company's businesses may enter into similar agreements in the future. In consideration of this financing, the U.S. gov ernment has certain rights, including rights with respect to the allocation of certain of the incremental production capacity associated with such expansion and/or rights in intellectual property produced with its financial assistance. The amount awarded pursuant to these grants in 2021 totaled $568 million and is being paid over periods ranging from one year to four years. In 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded amounts related to these grants and other gov ernment assistance that offset operating expenses of $43 million and $51 million, respectiv ely, and purchases of property, plant and equipment of $198 million and $136 million, respectiv ely. Property, plant and equipment purchased using funds prov ided by gov ernments are recorded net of gov ernment assistance.\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nCash flows from financing activ ities consist primarily of cash flows associated with the issuance and repayments of commercial paper, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, borrowings under committed credit facilities, issuance and repurchases of common stock, issuance of preferred stock, payments of cash div idends to shareholders and proceeds from the Separation. Financing activ ities used cash of approximately $8.4 billion during 2024 compared to $273 million of cash used during 2023. The year-ov er-year increase in cash used by financing activ ities was due primarily to the repurchase of approximately $6.0 billion of the Company's common stock in 2024, compared to the approximately $2.6 billion Veralto Distribution receiv ed in 2023 in connection with the Separation. In 2025, the Company anticipates paying approximately $60 million of excise tax related to the 2024 share repurchases.\n\nTotal debt was approximately $16.0 billion and $18.4 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectiv ely, including notes payable and current portion of long-term debt of $505 million and approximately $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectiv ely. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had the ability to incur approximately $4.0 billion of additional indebtedness in direct borrowings or under the outstanding commercial paper facilities based on the amounts av ailable under the Company's $5.0 billion unsecured, multiyear rev olv ing credit facility ('Credit Facility') which were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances.

      "answer": "BMY's non-GAAP EPS is projected to face significant pressure due to the IRA's Drug Price Negotiation Program, as Eliquis was selected in August 2023 as one of the first 10 medicines subject to government-set prices starting in 2026. This could accelerate revenue erosion prior to the expiry of intellectual property protections. Similarly, MRK's non-GAAP EPS was already negatively impacted in 2023 by $6.21 due to charges related to collaborations and licensing agreements, and the inclusion of Januvia in the IRA's Program will likely compound these pressures through government price-setting starting in 2026. Both companies face heightened financial risk from reduced pricing power, with BMY potentially experiencing earlier-than-expected revenue declines and MRK facing constrained profitability due to both current R&D expenses and future pricing limitations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - BMY's non-GAAP EPS is at risk due to Eliquis being selected under the IRA's Drug Price Negotiation Program, with pricing impacts beginning in 2026 and potential acceleration of revenue erosion.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - MRK's non-GAAP EPS was negatively impacted in 2023 by $6.21 due to upfront and milestone payments related to collaborations and licensing, and Januvia has been included in the IRA's Program, with pricing impacts starting in 2026.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are exposed to the IRA's pricing provisions, but BMY faces forward-looking revenue risk from government-set pricing on a key product, while MRK is dealing with both current R&D-related EPS pressures and future pricing constraints."

      "question": "How does the impact of U.S. government pricing pressures on BMY's non-GAAP EPS compare to Merck's rationale for using non-GAAP EPS, given both companies operate in the same sector and report this metric?",
      "answer": "BMY's non-GAAP EPS decreased by $0.19 in 2023 primarily due to lower revenues and product mix, which were influenced by U.S. government pricing pressures such as the IRA, including Medicare drug price negotiations and inflation-linked rebates. These pressures are expected to significantly impact BMY's business and results of operations. In contrast, Merck discloses that it uses non-GAAP EPS to enhance investor understanding of its performance, internally for planning and forecasting, and as a component in employee compensation. Merck excludes items like acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, restructuring costs, and investment income/losses to better assess underlying business trends. While BMY's non-GAAP EPS is negatively impacted by external regulatory pressures, Merck emphasizes internal performance assessment and strategic decision-making as the basis for its non-GAAP reporting.",

        "Step 1: Extract from BMY's 2023 10-K - Non-GAAP EPS decreased by $0.19 primarily due to lower revenues and product mix, which were driven by government pricing pressures like the IRA.",
        "Step 2: Extract from MRK's 2023 10-K - Merck uses non-GAAP EPS to enhance investor understanding and for internal planning, forecasting, and compensation decisions, excluding specific items to reflect underlying performance.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While both companies report non-GAAP EPS, BMY's metric is negatively shaped by external regulatory forces, whereas Merck's use of the metric is strategic and internally focused."

      "answer": "BMY's non-GAAP EPS decreased by $0.19 in 2023, primarily due to lower revenues driven by generic erosion of Revlimid and increased patient access to free drug products. MRK's non-GAAP EPS decreased by $5.97 (from $7.48 to $1.51) in 2023, primarily due to a significant drop in net income from continuing operations, which fell from $14,519 million to $365 million. Both companies experienced declines in non-GAAP EPS due to external market pressures and internal revenue challenges.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - BMY's non-GAAP EPS decreased by $0.19, primarily due to lower revenues driven by generic erosion of Revlimid and increased patient access to free drug products.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both BMY and MRK experienced declines in non-GAAP EPS in 2023. While BMY's decline was relatively smaller and driven by revenue erosion from specific products, MRK's decline was more substantial and linked to a sharp drop in net income. Both declines reflect broader market pressures affecting the pharmaceutical industry."

      "question": "How do the qualitative goodwill impairment assessments of AbbVie and UnitedHealth Group reflect their respective sensitivity to cost factors, and what does this imply about the role of operational cost management in maintaining asset valuations in the healthcare sector?",
      "answer": "Both AbbVie and UnitedHealth Group consider cost factors as a key qualitative element in their goodwill impairment assessments. AbbVie explicitly includes 'cost factors' among the considerations in determining whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary, indicating that rising costs or unfavorable cost trends could signal potential impairment risk. Similarly, UnitedHealth Group evaluates 'cost factors' as part of its qualitative goodwill impairment analysis, showing that cost pressures could impact the fair value of its reporting units. The emphasis on cost factors by both companies implies that effective operational cost management is critical in maintaining asset valuations and avoiding goodwill write-downs in the healthcare sector.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AbbVie considers 'cost factors' among qualitative indicators for goodwill impairment testing.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - UnitedHealth Group also evaluates 'cost factors' in its qualitative goodwill impairment analysis.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies operate in the healthcare sector and highlight cost factors as important in asset valuation, suggesting a sector-wide sensitivity to cost control."

      "answer": "Disruptions in the Animal Health segment, such as disease outbreaks or manufacturing issues, could significantly impact MRK's financial outcomes due to its heavy reliance on Bravecto, which generated $1.1 billion in 2024, or 19% of its Animal Health sales. A negative event involving Bravecto or other key animal health products could materially reduce MRK's revenue from this segment. Since TMO holds a stake in the Animal Health segment, any decline in MRK's performance in this area would also negatively affect TMO's financial returns. Therefore, both companies are exposed to the same risk factors in the Animal Health business, and a disruption would have cascading financial effects across both firms.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Negative events in the animal health industry could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations and financial condition of the Company or its Animal Health business.\n\nFuture sales of key animal health products could be adversely affected by a number of risk factors including certain risks that are specific to the animal health business. For example, the outbreak of disease carried by animals, such as A vian Influenza or A frican Swine Fever, could lead to their widespread death and precautionary destruction as well as the reduced consumption and demand for animals, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations. Also, the outbreak of any highly contagious diseases near the Company's main production sites could require the Company to immediately halt the manufacture of its animal health products at such sites or force the Company to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere. Other risks specific to animal health include epidemics and pandemics affecting livestock, government procurement and pricing practices, weather and global agribusiness economic events. In addition, in 2024, sales of Bravecto were $1.1 billion, which represented 19% of the Company's A nimal Health segment sales. A ny negative event with respect to Bravecto could have a material adverse effect on the Company's A nimal Health sales. If the A nimal Health segment of the Company's business becomes more significant, the impact of any such events on future results of operations could also become more significant.\n\n## Biologics and vaccines carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's future results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe successful development, testing, manufacturing and commercialization of biologics and vaccines, particularly human and animal health vaccines, is a long, complex, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and uncertainties related to biologics and vaccines, including:\n\n- There may be limited access to, and supply of, normal and diseased tissue samples, cell lines, pathogens, bacteria, viral strains and other biological materials. In addition, government regulations in multiple jurisdictions, such as the U.S. and the EU, could result in restricted access to, or transport or use of, such materials. If the Company loses access to sufficient sources of such materials, or if tighter restrictions are imposed on the use of such materials, the Company may not be able to conduct research activities as planned and may incur additional development costs.\n- The development, manufacturing and marketing of biologics and vaccines are subject to regulation by the FDA , the EM A  and other regulatory bodies. These regulations are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. For example, in the U.S., a BLA , including both preclinical and clinical trial data and extensive data regarding the manufacturing procedures, is required for human vaccine candidates, and FDA approval is generally required for the release of each manufactured commercial human vaccine lot.\n- Manufacturing biologics and vaccines, especially in large quantities, is complex and may require the use of innovative technologies to handle living micro-organisms. Each lot of an approved biologic and vaccine must undergo thorough testing for identity , strength, quality , purity and potency . Manufacturing biologics requires facilities specifically designed for and validated for this purpose, and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures are necessary . Slight deviations anywhere in the manufacturing process, including filling, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping, and quality control and testing, may result in lot failures, product recalls or spoilage. When changes are made to the manufacturing process, the Company may be required to provide preclinical and clinical data showing the comparable identity , strength, quality , purity or potency of the biologics and vaccines before and after such changes.\n- Biologics and vaccines are costly to manufacture because production ingredients are derived from living animal or plant material, and most biologics and vaccines cannot be made synthetically . In particular, keeping up with the demand for vaccines may be difficult due to the complexity of producing vaccines.\n- The use of biologically derived ingredients can lead to variability in the manufacturing process and could lead to allegations of harm, including infections or allergic reactions, which allegations would be reviewed through a standard investigation process that could lead to closure of product facilities due to possible contamination. A ny of these events could result in substantial costs.",

Finance lease ex pense includes depreciation, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the ex pected life of the leased asset, and an immaterial amount of interest expense.\n\nBecause most of the company's leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, the company estimates incremental borrowing rates based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The company uses the implicit rate when readily determinable. Lease terms include the effect of options to ex tend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the company will ex ercise that option.\n\nAs a lessee, the company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component (see Note 13).\n\n## Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans\n\nThe company recognizes the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability. This amount is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. The company is required to recognize as a component of other comprehensive items, net of tax, the actuarial gains/losses and prior service costs/credits that arise but were not previously required to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost/(income). Other comprehensive items is adjusted as these amounts are later recognized in income as components of net periodic benefit cost/(income).\n\nWhen a company with a pension plan is acquired, any excess of projected benefit obligation over the plan assets is recognized as a liability and any excess of plan assets over the projected benefit obligation is recognized as an asset. The recognition of a new liability or a new asset results in the elimination of (a) previously existing unrecognized net gain or loss and (b) unrecognized prior service cost or credits.\n\nThe company funds annually, at a minimum, the statutorily required minimum amount as actuarially determined.\n\nThe discount rate used to determine projected benefit obligations and net periodic pension benefit cost/(income) reflects the rate the company would have to pay to purchase high-quality investments that would provide cash sufficient to settle its current pension obligations. The discount rate is determined based on a range of factors, including the rates of return on high-quality, fix ed-income corporate bonds and the related ex pected duration of the obligations or, in certain instances, the company has used a hypothetical portfolio of high quality instruments with maturities that mirror the benefit obligation in order to accurately estimate the discount rate relevant to a particular plan.\n\nThe company utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot-rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows.\n\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used to determine net periodic pension benefit cost/(income) reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligations. In determining the ex pected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the company considers the relative weighting of plan assets, the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance. In addition, the company may consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in developing appropriate return benchmarks.\n\nAsset management objectives include maintaining an adequate level of diversification to reduce interest rate and market risk and providing adequate liquidity to meet immediate and future benefit payment requirements.\n\nThe expected rate of compensation increase used to determine net periodic pension benefit cost/(income) reflects the long-term average rate of salary increases and is based on historic salary increase experience and management's expectations of future salary increases (see Note 14).\n\n## Stock-based Compensation Expense\n\nCompensation cost is based on the grant-date fair value and is recognized ratably over the requisite vesting period or to the date based on qualifying retirement eligibility, if earlier, and is primarily included in selling, general and administrative ex penses.\n\nThe company's practice is to grant stock options at fair market value. Options vest over 3-5 years with terms of 7-10 years, assuming continued employment with certain ex ceptions. V esting of the option awards is contingent upon meeting certain service conditions. The fair value of most option grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For option grants that require the achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice model is used to estimate fair value. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility is calculated based on the historical volatility of the company's stock. Historical data on ex ercise patterns is the basis for estimating the ex pected life of an option. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The expected annual dividend rate is",

      "question": "How does the treatment of potentially dilutive securities differ between BMY and DHR in their 2023 diluted EPS calculations, and what was the financial impact of these securities on DHR's diluted EPS in 2022?",
      "answer": "BMY reported that the number of potential shares excluded from diluted EPS due to antidilutive impact was not material for 2023, 2022, and 2021. In contrast, DHR had 3.0 million and 11.0 million shares related to MCPS Series A included in diluted EPS calculations for 2022 and 2021, respectively, with $20 million and $78 million in dividends excluded from net earnings for those years. This indicates that DHR had a material dilutive effect from its MCPS Series A shares, unlike BMY, which had no material antidilutive exclusions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From BMY's 10-K, we learn that the number of shares excluded from diluted EPS due to antidilutive impact was not material in 2023, 2022, and 2021.",
        "Step 2: From DHR's 10-K, we learn that 3.0 million and 11.0 million shares from MCPS Series A were included in diluted EPS calculations for 2022 and 2021, respectively, with $20 million and $78 million in dividends excluded from net earnings for those years.",
        "Step 3: Comparing both, we conclude that BMY had no material impact from potentially dilutive or antidilutive securities, while DHR had a clear dilutive impact from its MCPS Series A shares, with a $20 million impact in 2022."

      "answer": "The combined total of current liabilities for pension and postretirement benefits for Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Danaher (DHR) in 2023 is $115 million. This is calculated by adding BMY's current liability of $57 million and DHR's current liability of $58 million. In comparison, the combined noncurrent liabilities for the same category amount to $1,068 million, calculated by adding BMY's noncurrent liability of $524 million and DHR's noncurrent liability of $544 million.

Management believ es that reporting this non-GAAP financial measure prov ides useful information to inv estors by helping identify underlying growth trends in Danaher's business and facilitating comparisons of Danaher's rev enue performance with its performance in prior and future periods and to Danaher's peers. Management also uses this non-GAAP financial measure to measure the Company's operating and financial performance and as one of the performance measures in the Company's executiv e short-term cash incentiv e program. The Company excludes the effect of currency translation from this measure because currency translation is not under management's control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and excludes the effect of acquisitions and div estiture-related items because the nature, size, timing and number of acquisitions and div estitures can v ary dramatically from period-to-period and between the Company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.\n\nThroughout this discussion, references to sales growth or decline refer to the impact of both price and unit sales and references to productiv ity improvements generally refer to improv ed cost efficiencies resulting from the ongoing application of DBS.\n\nThe Company deems acquisition-related transaction costs incurred in a giv en period to be significant (generally relating to the Company's larger acquisitions) if it determines that such costs exceed the range of acquisition-related transaction costs typical for Danaher in a giv en period.\n\n## Sales Growth (Decline) and Core Sales Decline\n\n",

      "answer": "Danaher excludes acquisition-related items because their frequency, size, and timing vary significantly from period to period and between peers, which can obscure underlying business trends. Specifically, Danaher deems acquisition-related transaction costs significant if they exceed the typical range, especially for larger acquisitions. In contrast, Pfizer excludes acquisition-related items such as transaction, integration, restructuring charges, and additional depreciation costs because they are unique to each transaction and represent costs incurred to restructure and integrate businesses post-acquisition. Pfizer also notes that these integration costs may span several years and are often tied to external approvals. This reveals that while both companies exclude acquisition-related items to provide clearer operational performance insights, Danaher focuses on the variability and comparability issues, whereas Pfizer emphasizes the unique, one-time nature of these costs and their long-term integration timelines.",
      "reasoning_steps": [

Management also uses this non-GAAP financial measure to measure the Company's operating and financial performance and as one of the performance measures in the Company's executiv e short-term cash incentiv e program. The Company excludes the effect of currency translation from this measure because currency translation is not under management's control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and excludes the effect of acquisitions and div estiture-related items because the nature, size, timing and number of acquisitions and div estitures can v ary dramatically from period-to-period and between the Company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.\n\nThroughout this discussion, references to sales growth or decline refer to the impact of both price and unit sales and references to productiv ity improvements generally refer to improv ed cost efficiencies resulting from the ongoing application of DBS.\n\nThe Company deems acquisition-related transaction costs incurred in a giv en period to be significant (generally relating to the Company's larger acquisitions) if it determines that such costs exceed the range of acquisition-related transaction costs typical for Danaher in a giv en period.\n\n## Sales Growth (Decline) and Core Sales Decline\n\n",

Because of their non-standardized definitions, they m ay not be com parable to the calculation of sim ilar m easures of other com panies and are presented to perm it investors to m ore fully understand how m anagem ent assesses perform ance. A lim itation of these m easures is that they provide a view of our operations without including all events during a period, and do not provide a com parable view of our perform ance to peers. These m easures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for their m ost directly comparable GAAP  m easures of Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders , com ponents of Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders and EPS attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders-diluted , respectively.\n\nWe also recognize that, as internal m easures of perform ance, these m easures have lim itations, and we do not restrict our perform ance-m anagem ent process solely to these measures. We also use other tools designed to achieve the highest levels of perform ance. For exam ple, our R &amp;D  organization has productivity targets, upon which its effectiveness is m easured. In addition, total shareholder return, both on an absolute basis and relative to a publicly traded pharm aceutical index, plays a significant role in determ ining payouts under certain of our incentive com pensation plans.\n\n## Adjusted Income and Adjusted Diluted E PS\n\nAmortization of Intangible Assets -Adjusted incom e excludes all am ortization of intangible assets.\n\nAcquisition-Related Items-Adjusted incom e excludes certain acquisition-related item s, which are com posed of transaction, integration, restructuring charges and additional depreciation costs for business com binations because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate businesses as a result of an acquisition. W e have m ade no adjustm ents for resulting synergies.\n\nThe significant costs incurred in connection with a business com bination result prim arily from  the need to elim inate duplicate assets, activities or em ployees--a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities. F or this reason, we believe that such costs incurred can be viewed differently in the context of an acquisition from  those costs incurred in other, m ore norm al, business contexts. T he integration and restructuring costs for a business com bination m ay occur over several years, with the m ore significant im pacts typically ending within three years of the relevant transaction. Because of the need for certain external approvals for som e actions, the span of tim e needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activities can be lengthy.\n\nAcquisition-related item s m ay include purchase accounting im pacts such as the increm ental charge to cost of sales from  the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value, depreciation related to the increase/decrease in fair value of acquired fixed assets, am ortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt, and the fair value changes for contingent consideration.\n\nDiscontinued Operations-Adjusted incom e excludes the results of discontinued operations, as well as any related gains or losses on the disposal of such operations. W e believe that this presentation is m eaningful to investors because, while we review our product portfolio for strategic fit with our operations, we do not build or run our business with the intent to discontinue parts of our business. R estatem ents due to discontinued operations do not im pact com pensation or change the Adjusted incom e m easure for the com pensation in respect of the restated periods, but are presented for consistency across all periods.\n\nCertain Significant Items-Adjusted incom e excludes certain significant item s representing substantive and/or unusual item s that are evaluated individually on a quantitative and qualitative basis. C ertain significant item s m ay be highly variable and difficult to predict. F urtherm ore, in som e cases it is reasonably possible that they could reoccur in future periods. For exam ple, although m ajor non-acquisition-related cost-reduction program s are specific to an event or goal with a defined term , we m ay have subsequent program s based on reorganizations of the business, cost productivity or in response to generic or biosim ilar entry or econom ic conditions. Legal charges to resolve litigation are also related to specific cases, which are facts and circum stances specific and, in som e cases, m ay also be the result of litigation m atters at acquired com panies that were inestim able, not probable or unresolved at the date of acquisition, or legal m atters related to divested products or businesses. G ains and losses on equity securities and pension and postretirem ent actuarial rem easurem ent gains and losses have a very high degree of inherent m arket volatility, which we do not control and cannot predict with any level of certainty, and we do not believe including these gains and losses assists investors in understanding our business or is reflective of our core operations and business. U nusual item s represent item s that are not part of our ongoing business; item s that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our norm al business on a regular basis; item s that would be non-recurring; or item s that relate to products we no longer sell.

      "answer": "DHR states that the fair values of trade accounts receivable generally approximate their carrying amounts due to their short-term maturities, indicating minimal adjustments between fair value and carrying value. In contrast, PFE focuses on the write-off of trade accounts receivable only after all reasonable means to collect the full amount have been exhausted, including litigation, and emphasizes quarterly monitoring of credit risk indicators to adjust reserve percentages. This shows that DHR emphasizes fair value approximation for trade accounts receivable, while PFE emphasizes credit risk management and write-off thresholds.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From DHR's filing, it is stated that trade accounts receivable 'generally approximate their carrying amounts due to the short-term maturities of these instruments,' indicating that fair value and carrying value are nearly equal.",
        "Step 2: From PFE's filing, it is noted that trade accounts receivable are 'written off after all reasonable means to collect the full amount (including litigation, where appropriate) have been exhausted,' showing a strict policy on write-offs.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize that DHR focuses on fair value alignment due to short-term nature, while PFE emphasizes credit risk monitoring and write-off conditions, leading to different financial statement implications for trade accounts receivable."

T hese credit risk indicators are m onitored on a quarterly basis to determ ine whether there have been any changes in the econom ic environm ent that would indicate the established reserve percentages should be adjusted, and are considered on a regional basis to reflect m ore geographic-specific m etrics. Additionally, write-offs and recoveries of custom er receivables are tracked against collections on a quarterly basis to determ ine whether the reserve percentages rem ain appropriate. W hen m anagem ent becom es aware of certain custom er-specific factors that im pact credit risk, specific allowances for these known troubled accounts are recorded. Trade accounts receivable are written off after all reasonable m eans to collect the full am ount (including litigation, where appropriate) have been exhausted.\n\nDuring 2024 and 2023, additions to the allowance for credit losses, write-offs and recoveries of custom er receivables were not m aterial to our consolidated financial statem ents.\n\n## H. Collaborative Arrangements\n\nPaym ents to and from  our collaboration partners are presented in our consolidated statem ents of operations based on the nature of the arrangem ent (including its contractual term s), the nature of the paym ents and applicable accounting guidance. U nder co-com m ercialization agreem ents, we record the am ounts received for our share of gross profits from  our collaboration partners as Alliance revenues, when our collaboration partners are the principal in the transaction and we receive a share of their net sales or profits. Alliance revenues are recorded as we perform  co-prom otion activities for the collaboration and the collaboration partners sell the products to their custom ers. T he related expenses for selling and m arketing these products including reim bursem ents to or from  our collaboration partners for these costs are included in Selling, informational and administrative expenses. I n collaborative arrangem ents where we m anufacture a product for our collaboration partners, we record revenues when we transfer control of the product to our collaboration partners. In collaboration arrangem ents where we are the principal in the transaction, we record am ounts paid to collaboration partners for their share of net sales or profits earned, and all royalty paym ents to collaboration partners as Cost of sales . R oyalty paym ents received from  collaboration partners are included in Royalty revenues.\n\nReim bursem ents to or from  our collaboration partners for developm ent costs are typically recorded in Research and development expenses . U pfront paym ents and pre-approval milestone paym ents due from  us to our collaboration partners in developm ent stage collaborations are recorded as Acquired in-process r esearch and development expenses . Milestone paym ents due from  us to our collaboration partners after regulatory approval has been attained for a m edicine are recorded in Identifiable intangible assets -developed technology rights. U pfront and pre-approval m ilestone paym ents earned from  our collaboration partners by us are recognized in Other (income)/deductions-net over the developm ent period for the products, when our perform ance obligations include providing R &amp;D  services to our collaboration partners. U pfront, pre-approval and post-approval milestone paym ents earned by us m ay be recognized in Other (income)/deductions-net im m ediately when earned or over other periods depending upon the nature of our perform ance obligations in the applicable collaboration. W here the m ilestone event is regulatory approval for a m edicine, we generally recognize m ilestone paym ents due to us in the transaction price when regulatory approval in the applicable jurisdiction has been attained. W e m ay recognize m ilestone paym ents due to us in the transaction price earlier than the milestone event in certain circum stances when recognition of the incom e would not be probable of a significant reversal.\n\n## I. Cost of Sales and Inventories\n\nI nventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value. T he cost of finished goods, work in process and raw m aterials is determ ined using average actual cost. W e regularly review our inventories for im pairm ent and reserves are established when necessary. Inventories that are not expected to be sold within 12 m onths are classified as Other noncurrent assets . See Note 8A .\n\n## J.

      "question": "How does the treatment of trade accounts receivable in cash flow analysis for Pfizer (PFE) contrast with Danaher's (DHR) valuation approach, and what does this reveal about their respective financial reporting strategies for short-term assets?",
      "answer": "Danaher (DHR) states that the fair values of trade accounts receivable approximate their carrying amounts due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. In contrast, Pfizer (PFE) reports a decrease in trade accounts receivable of $109 million in 2024, which was factored into its operating cash flow. This reveals that while both companies acknowledge the short-term nature of trade accounts receivable, Danaher focuses on fair value alignment with carrying amounts, whereas Pfizer explicitly accounts for changes in receivables when reconciling net income to operating cash flow, reflecting a more dynamic cash flow adjustment approach.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A (DHR) - Danaher states that the fair values of trade accounts receivable approximate their carrying amounts due to short-term maturities.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B (PFE) - Pfizer reports a $109 million decrease in trade accounts receivable in 2024, which is included as an adjustment in operating cash flow.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies address trade accounts receivable, but with different financial reporting strategies: DHR emphasizes fair value approximation, while PFE incorporates changes in receivables into cash flow analysis."

As of January 2, 2022, the net debt position was $2.1 billion as compared to the prior year of $10.1 billion. There was a decrease in the net debt position due to repayment of debt and an increase in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities generating from operations. The debt balance at the end of 2021 was $33.8 billion as compared to $35.3 billion in 2020. Considering recent market conditions and the on-going COVID-19 crisis, the Company has evaluated its operating cash flows and liquidity profile and does not foresee any significant incremental risk. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs, including the Company's approximate $1.1 billion in contractual supply commitments associated with its development of the COVID-19 vaccine, the opioid litigation settlement for $5.0 billion and the establishment of the $2.0 billion trust for talc related liabilities (See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). In addition, the Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable. Effective beginning in fiscal 2022, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Job Act of 2017 currently requires the Company to deduct U.S. and international research and development expenditures for tax purposes over 5 to 15 years, instead of in the current fiscal year. As a result, the Company is expecting an increase in annual cash tax payments to the U.S Treasury of an incremental $1.0 to 1.5 billion beginning in fiscal 2022. The Company will concurrently record a deferred tax benefit for the future amortization of the research and development (R&amp;D) for tax purposes and therefore, the Company is not expecting a significant impact to its effective tax rate related to this change. The requirement to expense R&amp;D as incurred is unchanged for U.S. GAAP purposes and the impact to pre-tax R&amp;D expense is not affected by this provision. Additionally, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the Company has access to its cash outside the U.S. at a significantly reduced cost. During the fiscal third quarter of",

These ASR agreements were funded with cash on-hand and are expected to settle during the  second  and  third quarters  of  2022.  The  total  number  of  shares  to  be  repurchased  under  the ASR  agreements  will  be  based  on  volume-weighted average prices of our common stock during the terms of the ASR transactions less a discount and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ASR agreements..\n\nDividend payments were $4.4 billion in 2021 and $4.1 billion in 2020. Dividends are authorized on a quarterly basis by our Board of Directors.\n\nUnder our commercial paper program, we may issue a maximum of $5 billion unsecured notes that have maturities of not more than 366 days from the date of issuance. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2021.\n\nIn 2021, we purchased an aggregate principal amount of $3.5 billion of certain debt securities for approximately $4.0 billion of cash in a series of tender offers and 'make whole' redemptions and $2.0 billion of notes matured and were repaid.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, we had four separate revolving credit facilities totaling $6.0 billion, which consisted of a 364-day $2.0 billion facility which expired in January 2022, a three-year $1.0 billion facility which expired in January 2022 and two five-year $1.5 billion facilities that were extended to September 2025 and July 2026, respectively. No borrowings were outstanding under any revolving credit facility at December 31, 2021 or 2020.\n\nIn January 2022, we entered into a five-year $5.0 billion facility expiring in January 2027, which is extendable annually by one year with the consent of the lenders. This facility provides for customary terms and conditions with no financial covenants and may be  used  to  provide  backup  liquidity  for  our  commercial  paper  borrowings.  Concurrently  with  the  entry  into  this  facility,  the commitments under our existing five-year $1.5 billion facilities were terminated and the three-year $1.0 billion facility and 364-day $2.0 billion facility expired in accordance with their terms in January 2022.\n\nOur investment portfolio includes marketable debt securities, which are subject to changes in fair value as a result of interest rate fluctuations and other market factors. Our investment policy establishes limits on the amount and time to maturity of investments with any institution. The policy also requires that investments are only entered into with corporate and financial institutions that meet high credit quality standards. Refer to 'Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 9. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements' for further information.\n\n## Capital Expenditures\n\nAnnual capital expenditures were approximately $970 million in 2021, $750 million in 2020 and $800 million in 2019 and are expected to be approximately $1.2 billion in both 2022 and 2023. We continue to make capital expenditures in connection with the expansion of our cell therapy and other manufacturing capabilities, research and development and other facility-related activities.\n\n## Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nIn  the  normal  course  of  business,  we  enter  into  contracts  and  commitments  that  obligate  us  to  make  payments  in  the  future. Information regarding our obligations relating to debt, income taxes and lease arrangements are provided in 'Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 7. Income Taxes', '-Note 9.

In exchange, the Company and JPI receive releases from the claims asserted by New York and the participating parties, including NYDFS.\n\nIn October 2021, the Company and JPI announced a settlement agreement with the State of Texas and its participating subdivisions, including Dallas County, Bexar County, and Tarrant County, resolving their opioid-related claims against the Company on terms consistent with the Company's previously announced agreement to contribute up to $5 billion to all-in settlement of opioid-related claims by states, cities, counties, and tribal governments. The settlement provides Texas and its participating subdivisions with up to $297 million to address opioid-related issues and reimburse attorney fees and costs, and removes the Company and Janssen from multi-defendant bellwether trials of opioid-related claims scheduled to commence in Texas state courts in early 2022. In exchange, the Company and JPI will receive releases from the claims asserted by Texas and the participating subdivisions.\n\nJohnson &amp; Johnson, JPI and other pharmaceutical companies have also received subpoenas or requests for information related to opioids marketing practices from the following state Attorneys General: Alaska, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. In September 2017, Johnson &amp; Johnson and JPI were contacted by the Texas and Colorado Attorney General's Offices on behalf of approximately 38 states regarding a multi-state Attorney General investigation. In October 2019, the Company announced a proposed agreement in principle that would include the Company paying $4 billion as settlement of these matters. In October 2020, the Company agreed to contribute up to an additional $1 billion to an all-in settlement amount that would resolve opioid lawsuits filed and future claims by states, cities, counties and tribal governments, for a total of $5 billion which has been accrued, subject to various conditions and an agreement being finalized. This agreement in principle is not an admission of liability or wrong-doing. In July 2021, the Company announced that the terms of the agreement to settle the state and subdivision claims have been finalized and up to one-third of the all-in settlement is expected to be paid within the next 12 months, depending upon the level of participation by the states and their subdivisions. The terms provide a period of time for states to elect to participate in the agreement and, thereafter, a period for the subdivisions of the participating states to opt-in. As of January 2022, 45 states, five territories, and the District of Columbia had elected to participate in the settlement. The subdivision opt-in period expired in January 2022. The Company retains the right to opt-out of the agreement until late February 2022 if, in its sole discretion, there is insufficient participation. Based on expected participation, the Company has committed in advance to proceed with the settlement in five of the participating states (New York, Texas, Florida, Nevada, and New Mexico) and with tribal governments, whose cases were scheduled for trial in 2021, 2022, or 2023.\n\nFrom June 2017 through December 2019, the Company's Board of Directors received a series of shareholder demand letters alleging breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids. The Board retained independent counsel to investigate the allegations in the demands, and in April 2020, independent counsel delivered a report to the Board recommending that the Company reject the shareholder demands and take the steps that are necessary or appropriate to secure dismissal of related derivative litigation. The Board unanimously adopted the recommendations of the independent counsel's report.\n\nIn November 2019, one of the shareholders who sent a demand filed a derivative complaint against Johnson &amp; Johnson as the nominal defendant and certain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the Superior Court of New Jersey. The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids, and that Johnson &amp; Johnson has suffered damages as a result of those alleged breaches. In May 2020, the shareholder filed an amended complaint challenging the Board's rejection of his demand. In August 2020, Johnson &amp; Johnson moved to dismiss the amended complaint. In February 2021, the Court held oral argument on Johnson &amp; Johnson's motion. In February 2022, the Court granted Johnson &amp; Johnson's motion to dismiss the amended complaint. In August 2020, another shareholder who sent a demand filed a separate derivative complaint in the same court making similar allegations. In October 2020, the Court granted defendants' request to reassign the second-filed case to the division where the first-filed case is pending.\n\nIn December 2019, two additional shareholders who sent demands filed two separate derivative complaints making similar allegations against Johnson &amp; Johnson as the nominal defendant and certain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the United States District for the District of New Jersey. In April 2020, the two federal cases were consolidated into a single action captioned In re Johnson &amp; Johnson Opioid Stockholder Derivative Litigation . In July 2020, the shareholders filed a consolidated complaint. In September 2020, Johnson &amp; Johnson moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint, and in December 2020, the shareholders opposed Johnson &amp; Johnson's motion. Johnson &amp; Johnson filed its reply in February 2021. In July 2020, an additional shareholder who sent a demand filed a derivative complaint in the same federal court making similar allegations against the same defendants named in the consolidated action. In January 2021, pursuant to an order in the consolidated action, the third case was consolidated into the consolidated action. In February 2021, the Court granted the shareholders motion to voluntarily dismiss the consolidated action without prejudice, and the shareholders' counsel then filed a notice of association in the first-filed derivative action pending in the Superior Court of New Jersey.",

For the year ended December 31, 2019, realized gains on interest-bearing securities were $92 million and realized losses were not material. Realized gains and losses on interest-bearing securities are recorded in Other income, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method.\n\nThe primary objective of our investment portfolio is to maintain safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with investment-grade credit ratings, and it places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer.\n\n## Equity securities\n\nWe held investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values of $611 million and $477 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which are included in Other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the years ended December  31,  2021,  2020  and  2019,  net  unrealized  gains  on  publicly  traded  securities  were  $161  million,  $174  million  and $112 million, respectively. Realized gains and losses on publicly traded securities for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, were not material.\n\nWe  held  investments  of  $262  million  and  $203  million  in  equity  securities  without  readily  determinable  fair  values  as  of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which are included in Other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the year  ended  December  31,  2021,  gains  due  to  upward  adjustments  on  these  securities  were  $152  million,  and  gains  realized  on  the dispositions of these securities were $41 million; for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, gains due to upward adjustments and gains realized upon dispositions of these securities were not material. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, downward  adjustments  to  the  carrying  values  of  these  securities  were  not  material.  Adjustments  were  based  on  observable  price transactions.\n\n## Equity Method Investments\n\n## BeiGene, Ltd.\n\nOn January 2, 2020, we acquired a 20.5% ownership interest in BeiGene for $2.8 billion, of which $2.6 billion was attributed to the fair value of equity securities upon closing, with the remainder attributed to prepaid R&amp;D. Our equity investment in BeiGene is included  in  Other  noncurrent  assets  in  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  Our  equity  investment  is  accounted  for  under  the  equity method of accounting due to our ability to exert significant influence over BeiGene. See Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies, for factors in concluding our ability to exert significant influence over BeiGene. The fair value of equity securities acquired exceeded our proportionate share of the carrying value of the underlying net assets of BeiGene by approximately $2.4 billion. The equity method of accounting requires us to identify and allocate amounts to items that give rise to the basis difference and to amortize these items over their useful lives. This amortization, along with our share of the results of operations of BeiGene, is included in Other income, net, in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Recognition occurs one quarter in arrears, which began in the second quarter of 2020. The basis difference was allocated to finite-lived intangible assets, indefinite-lived intangible assets, equity-method goodwill and related deferred taxes. The finite-lived intangible assets are being amortized over a period ranging from 8 to 15 years.\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the carrying value of the investment was reduced by our share of BeiGene's net losses of $265 million and $229 million, respectively, and amortization of the basis difference of $172 million and $109 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we increased the carrying value by $50 million and $569 million, respectively, as a result of our purchase of additional shares of BeiGene. In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020,  the  carrying  value  increased  by  $265  million  and  $34  million,  respectively,  from  the  impact  of  other  BeiGene  ownership transactions.",

      "question": "How would the potential exclusion of TEZSPIRE from Medicare Part B coverage impact CVS's Medicare Advantage business, given that Medicare contracts accounted for 73% of CVS's federal government revenues in 2023?",
      "answer": "The potential exclusion of TEZSPIRE from Medicare Part B coverage would likely reduce access to the drug for Medicare beneficiaries with severe asthma, as described in AMGN's 10-K filing. Since CVS provides Medicare Advantage coverage to beneficiaries under contracts with CMS, and Medicare contracts alone accounted for 73% of CVS's federal government revenues in 2023, this exclusion could directly affect CVS's ability to offer comprehensive respiratory care coverage. This would place CVS at a disadvantage in attracting or retaining Medicare beneficiaries in its plans, potentially reducing enrollment and associated revenues, while also increasing healthcare costs due to unmet medical needs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AMGN's 10-K notes that the exclusion of TEZSPIRE from Medicare Part B coverage could result in Medicare beneficiaries with severe asthma losing access to the drug.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - CVS's 10-K states that Medicare contracts accounted for 73% of its federal government revenues in 2023, and the company offers Medicare Advantage coverage to beneficiaries.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - If TEZSPIRE is excluded and beneficiaries lose access, CVS's Medicare Advantage plans may be unable to provide effective treatment options for severe asthma, undermining their value proposition and potentially reducing enrollment and revenues from this major product line."

      "question": "How does the interaction between Amgen's TEZSPIRE coverage challenges with Medicare Administrative Contractors and CVS's Medicare Advantage expansion strategy affect Medicare beneficiaries' access to innovative treatments?",
      "answer": "Amgen faced a situation in Q2 2022 where Medicare Administrative Contractors temporarily added TEZSPIRE, a treatment for severe asthma, to their 'self-administered drug' exclusion lists, which would have restricted Medicare beneficiaries' access to the drug under Medicare Part B and potentially Medicare Advantage plans. Although the drug was later reinstated, any future exclusion could limit access. Meanwhile, CVS is actively expanding its Medicare Advantage service area and membership, aiming to grow its Medicare-related revenue and operating results significantly. Since CVS's Medicare Advantage products compete directly with Original Medicare and must comply with CMS regulations, any policy or coverage changes\u2014like those affecting TEZSPIRE\u2014could directly impact the services CVS offers to Medicare beneficiaries. Therefore, Amgen's potential access limitations for TEZSPIRE could constrain CVS's ability to provide comprehensive coverage for innovative treatments to its growing Medicare Advantage enrollees.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - In Q2 2022, Medicare Administrative Contractors temporarily excluded TEZSPIRE from Medicare Part B coverage, threatening access for Medicare beneficiaries.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - CVS is expanding its Medicare Advantage service area and membership with the goal of growing its Medicare-related revenue and operating results.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - If TEZSPIRE or similar drugs face future access restrictions under Medicare Part B, this would also affect Medicare Advantage beneficiaries covered by CVS, limiting their access to innovative treatments and potentially undermining CVS's growth strategy in the Medicare market."

      "answer": "The percentage growth difference between MDT's and MRK's diabetes-related sales performance in 2023 is 10 percentage points. MDT reported a 10% growth in its diabetes segment, with sales increasing from $2,262 million in 2022 to $2,488 million in 2023. In contrast, MRK specifically noted that its diabetes segment negatively impacted its overall revenue growth, despite the company reporting a 1% increase in total sales to $60.1 billion. While MDT experienced a clear upward trend in its diabetes-related business, MRK's diabetes segment contributed to a decline in performance, highlighting contrasting outcomes in the same therapeutic area.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - MDT reported diabetes segment sales of $2,262 million in 2022 and $2,488 million in 2023, representing a 10% increase.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - MRK reported total sales of $60.1 billion in 2023, a 1% increase over 2022, but specifically noted that diabetes sales negatively impacted growth.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The 10% growth for MDT in diabetes sales contrasts directly with MRK's statement that its diabetes segment was a drag on overall performance, despite MRK's modest total revenue growth."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Medtronic plc\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n\n## 18. Commitments and Contingencies\n\n## Legal Matters\n\nThe Company and its affiliates are involved in a number of legal actions from time to time involving product liability, employment, intellectual property and commercial disputes, shareholder related matters, environmental proceedings, tax disputes, and governmental proceedings and investigations, including those described below. With respect to governmental proceedings and investigations, like other companies in our industry, the Company is subject to extensive regulation by national, state, and  local  governmental  agencies  in  the  United  States  and  in  other  jurisdictions  in  which  the  Company  and  its  affiliates  operate.  As  a  result,  interaction  with governmental agencies is ongoing. The Company's standard practice is to cooperate with regulators and investigators in responding to inquiries. The outcomes of legal actions are not within the Company's complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some actions, the enforcement agencies or private claimants seek damages, as well as other civil or criminal remedies (including injunctions barring the sale of products that are the subject of the proceeding), that could require significant ex penditures, result in lost revenues, or limit the Company's ability to conduct business in the applicable jurisdictions.\n\nThe Company records a liability in the consolidated financial statements on an undiscounted basis for loss contingencies related to legal actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount may be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and may be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed. When determining the estimated loss or range of loss, significant judgment is required. Estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation  and  governmental proceedings involving the  Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages with incomplete scientific facts or legal discovery, involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages, potentially involve penalties, fines or punitive damages, or could result in a change in business practice. The Company classifies certain specified litigation charges and gains related to significant legal matters as certain litigation charges in the consolidated statements of income. During fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company recognized $149 million of certain litigation charges, $30 million of certain litigation income, and $95 million of certain litigation charges, respectively. At April 26, 2024 and April 28, 2023, accrued litigation was approximately $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively. The ultimate cost to the Company with respect to accrued litigation could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse impact on the Company's consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows. The Company includes accrued litigation in other accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. While it is not possible to predict the outcome for most of the legal matters discussed below, the Company believes it is possible that the costs associated with these matters could have a material adverse impact on the Company's consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows.\n\n## Intellectual Property Matters\n\nAt any given time, the  Company is involved in litigation relating to patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other intellectual property (IP) rights, and licenses, acquisitions or other agreements relating to such rights. This litigation includes, but is not limited to, alleged infringement or misappropriation of IP rights, or breach  of  obligations  related  to  IP  rights,  or  other  claims  asserted  by  competitors,  individuals,  or,  consistent  with  a  growing  trend  across  technology-intensive industries, other entities created specifically to fund IP litigation. While the outcome of these litigation matters is inherently uncertain, it is possible that the results of such litigation could require the Company to pay significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, and negatively impact the Company's ability to sell current or future products, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\n\n## Colibri\n\nThe Company is a defendant in patent litigation brought by Colibri Heart V alve LLC (Colibri) in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Colibri alleges infringement of one patent by the Company's Evolut family of transcatheter aortic valve replacement devices. The patent asserted by Colibri has expired. On February 8, 2023, a jury returned a verdict against the Company for approximately $106 million. In July 2023, the Company filed its appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Company has not recognized an expense in connection with this matter because it does not currently believe a loss is probable.\n\n## Product Liability Matters\n\n## Hernia Mesh Litigation\n\nStarting in fiscal year 2020, plaintiffs began filing lawsuits against certain subsidiaries of the Company in U.S. state and federal courts that allege personal injury from hernia mesh products sold by those subsidiaries. As of May 15, 2024, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in lawsuits filed on behalf of approximately 8,350 individual plaintiffs, and certain plaintiffs'",

The Company expects these supply chain actions will include expanding its use of strategic collaborations, and bolstering its initiatives to reduce complexity, improving cost-competitiveness, enhancing capabilities and optimizing its network.  Discussions regarding specific future actions are ongoing and are subject to all relevant consultation requirements before they are finalized. In total, the Company expects these actions to generate approximately $0.6 to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by the end of 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $2.1 to $2.3 billion. The Company estimates that approximately 70% of the cumulative pre-tax costs will result in cash outlays. In 2021, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.5 billion, which is included on the following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $0.3 billion in restructuring, $0.1 billion in other (income) expense and $0.1 billion in cost of products sold.

          "chunk_text": "## A portion of AbbVie's near-term pharmaceutical pipeline relies on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sale of its products.\n\nAbbVie depends on alliances and joint ventures with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for a portion of the products in its near-term pharmaceutical pipeline. Failures by these parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, or other obligations to AbbVie, or any disruption in the relationships between AbbVie and these third parties, could have an adverse effect on AbbVie's pharmaceutical pipeline and business. In addition, AbbVie's collaborative relationships for research and development extend for many years and may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights, obligations and revenues of AbbVie and its collaboration partners, including the ownership of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations. Such disputes could result in AbbVie's loss of intellectual property rights or protection, delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products, affect the effective sale and delivery of AbbVie's commercialized products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation, administrative proceedings or arbitration.\n\n## Biologics carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a negative impact on AbbVie's business and results of operations.\n\nThe successful discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is a long, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and uncertainties with biologics. For example, access to and supply of necessary biological materials, such as cell lines, may be limited and current governmental regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such materials. In addition, the development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is subject to regulations that are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. As a result, manufacturing biologics, especially in large quantities, is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies. Such manufacturing also requires facilities specifically designed and validated for this purpose and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures. Biologics are also frequently costly to manufacture because production inputs are derived from living animal or plant material, and some biologics cannot be made synthetically. Failure to successfully discover, develop, manufacture and sell biologics-including Humira, Skyrizi, Botox and Creon -could have a negative impact on AbbVie's business and results of operations.\n\n## New products and technological advances by AbbVie's competitors may negatively affect AbbVie's results of operations.\n\nAbbVie competes with other research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that research, develop, manufacture, market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics. All of these competitors may introduce new products or develop technological advances that compete with AbbVie's products in therapeutic areas such as immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care. In addition, as AbbVie products lose exclusivity, competition surrounding such products will increase and generic and biosimilar products will increasingly penetrate the markets. Furthermore, consolidation among certain pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can enhance such advantages. These advantages may make it difficult for us to compete with them successfully to discover, develop and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or indications they may bring to market. AbbVie cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction by competitors of new products or technological advances. Such competing products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, have lower prices or better insurance coverage or reimbursement levels, or have superior performance features than AbbVie's products, and this may negatively impact AbbVie's business and results of operations.\n\n## The manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex process requiring critical environmental controls, and if AbbVie or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing AbbVie's products, AbbVie's business could suffer.\n\nThe manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, delays related to the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities, including those intended to support future demand for AbbVie's products, changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, changes in the types of products produced, physical limitations that could inhibit continuous supply, labor shortages, supply chain disruption, pandemics, man-made or natural disasters and environmental factors. If problems arise during the production of a batch of product, such batch of product may have to be discarded and AbbVie may experience product shortages or incur added expenses. This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, ti me and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred.\n\n17\n\n",

See Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.\n\nWe currently perform a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing that supports our product candidates at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California. A substantial  disruption  in  our  ability  to  operate  our  Thousand  Oaks  manufacturing  facility  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  our  ability  to  supply  our  product candidates for use in our clinical trials, leading to delays in development of our product candidates.\n\nIn addition, we currently perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. In recent years, Puerto Rico has been affected by a number of natural disasters, including Hurricanes Maria (2017) and Fiona (2022), as well as earthquakes (2020). These natural disasters have affected, and may continue to affect, public and private properties and Puerto Rico's electric grid and communications networks. While the critical manufacturing areas of our commercial manufacturing facility were not significantly affected by these natural disasters, the restoration of electrical service on the island after Hurricane Maria was a slow process, and our facility relied on backup diesel powered generators for some time. We also operated on backup generators for a few weeks after the early 2020 earthquakes in Puerto Rico. In 2021, the baseload power generation units of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority malfunctioned, leading to selective outages across the island. In September 2022, Hurricane Fiona caused further damage to the island's utility infrastructure which again resulted in widespread power outages and water supply issues. On December 31, 2024, an island-wide power outage also required that we operate on backup generators. Although these events did not directly have a material effect on our business, they have resulted in disruptions to our third-party suppliers on the island. Further instability of the electric grid could require us to increase our use of our generators or to use them exclusively. In addition, future storms,",

          "chunk_text": "| Description of the Matter                | As of December 31, 2024, the Company recorded accrued sales deductions of $8.4 billion. As described in Note 1 to the financial statements under the caption 'Product sales and sales deductions,' revenues from product sales are recognized net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, discounts and other deductions (collectively sales deductions), which are established at the time of sale. Auditing the estimation of sales deductions, specifically estimated chargebacks, commercial rebates, and Medicaid rebates related to U.S. product sales, which are netted against product sales, is complex, requires significant judgment, and the amounts involved are material to the financial statements taken as a whole. Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of a product to a customer, generally upon delivery, and is based on an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled, which represents an amount that is net of accruals for estimated sales deductions. The estimated sales deductions are based on current contractual and statutory requirements, market events and trends, internal and external historical data, and forecasted customer buying patterns.   |\n|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the sales deduction processes. This included testing controls over management's review of significant assumptions and inputs used in the estimate of sales deductions, including actual sales, contractual terms, historical experience, wholesaler inventory levels, demand data and estimated patient population. We also tested management's controls over the accuracy of forecasting demand activity as well as the completeness and accuracy of the significant components included in the final sales deduction estimates. To test management's estimated sales deductions, we obtained management's calculations for the respective estimates and performed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |",

      "answer": "AbbVie expenses development milestone payments related to licensing rights immediately upon achievement of the milestone, as part of acquired IPR&D and milestones expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. In contrast, Amgen records contingent consideration obligations tied to licensing rights at fair value using probability-adjusted discounted cash flows and revalues them each reporting period until contingencies are resolved, with changes in fair value recognized in Other operating expenses.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From AbbVie's 2024 10-K, we learn that development milestone payments made prior to regulatory approval under licensing arrangements are expensed immediately to 'acquired IPR&D and milestones expense' when the milestone results are achieved.",
        "Step 2: From Amgen's 2024 10-K, we learn that contingent consideration obligations related to licensing rights are initially recorded at fair value using probability-adjusted discounted cash flows and are revalued each reporting period with changes recognized in 'Other operating expenses'.",
        "Step 3: Comparing these two approaches reveals a key difference in financial treatment: AbbVie recognizes the full expense at the point of milestone achievement, while Amgen spreads the financial impact through periodic revaluations until contingencies are resolved."

For each type of rebate, factors used in the calculation of the accrual include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant.\n\nIn addition to revenue from contracts with customers, the company also recognizes certain collaboration revenues. See Note 6 for additional information related to the collaborations with Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Genentech, Inc. Additionally, see Note 16 for disaggregation of revenue by product and geography.\n\n## Research and Development Expenses\n\nInternal R&amp;D costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical trial costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed.\n\n## Acquired IPR&amp;D and Milestones Expenses\n\nIn an asset acquisition, payments incurred prior to regulatory approval to acquire rights to in-process R&amp;D projects are expensed as acquired IPR&amp;D and milestones expense in the consolidated statements of earnings unless the project has an alternative future use. These costs include upfront and development milestone payments related to R&amp;D collaborations, licensing arrangements, or other asset acquisitions that provide rights to develop, manufacture and/or sell pharmaceutical products. Where contingent development milestone payments are due to third parties, prior to regulatory approval, the payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved. Regulatory and commercial milestone payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the remaining useful life of the related product.\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nAbbVie utilizes the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. This method requires, among other things, that results of operations of acquired companies are included in AbbVie's results of operations beginning on the acquisition date and that assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. Contingent consideration liabilities are recognized at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are recognized in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. The fair value of assets acquired and l i a bi l i ti es  a s s umed i n certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair value during a period of time not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date. Legal costs, due diligence costs, business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred.\n\nIn a business combination, the fair value of IPR&amp;D projects acquired is capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until the underlying project receives regulatory approval, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite-lived intangible asset, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. R&amp;D costs incurred by the company after the acquisition are expensed to R&amp;D as incurred.\n\n## Collaborations and Other Arrangements\n\nThe company enters into collaborative agreements with third parties to develop and commercialize drug candidates. Collaborative activities may include j oi nt research and development and commercialization of new products. AbbVie generally receives certain licensing rights under these arrangements. These collaborations often require upfront payments and may include additional milestone, research and development cost sharing, royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development and commercialization. Upfront payments associated with collaborative arrangements and subsequent payments made to the partner for the achievement of development milestones prior to regulatory approval are expensed to acquired IPR&amp;D and milestones expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. Regulatory and commercial milestone payments made to the partner subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Royalties are expensed to cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings when incurred.\n\n## Advertising\n\nCosts associated with advertising are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. Advertising expenses were $2.1 billion in 2024, $2.2 billion in 2023 and $2.0 billion in 2022.\n\n## 57 | 2024 Form 10-K",

We estimate the fair values of these contracts by taking into consideration valuations obtained from a third-party valuation service that uses an income-based industry-standard valuation model for which all significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly. These inputs, as applicable, include foreign currency exchange rates, SOFR, swap rates, obligor credit default swap rates and cross-currency basis swap spreads. Certain inputs, when applicable, are at commonly quoted intervals. See Note 19, Derivative instruments.\n\n## Contingent consideration obligations\n\nAs a result of our business acquisitions, we have incurred contingent consideration obligations as discussed below. The contingent consideration obligations are recorded at their fair values by using probability-adjusted discounted cash flows, and we revalue these obligations each reporting period until the related contingencies have been resolved. The fair value measurements of these obligations are based on significant unobservable inputs related to licensing rights and product candidates acquired in business combinations, and they are reviewed quarterly by management in our R&amp;D and commercial sales organizations. The inputs include, as applicable, estimated probabilities and the timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones as well as estimated annual sales. Significant changes that increase or decrease the probabilities of achieving the related development, regulatory and commercial events or that shorten or lengthen the time required to achieve such events or that increase or decrease estimated annual sales would result in corresponding increases or decreases in the fair values of the obligations, as applicable.

Amgen, on the other hand, capitalizes payments for milestones related to regulatory approvals and upfront payments tied to royalty obligations under licensing rights, treating them as long-term intangible assets.

      "question": "How does AbbVie's expensing of development milestone payments prior to regulatory approval, such as those potentially received by Amgen as part of collaborative arrangements, affect the financial treatment and reporting of R&D expenses and collaboration revenues in their respective financial statements?",
      "answer": "AbbVie expenses development milestone payments related to in-process R&D collaborations, such as those potentially paid to Amgen, as acquired IPR&D and milestones expense in the consolidated statements of earnings when the milestone results are achieved, prior to regulatory approval. In contrast, Amgen recognizes such milestone payments as collaboration revenue when it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue will not occur, particularly in arrangements with multiple performance obligations. This creates a direct financial linkage: AbbVie's R&D expense increases in the period the milestone is achieved, while Amgen reports a corresponding increase in collaboration revenue, highlighting the synchronized yet opposite financial impact of these contingent milestone payments in their respective income statements.",

For each type of rebate, factors used in the calculation of the accrual include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant.\n\nIn addition to revenue from contracts with customers, the company also recognizes certain collaboration revenues. See Note 6 for additional information related to the collaborations with Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Genentech, Inc. Additionally, see Note 16 for disaggregation of revenue by product and geography.\n\n## Research and Development Expenses\n\nInternal R&amp;D costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical trial costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed.\n\n## Acquired IPR&amp;D and Milestones Expenses\n\nIn an asset acquisition, payments incurred prior to regulatory approval to acquire rights to in-process R&amp;D projects are expensed as acquired IPR&amp;D and milestones expense in the consolidated statements of earnings unless the project has an alternative future use. These costs include upfront and development milestone payments related to R&amp;D collaborations, licensing arrangements, or other asset acquisitions that provide rights to develop, manufacture and/or sell pharmaceutical products. Where contingent development milestone payments are due to third parties, prior to regulatory approval, the payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved. Regulatory and commercial milestone payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the remaining useful life of the related product.\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nAbbVie utilizes the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. This method requires, among other things, that results of operations of acquired companies are included in AbbVie's results of operations beginning on the acquisition date and that assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. Contingent consideration liabilities are recognized at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are recognized in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. The fair value of assets acquired and l i a bi l i ti es  a s s umed i n certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair value during a period of time not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date. Legal costs, due diligence costs, business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred.\n\nIn a business combination, the fair value of IPR&amp;D projects acquired is capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until the underlying project receives regulatory approval, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite-lived intangible asset, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. R&amp;D costs incurred by the company after the acquisition are expensed to R&amp;D as incurred.\n\n## Collaborations and Other Arrangements\n\nThe company enters into collaborative agreements with third parties to develop and commercialize drug candidates. Collaborative activities may include j oi nt research and development and commercialization of new products. AbbVie generally receives certain licensing rights under these arrangements. These collaborations often require upfront payments and may include additional milestone, research and development cost sharing, royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development and commercialization. Upfront payments associated with collaborative arrangements and subsequent payments made to the partner for the achievement of development milestones prior to regulatory approval are expensed to acquired IPR&amp;D and milestones expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. Regulatory and commercial milestone payments made to the partner subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Royalties are expensed to cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings when incurred.\n\n## Advertising\n\nCosts associated with advertising are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. Advertising expenses were $2.1 billion in 2024, $2.2 billion in 2023 and $2.0 billion in 2022.\n\n## 57 | 2024 Form 10-K",

          "chunk_text": "## Other revenues\n\nOther revenues consist primarily of royalty income and corporate partner revenues. Royalties from licensees are based on third-party sales of licensed products and are recorded when the related third-party product sale occurs. Royalty income is estimated based on historical and forecasted sales trends. Corporate partner revenues are  composed  mainly  of  license  fees  and  milestones  earned  and  our  share  of  commercial  profits  generated  from  collaborations.  See Arrangements  with  multipleperformance obligations, discussed below.\n\n## Arrangements with multiple-performance obligations\n\nFrom time to time, we enter into arrangements for the R&amp;D, manufacture and/or commercialization of products and product candidates. Such arrangements may require us to deliver various rights, services and/or goods, including intellectual property rights/licenses, R&amp;D services, manufacturing services and/or commercialization services. The underlying terms of these arrangements generally provide for consideration to Amgen in the form of nonrefundable, upfront license fees; development and commercial-performance milestone payments; royalty payments; and/or profit sharing.\n\nIn arrangements involving more than one performance obligation, each required performance obligation is evaluated to determine whether it qualifies as a distinct performance obligation based on whether (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and (ii) the good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The consideration under the arrangement is then allocated to each separate distinct performance obligation based on its respective relative stand-alone selling price. The estimated selling price of each deliverable reflects our best estimate of what the selling price would be if the deliverable was regularly sold by us on a stand-alone basis or by using an adjusted market assessment approach if selling price on a stand-alone basis is not available.\n\nThe  consideration  allocated  to  each  distinct  performance  obligation  is  recognized  as  revenue  when  control  of  the  related  goods  or  services  is  transferred. Consideration associated with at-risk substantive performance milestones is recognized as revenue when it is probable that a significant reversal of the cumulative revenue recognized will  not  occur.  We  utilize  the  sales-  and  usage-based  royalty  ex ception  in  arrangements  that  resulted  from  the  license  of  intellectual  property, recognizing revenues generated from royalties or profit sharing as the underlying sales occur.\n\n## Research and development costs\n\nR&amp;D costs are expensed as incurred and primarily include salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs; facilities and overhead costs; clinical trial and related clinical  manufacturing  costs;  contract  services  and  other  outside  costs;  information  systems'  costs;  and  amortization  of  acquired  technology  used  in  R&amp;D  with alternative future uses. R&amp;D expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with third-party R&amp;D arrangements, including upfront fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies that had not reached technological feasibility and did not have an alternative future use. Net payment or reimbursement of R&amp;D costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or as we become entitled to the cost recovery. See Note 9, Collaborations.\n\n## Selling, general and administrative costs\n\nSG&amp;A costs are primarily composed of salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal and other administrative personnel;  facilities  and  overhead  costs;  outside  marketing,  advertising  and  legal  ex penses;  the  U.S.  healthcare  reform  federal  ex cise  fee  on  Branded  Prescription Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Importers; and other general and administrative costs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were $987 million, $647 million and $841  million  during  the  years  ended  December  31,  2024,  2023  and  2022,  respectively.  SG &amp;A  ex penses  also  include  costs  and  cost  recoveries  associated  with marketing and promotion efforts under certain collaborative arrangements. Net payment or reimbursement of SG &amp;A costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or we become entitled to the cost recovery. See Note 9, Collaborations.\n\n## Leases\n\nAt inception of a contract,  we  determine  whether  an  arrangement  is  or  contains  a  lease.  For  all  leases,  we  determine  the  classification  as  either  operating  or financing. Operating leases are included in Other noncurrent assets, Accrued liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments under the lease. Lease recognition occurs at the commencement date, and lease liability amounts are based on the present value of lease payments made during the lease term. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate a lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Because most of our leases do not provide information to determine an implicit interest rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of",

      "question": "How might Amgen's acquisition-related debt and integration challenges impact its R&D investment strategy compared to Danaher's approach to funding product innovation in the healthcare/life sciences sector?",
      "answer": "Amgen's acquisition of Horizon, financed by $24 billion in senior notes and $4 billion drawn from a term loan facility, has led to downgrades in its credit ratings and could limit its ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms. This substantial increase in indebtedness may constrain Amgen\u2019s capacity to allocate capital toward research and development activities, particularly given the complexities and unanticipated costs associated with integrating Horizon\u2019s operations, including its research, development, and commercial infrastructure. In contrast, Danaher explicitly states that it expenses research and development costs as incurred, indicating a more direct and consistent investment approach toward innovation. Danaher\u2019s strategy allows for immediate recognition of R&D expenses, potentially signaling a prioritization of innovation with fewer financial constraints compared to Amgen, which faces integration risks and higher debt that could divert resources from R&D. Therefore, Amgen may face greater financial pressure in sustaining R&D investments at the same level as Danaher, which maintains a more predictable and expensed-based model for product development.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Amgen incurred $24 billion in senior notes and $4 billion in term loan drawdowns to finance the Horizon acquisition, which led to credit rating downgrades and potential limitations on future financing.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Danaher expenses research and development costs as incurred, showing a direct and consistent investment in product innovation.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Amgen\u2019s increased debt and integration challenges may constrain its ability to invest in R&D, whereas Danaher\u2019s expensed-based R&D model allows for more predictable and immediate investment in innovation."

      "answer": "DHR reflects an income tax impact of $2 million related to the reclassification of remeasurement of long-term debt. Amgen uses an estimated effective tax rate to assess the income tax impact of acquisition-related adjustments in its unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information. While DHR's impact is a realized figure tied to a specific event, Amgen's approach is forward-looking and applied to a broader set of adjustments, including intangible assets and interest expenses, without specifying a concrete dollar amount.",

        "Step 1: From DHR's 10-K filing, the income tax impact of $2 million is explicitly mentioned in relation to the remeasurement of long-term debt.",

        "Step 3: The comparison is drawn by analyzing the specificity of DHR's income tax impact versus Amgen's more generalized application of an effective tax rate to its acquisition adjustments."

These surveys cover a broad range of topics including development and opportunities, recognition, performance, belonging, well-being, compliance, and continuous improvement. In 2024, we conducted engagement surveys in both April and September. More than 150,000 colleagues participated in each survey and overall engagement stayed consistent across surveys.\n\nThe Board, our Chief Executive Officer ('CEO') and our Chief People Officer provide oversight of our human capital strategy, which consists of the following categories: workforce strategy; total rewards; and health, safety and environment.\n\n## Workforce Strategy\n\nAt CVS Health, our goal is to attract the most talented and qualified workforce in health care and to develop and retain a work force to support and advance our strategic priorities. We believe that our workforce strategy should be responsive to and reflect the broad and diverse communities whose health care needs we serve.\n\nWe are committed to developing a pipeline of critical skills to power CVS Health for the future. We partner with colleges and universities across many professional fields. For ex ample, the CV S Health PharmD tuition assistance program is available to all eligible CV S Pharmacy interns. In addition, CV S Health is creating transformational solutions to workforce development through dynamic community Workforce Innovation and Talent Centers (WITCs), tailored to the specific needs of each community, incorporating education and skill development, as we help advance future leaders.\n\nTraining and development provide colleagues the support they need to perform well in their current roles while planning and preparing for future roles and career growth. Our broad training practices include updated, tech-enabled tools and keep our colleagues informed of new developments in our industry that are relevant to their roles. During the year ended December 31, 2024, our colleagues invested approximately 16 million hours in learning and development courses.\n\nRespect is a cornerstone of our culture, and a centerpiece of our workplace strategy. To do our best when people need us the most means we strive every day to achieve the highest level of trust and respect from our colleagues, our customers, and our communities. Our Heart At Work behaviors are guiding principles for how we lead. We emphasize trust, collaboration, and innovation. Those aspects of our culture show up in our Respect Works Here campaign.\n\nOur comprehensive and well-executed workforce practices have allowed us to be recognized as a VETSIndexes 3-Star Employer and to earn a 100 percent score on the Disability Equality Index, meaning the Company is recognized as a 'Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion'.\n\nWe disclose more information on our workforce strategy in our annual Impact Report.\n\n## Total Rewards\n\nWe strive to offer a comprehensive and competitive mix of pay and benefits to meet the varying needs of our colleagues and their families. In addition to competitive wages, the comprehensive list of programs and benefits we offer include annual bonuses, stock awards, 401(k) plans including matching company contributions, no cost comprehensive wellness screenings, tobacco cessation and weight management programs, no cost confidential counseling and no cost financial navigation support, an employee stock purchase plan, health care and insurance benefits, paid time off, flexible work schedules, family leave, dependent care resources, colleague assistance programs and tuition assistance, retiree medical access, and discount programs, among many others, depending on eligibility.\n\n## Health, Safety and Environment\n\nWe have a strong commitment to providing a safe working environment. We have implemented an environmental health and safety management system to support adherence and monitoring of programs designed to make our various business operations compliant with applicable occupational safety and health regulations and requirements. Our Health, Safety, and Environment Department oversees the implementation and adherence to programs like powered industrial truck training, materials handling and storage, selection of personal protective equipment and fall protection systems.\n\nWe utilize a Management Information System to track compliance, analyze data and concentrate on key areas of risk to reduce the chance of workplace incidents. We focus on identifying causes and improving performance when workplace incidents occur.

For our future products, we continue to develop additional manufacturing capabilities and establish additional third-party suppliers to manufacture sufficient quantities of our product candidates to undertake clinical trials and to manufacture sufficient quantities of any product that is approved for commercial sale.\n\nFor more information, see 'G overnment Regulation' section below and Item 1A. Risk Factors 'We may not be able to obtain materials or supplies necessary to conduct  clinical  trials  or  to  manufacture  and  sell  our  products,  or  we  may  face  manufacturing  difficulties,  delays  or  interruptions,  including  at  our  third-party manufacturers and corporate partners, which could limit our ability to generate revenues.'\n\n## Human Capital\n\nGilead's success depends on the work of its dedicated employees who embrace a shared sense of purpose and a culture of excellence. Our human capital objective is to make G ilead an employer of choice for the best talent in our industry. G ilead's key priorities for human capital management include inclusion, total rewards, safety, and employee development and engagement initiatives and programs. The Compensation and Talent Committee of our Board of Directors oversees our overall human capital management.\n\nFor risks associated with our human capital, see Item 1A. Risk Factors 'Due to the specialized and technical nature of our business, the failure to attract, develop and retain highly qualified personnel could adversely impact us.'\n\n## Inclusion\n\nGilead is an equal opportunity employer and is committed to inclusive practices, which are integral to G ilead's culture and business. We approach inclusion from the standpoint of it being a business imperative that is critical to hiring  the  very  best  talent,  understanding  the  patients  and  communities  we  serve,  and conducting science-based clinical trials focused on patient populations that represent the diseases being studied. We have a long-standing commitment to creating a safe, respectful and welcoming environment for all employees, which aligns with our core values of integrity, inclusion, teamwork, accountability and excellence. Gilead serves a wide range of patients and communities around the world, and they are best supported by a workforce that can understand and innovate to meet their unique  needs.  Ultimately,  a  workforce  with  different  lived  ex periences,  perspectives  and  backgrounds  is  imperative  to  advancing  health  and  delivering transformational medicines for patients worldwide.\n\nOur inclusion council ('Council') is responsible for governance of our inclusion strategy and our efforts to promote a culture of inclusion and belonging in a sustainable and compliant way. The Council includes senior executives and leaders from our employee resource groups ('ERG s'). In addition, our ERG s, which are open to all, support employees and aim to raise awareness of different cultures within the workplace and cultivate the variety of lived experiences, perspectives and backgrounds as a business strength. Executive sponsors and leaders of our ERG s contribute to the advancement of our inclusion priorities through annual planning and collaborative efforts to support our communities inside and outside of Gilead.\n\nGilead's commitment to equal employment opportunity furthers its efforts to cultivate and celebrate a culture of belonging.

These penalties could include fines, payment withholdings, contract terminations, or enrollment restrictions, which could materially affect its operating results and cash flows. GILD, on the other hand, faces civil monetary penalties from the FDA for non-compliance with manufacturing, safety reporting, or promotional regulations. These could result in product recalls, approval delays, or suspension of regulatory approvals, which could increase manufacturing costs, cause revenue losses, and damage its reputation.

          "chunk_text": "The Company's Medicaid, dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan products also are heavily regulated by CMS and state Medicaid agencies, which have the right to audit the Company's performance to determine compliance with CMS contracts and regulations. The Company's Medicaid products, dual eligible products and CHIP contracts also are subject to complex federal and state regulations and oversight by state Medicaid agencies regarding the services provided to Medicaid enrollees, payment for those services, network requirements (including mandatory inclusion of specified high-cost providers), and other aspects of these programs, and by external review organizations which audit Medicaid plans on behalf of state Medicaid agencies. The laws, regulations and contractual requirements applicable to the Company and other participants in Medicaid and dual eligible programs, including requirements that the Company submit encounter data to the applicable state agency, are extensive, complex and subject to change. For example, in April 2024, CMS finalized the Managed Care Rule, which addresses five primary areas: (1) access in managed care, including network adequacy; (2) state directed payments; (3) medical loss ratio standards; (4) in lieu of services and settings and (5) quality and performance assessment. The Company has invested significant resources to comply with these standards, and its Medicaid and dual eligible program compliance efforts will continue to require significant resources. CMS and/or state Medicaid agencies may fine the Company, withhold payments to the Company, seek premium and other refunds, terminate the Company's existing contracts, elect not to award the Company new contracts or not to renew the Company's existing contracts, prohibit the Company from continuing to market and/or enroll members in or refuse to automatically assign members to one or more of the Company's Medicaid or dual eligible products, exclude the Company from participating in one or more Medicaid or dual eligible programs and/or institute other sanctions and/or civil monetary penalties against the Company if it fails to comply with CMS or state regulations or contractual requirements. CMS has proposed requiring that health plans offering certain dual eligible programs must also offer Medicaid programs, which has resulted in the Company refraining from bidding in certain jurisdictions and could impact the Company's ability to obtain or retain membership in its dual eligible programs.\n\nThe Company cannot predict whether pending or future federal or state legislation or court proceedings will change various aspects of the Medicaid program, nor can it predict the impact those changes will have on its business operations or operating results, but the effects could be materially adverse.\n\nMedicare and Medicaid Audits - CMS regularly audits the Company's performance to determine its compliance with CMS' regulations and its contracts with CMS and to assess the quality of services it provides to Medicare Advantage and PDP beneficiaries. For example, CMS conducts risk adjustment data validation ('RADV') audits of a subset of Medicare Advantage contracts for each contract year. Since 2011, CMS has selected certain of the Company's Medicare Advantage contracts for various years for RADV audit, and the number of RADV audits continues to increase. The OIG also is auditing the Company's risk adjustment data and that of other companies, and the Company expects CMS and the OIG to continue auditing risk adjustment data. The Company also has received Civil Investigative Demands ('CIDs') from, and provided documents and information to, the Civil Division of the DOJ in connection with investigations of the Company's identification and/or submission of diagnosis codes related to risk adjustment payments, including patient chart review processes, under Parts C and D of the Medicare program.\n\nOn January 30, 2023, CMS released the final rule concerning Part C contract-level Risk Adjustment Data Validation Audits (the 'RADV Audit Rule'). The RADV Audit Rule eliminated the application of a fee-for-service adjuster ('FFS Adjuster') in contract-level RADV audits but continued the use of extrapolation in such audits of Medicare Advantage organizations. The FFS Adjuster that was announced in 2012 was to be used by CMS to determine a permissible level of payment error. By applying the FFS Adjuster, Medicare Advantage organizations would have been liable for repayments only to the extent that their extrapolated payment errors ex ceeded the error rate in Original Medicare, which could have impacted the extrapolated repayments to which Medicare Advantage organizations are subject. CMS is conducting RADV audits of Medicare Advantage organizations, including the Company's Medicare Advantage plans, for payment year 2018 and subsequent payment years and may use extrapolation without the application of a FFS Adjuster. The RADV Audit Rule may have potential adverse effects, which could be material, on the Company's operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. CMS also has announced that it will not conduct RADV audits on all contracts; instead, it will only audit contracts it believes are at the highest risk for overpayments based on its statistical modeling. The RADV Audit Rule is subject to ongoing litigation and the outcome and future impacts are uncertain.\n\nIn addition, state Medicaid agencies regularly audit, and state Attorneys General regularly investigate, the Company's performance across all areas of its contractual obligations to the state to determine compliance and quality of services. The Company may be subject to, among other penalties, significant fines, sanctions, corrective actions, and enrollment freezes depending on the findings of these audits and reviews. The Company's ongoing performance and compliance with program requirements can impact our ability to expand and retain Medicaid business. State Medicaid agencies are also increasingly using the audit process to challenge the legality of PBM practices, such as guaranteed effective rate reconciliations with retail pharmacies and transmission fees.",

          "chunk_text": "Any adverse developments affecting or resulting from any single entity within our manufacturing operations or the operations of our CMOs and corporate partners can result in shipment delays, inventory shortages, lot failures, product withdrawals or recalls or other interruptions in the development and commercial supply of our products, which may result in us not being able to generate sufficient quantities of clinical or commercial product to meet market demand and may cause delays in our clinical trials and applications for regulatory approval.  We have incurred, and will continue to incur, inventory write-off charges and other expenses for products that fail to meet specifications and quality standards as well as changes we may adopt in our manufacturing strategy, and we may need to undertake costly remediation efforts or seek more costly manufacturing alternatives. Such developments could increase our manufacturing costs, cause us to lose revenues or market share and damage our reputation. Our business may be adversely affected if approval of any of our product candidates were delayed or if production of our products were interrupted.\n\n## Regulatory and Other Legal Risks\n\nOur operations depend on compliance with complex FDA and comparable international regulations. Failure to obtain broad approvals on a timely basis or to maintain compliance, including if significant safety issues arise for our marketed products or our product candidates, could delay or halt commercialization of our products.\n\nThe products we develop must be approved for marketing and sale by regulatory authorities and, once approved, are subject to extensive regulation by FDA, EMA and comparable regulatory agencies in other countries. We have filed, and anticipate that we will continue to file, for marketing approval in additional countries and for additional indications and products. These and any future marketing applications we file may not be approved by the regulatory authorities on a timely basis, or at all.  For  ex ample,  in  October  2022,  we  announced that  FDA issued a complete response letter for our  Biologics  License Application for bulevirtide for the treatment of adults with hepatitis delta virus infection. Even if marketing approval is granted for our product candidates, there may be significant limitations on their use. We cannot state with certainty when or whether any of our product candidates under development will be approved or launched; whether we will be able to develop, license or acquire additional product candidates or products; or whether any products, once launched, will be commercially successful.\n\nFurther, how we manufacture and sell our products is subject to extensive regulation and review. For example, under FDA rules, we are often required to conduct post-approval clinical studies to assess a known serious risk, signals of serious risk or to identify an unexpected serious risk. In certain circumstances, we may be required to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program for our products, which could include a medication guide, patient package insert, a communication plan to healthcare providers, restrictions on distribution or use of a product and other elements FDA deems necessary to assure safe use of the drug. Discovery of previously unknown problems with our marketed products or product candidates, including serious safety, resistance or drug interaction issues, or problems with our manufacturing, safety reporting or promotional activities, may result in regulatory approvals being delayed, denied or granted with significant restrictions on our products, including limitations on or the withdrawal of the products from the market.\n\nAs additional studies are conducted after obtaining marketing approval for our products, and as our products are used over longer periods of time by many patients, including patients with underlying health problems or those taking other medicines, we expect to continue finding new issues related to safety, resistance or drug interactions. Any such issues may require changes to our product labels, such as additional warnings, contraindications or even narrowed indications, or the halt of product sales.\n\nRegulatory  authorities  have  been  moving  towards  more  active  and  transparent  pharmacovigilance  and  are  making  greater  amounts  of  stand-alone  safety information  and  clinical  trial  data  directly  available  to  the  public  through  websites  and  other  means,  such  as  periodic  safety  update  report  summaries,  risk management plan summaries and various adverse event data. Safety information, without the appropriate context and expertise, may be misinterpreted and lead to misperception or legal action.\n\nFailure  to  comply  with  these  or  other  requirements  imposed  by  FDA  could  result  in  significant  civil  monetary  penalties,  fines,  suspensions  of  regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products and criminal prosecutions.",

      "answer": "TMO reduced its short-term obligations by $1,970 million (from $5,579 million in 2022 to $3,609 million in 2023), indicating a strategy of debt reduction and improved liquidity positioning. In contrast, UNH relied on significant cash inflows from regulated subsidiaries\u2014$8.0 billion in 2023\u2014to meet short-term obligations, suggesting a strategy of leveraging internal cash flows rather than reducing debt directly. These approaches reflect differing liquidity strategies: TMO focused on lowering liabilities, while UNH maintained access to cash through subsidiary distributions.",

      "answer": "In 2023, TMO experienced an increase in segment income margin due to a favorable business mix, which helped offset the decline in revenues from lower COVID-19 testing volume. Meanwhile, UNH saw an increase in its MCR (Medical Cost Ratio) as a result of business mix changes and elevated care activity, particularly in outpatient care for seniors. These effects show that while a favorable business mix positively impacted TMO's profitability, an unfavorable shift in business mix contributed to higher medical costs for UNH.",

In contrast, Pfizer only mentions the existence of accruals for uncertain tax positions in a general list of tax assets and liabilities without providing specific amounts, methodologies, or management practices.

Additionally, the Company's tax returns are subject to audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities that could result in material adjustments based on differing interpretations of the tax laws.

The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the related tax authority.

          "chunk_text": "- the ongoing expansion of the Company's diagnostic testing program which began in April 2020, an immaterial impact from COVID-19 vaccinations which began in December 2020 and no OTC test kit sales.\n- Pharmacy same store sales increased 9.3% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was driven by the 9.3% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis and brand inflation. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.\n- Front store same store sales increased 7.6% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to strength in consumer health, including the sale of OTC test kits, as well as increased beauty and personal care sales in 2021.\n- Other revenues increased 94.0% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to increased COVID-19 diagnostic testing in 2021.\n\n## Store impairments\n\n- During 2021, the Company recorded a store impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion related to the write-down of operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the planned closure of approximately 900 retail stores between 2022 and 2024. See Note 6 ''Leases'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Goodwill impairment\n\n- During 2021, the Company recorded a $431 million goodwill impairment charge related to the LTC reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment. See Note 5 ''Goodwill and Other Intangibles'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Retail/LTC segment include store payroll, store employee benefits, store occupancy costs, selling expenses, advertising expenses, depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.\n- Operating expenses increased $1.9 billion, or 10.3%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to incremental costs associated with increased volume including COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, as well as increased investments in the segment's capabilities and colleague compensation and benefits. These increases were partially offset by gains from anti-trust legal settlements of $231 million recorded in 2021, the absence of incremental expenses associated with the Company's initial COVID-19 pandemic mitigation efforts incurred in 2020 and the impact of cost savings initiatives in 2021.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained relatively consistent at 20.1% and 20.0% in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.5 billion, or 24.0%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by the administration of COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, the increased prescription and front store volume described above, improved generic drug purchasing and gains from anti-trust legal settlements of $231 million recorded in 2021. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and increased investments in the segment's capabilities and colleague compensation and benefits.\n- As you review the Retail/LTC segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The segment's adjusted operating income benefited from the administration of COVID-19 vaccinations, diagnostic testing and OTC test kit sales which contributed approximately 30% of the segment's adjusted operating income in 2021.\n- The segment's adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix of business within the pharmacy portion of the Retail/LTC segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.\n- The increased use of generic drugs has positively impacted the segment's adjusted operating income but has resulted in third-party payors augmenting their efforts to reduce reimbursement payments to retail pharmacies for prescriptions. This trend, which the Company expects to continue, reduces the benefit the segment realizes from brand-to-generic drug conversions.\n\n## Prescriptions filled\n\n- Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Retail/LTC segment's pharmacies.

      "answer": "GILD reported a $226 million addition to goodwill from acquisitions in 2021, indicating active inorganic growth. CVS, which also pursues acquisitions as part of its growth strategy, explicitly discloses that unsuccessful integration of acquired companies could lead to goodwill impairment. If GILD faces similar integration challenges as those highlighted by CVS\u2014such as unanticipated liabilities, disruption of existing operations, or failure to realize expected synergies\u2014then the $226 million in goodwill it added could become impaired. This would result in a write-down, negatively affecting GILD\u2019s financial position. Therefore, the integration risks disclosed by CVS provide a cautionary context for how GILD\u2019s recent acquisition-related goodwill could pose a financial risk if integration efforts fall short of expectations.",

Challenges to our minimum MLR rebate methodology and/or reports could adversely affect our operating results.\n- Our operating results may be adversely affected by changes in laws and policies governing employers and by union organizing activity.\n\n## Risks Associated with Mergers, Acquisitions, and Divestitures\n\n- We may be unable to successfully integrate companies we acquire.\n- We expect to continue to pursue acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic alliances and other inorganic growth opportunities, which may be unsuccessful, cause us to assume unanticipated liabilities, disrupt our existing businesses, be dilutive or lead us to assume significant debt, among other things.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Operations\n\n- Failure to meet customer and investor expectations, including with respect to environmental, social and governance goals, may harm our brand and reputation, our ability to retain and grow our customer base and membership.\n- We and our vendors have experienced and continue to experience information security incidents. We can provide no assurance that we or our vendors will be able to contain detect or prevent incident.\n- Data governance failures or the failure or disruption of our information technology or infrastructure can adversely affect our reputation, businesses and prospects. Our use and disclosure of members', customers' and other constituents' sensitive information is subject to complex regulations at multiple levels.\n- Product liability, product recall or personal injury issues could damage our reputation.\n- We face significant competition in attracting and retaining talented employees. Further, managing succession for, and retention of, key executives is critical to our success.\n- Sales of our products and services are dependent on our ability to attract and motivate internal sales personnel and independent third-party brokers, consultants and agents. We may be subject to penalties or other regulatory actions as a result of the marketing practices of brokers and agents selling our products.\n- Failure of our businesses to effectively collaborate could prevent us from maximizing our operating results.\n- Pursuing multiple information technology improvement initiatives simultaneously could make continued development and implementation significantly more challenging.\n- We are subject to payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and disrupt our business operations.\n- Both our and our vendors' operations are subject to a variety of business continuity hazards and risks that could interrupt our operations or otherwise adversely affect our performance and operating results.\n\n## Financial Risks\n\n- We would be adversely affected by downgrades or potential downgrades in our credit ratings, should they occur, or if we do not effectively deploy our capital.\n- Goodwill and other intangible assets could, in the future, become impaired.",

We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service and Irish tax authorities for our 2016 to 2018 tax years.

We aim to attract, develop, retain and support a diverse workforce that reflects the many customers, patients, members and communities we serve. Our Diversity Management Leadership Council, a cross-functional group of senior leaders appointed by our CEO, works with our Strategic Diversity Management leadership team to intentionally embed diversity across all facets of our business. For our efforts, we have been recognized as a DiversityInc Top 50 Company, a LatinaStyle Top 50 Company for Latinas and earned a 100 percent score on both the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index as well as the Disability Equality Index, meaning the company is recognized as a 'Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion.' The Company discloses information on our diversity, equity and inclusion strategy and programs in our annual Corporate Social Responsibility ('CSR') Report.\n\nAs a foundation of diversity and inclusion, we continuously focus on increasing underrepresented populations across our business. In 2021, 71% of our total colleague population and 55% of our colleagues at the manager level and above self-reported as female. In addition, in 2021 our colleagues reported their race/ethnicity as: White (49%), Black/African American (17%), Hispanic/Latino (15%), Asian (11%) and Other (8%). The appendix to our CSR Report, our Strategic Diversity Management Report and our EEO-1 Employer Information Report include additional information on the diversity of our workforce.\n\nOur diversity management strategy emphasizes workplace representation, inclusion and belonging, talent acquisition and management and a diverse marketplace. We incorporated a diversity metric into our 2021 annual cash incentive program for our most senior leaders who have the greatest ability to influence the overall hiring, development and promotion of our colleagues. We also continued the deployment of conscious inclusion training for colleagues designed to enhance awareness of biases and support inclusive behaviors. Our CSR Report includes additional information with respect to our conscious inclusion training. We support 16 Colleague Resource Groups ('CRGs') that include more than 26,000 colleagues across the enterprise. These groups represent a wide range of professional, cultural, ethical and personal affinities and interests, as well as formal mentoring programs. Our CRGs provide our colleagues with an opportunity to connect and network with one another through a particular affinity, culture or interest. Each of our CRGs is sponsored by a senior leader.\n\n## Colleague Development\n\nThe Company offers a number of resources and programs that attract, engage, develop, advance and retain colleagues. Training and development provides colleagues the support they need to perform well in their current role while planning and preparing for future roles. We offer an online orientation program that pairs new hires with seasoned colleagues and the training continues throughout a colleague's career through in-person, virtual and self-paced learning at all levels. We also provide mentoring, tools and workshops for colleagues to manage their career development. We offer a variety of management and leadership programs that develop incumbent diverse and other high potential colleagues. Our broad training practices include updated, tech-enabled tools and keep our colleagues informed of new developments in our industry that are relevant to their roles. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our colleagues invested more than 13 million hours in learning and development courses.\n\nOur colleague development program also promotes the importance of compliance across our business. Our colleagues demonstrate this commitment through our annual Code of Conduct training, which 100% of active colleagues completed in 2021. In 2021, we launched more than 70 different training courses as part of our annual Enterprise Compliance Training Program.\n\n## Health &amp; Safety\n\nWe have a strong commitment to providing a safe working environment. We have implemented an environmental health and safety management system to support adherence and monitoring of programs designed to make our various business operations compliant with applicable occupational safety and health regulations and requirements. Our Environmental Health and Safety Department oversees the implementation and adherence to programs like Powered Industrial Truck training, materials handling and storage, selection of personal protective equipment and workplace violence prevention.\n\nWe utilize Safety Service Plans to analyze data and concentrate on key areas of risk to reduce the chance of workplace incidents. We focus on identifying causes and improving performance when workplace incidents occur. We also engage leaders",

For products manufactured by our third-party contract manufacturers, we have disclosed all necessary aspects of this technology to enable them to manufacture the products for us.  We  have  agreements  with  these  third-party  manufacturers  that  are  intended  to  restrict  them  from  using  or  revealing  this technology, but we cannot be certain that these third-party manufacturers will comply with these restrictions.\n\nFor  more  information  about  our  third-party  manufacturers,  see  Item  1A  Risk  Factors  'We  may  face  manufacturing difficulties, delays or interruptions, including at our third-party manufacturers and corporate partners.'\n\n## Regulation of Manufacturing Process\n\nThe manufacturing process for pharmaceutical products is highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they observe do not comply with regulations. We, our third-party manufacturers and our corporate partners are subject to current Good Manufacturing Practices ('GMP'), which are extensive regulations governing manufacturing processes, stability testing,  record  keeping  and  quality  standards  as  defined  by  FDA  and  the  EMA.  Similar  regulations  are  in  effect  in  other jurisdictions. Our manufacturing operations are subject to routine inspections by regulatory agencies.\n\nFor our cell therapy products, we are required by FDA to comply with the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program, which includes educating and certifying medical personnel regarding the therapy procedures and the potential side effect profile of our therapy, such as the potential adverse side effects related to cytokine release syndrome and neurologic toxicities. Additionally, we are required to maintain a complex chain of identity and custody with respect to patient material as such material moves to the manufacturing facilities, through the manufacturing process, and back to the patient.\n\n## Access to Raw Materials\n\nWe need access to certain raw materials to conduct our clinical trials and manufacture our products. These raw materials are generally available from multiple sources, purchased worldwide and normally available in quantities adequate to meet the needs of our business. We attempt to manage the risks associated with our supply chain by inventory management, relationship management and evaluation of alternative sources when feasible. For more information, see Item 1A Risk Factors 'We may not be able to obtain materials or supplies necessary to conduct clinical trials or to manufacture and sell our products, which could limit our ability to generate revenues.'\n\n## Human Capital\n\nGilead's success depends on the work of its dedicated employees who embrace a shared sense of purpose and a culture of excellence. Our human capital objective is to make Gilead the employer of choice for the best talent in our industry. Gilead's key priorities for human capital management include inclusion and diversity, health and safety, total rewards, employee development and  engagement.  The  Compensation  and  Talent  Committee  of  our  Board  of  Directors  oversees  our  overall  human  capital management.\n\n## Inclusion &amp; Diversity\n\nInclusion is a Gilead core value, and we believe building an inclusive and diverse workforce is critical to enabling Gilead's mission. Our Global Inclusion and Diversity Council is responsible for governance of these matters, tracking progress on our goals and promoting a culture of inclusion. The Global Inclusion and Diversity Council is chaired by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and includes members of our leadership team. In 2020, we introduced our Advancing Black Leadership Strategy, a multiyear initiative  that  outlines  our  commitments to create internal and external pipelines for diverse talent and to build awareness, capabilities and accountability among our people managers. As part of this strategy, we set clear targets for representation within our  overall  workforce  and  executive  populations,  including  goals  to  increase  the  percentage  of  female,  Black  and  Hispanic employees  with  well-defined  annual  targets  through  2025.  Gilead  also  implemented  multiple  programs  to  train  managers  on inclusion and diversity topics, and created strategies and initiatives focused on attracting, developing and retaining diverse talent and driving an inclusive culture in our workplace, which organizational leaders were required to regularly review starting in 2021. In addition, our employee resource groups ('ERGs') support diverse employees and aim to raise awareness of different cultures within the workplace, cultivate diversity as a business strength and support Gilead's talent acquisition strategy to source, attract and recruit  diverse  candidates.  Executive  sponsors  and  leaders  of  our  ERGs  contribute  to  the  advancement  of  our  inclusion  and diversity commitments through service on our Global Inclusion and Diversity Council.\n\nWe believe Gilead's inclusive and diverse workforce is the foundation for innovation and productivity. Gilead's commitment to  equal  employment  opportunity  furthers  its  efforts  to  cultivate  and  celebrate  an  equitable  culture  of  belonging.  As  of December 31, 2021, Gilead had approximately 14,400 employees, and Gilead's global workforce was approximately 52% female and 48% male. Additionally, women represented 34% of Gilead's leadership (defined as vice president level and above). In the United States, based on our employees' voluntary self-identification, our workforce was 40% White, 38% Asian, 11% Hispanic, 7% Black and 4% Other.",
