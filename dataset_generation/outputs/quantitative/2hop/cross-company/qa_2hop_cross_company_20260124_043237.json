      "answer": "Tesla's 2023 cost of revenues for Services and Other was $7,830 million, while General Motors' 2023 revenue for Services and Other was $5,157 million. The difference is $7,830 - $5,157 = $2,673 million. This indicates that Tesla incurs significantly higher costs in its Services and Other segment than GM generates in revenue from a similar category, suggesting Tesla may be investing more heavily or facing higher expenses in this area, while GM is generating positive revenue with lower associated costs.",

      "answer": "GM's 2023 data highlights its vehicle sales performance across geographic regions, indicating its competitive position in traditional automotive markets. In contrast, Tesla reported $1.53 billion in future operating lease commitments for vehicle and solar arrangements, showing a strategic emphasis on leasing models. This suggests Tesla relies more on long-term lease receivables to drive revenue, while GM focuses on direct vehicle sales, which affects liquidity and revenue recognition timing differently for each company.",

      "answer": "GM's regulatory risks related to vehicle emissions could lead to increased costs and reduced profitability, potentially affecting their ability to compete in the vehicle sales market. This could create an opportunity for companies like Tesla, which are already focused on electric vehicles and have leasing activities totaling $1.53 billion, to gain a larger market share as consumers shift towards more environmentally friendly options.",

      "answer": "GM Financial's leasing program is heavily exposed to residual values, as evidenced by its leasing penetration and the $0.9 billion gain on lease terminations in 2023, which is directly influenced by used vehicle prices and lease portfolio net book values. In contrast, Tesla does not include vehicle sales with resale value guarantees in its standard disclosures, indicating a different risk profile where upfront cash payments reduce future residual value exposure. This means GM bears more residual risk through its leasing model, while Tesla mitigates this risk by receiving payments upfront and not including such arrangements in future payment disclosures.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, GM Financial's leasing program is exposed to residual values, with $0.9 billion in gains on lease terminations in 2023, and leasing penetration is a key part of its financing strategy.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, Tesla explicitly states that vehicle sales with resale value guarantees are not included in its future payment disclosures because cash is received upfront, reducing exposure to residual value fluctuations.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The difference in financial structure (leasing with residual exposure for GM vs. upfront payments with resale guarantees for Tesla) leads to different levels of residual value risk exposure, impacting how each company manages financial volatility tied to used vehicle prices."

      "answer": "General Motors explicitly discloses transactions between its Automotive segments and GM Financial, indicating that these amounts are presented in GM Financial's consolidated balance sheets and statements of income. In contrast, Tesla does not mention any direct financial affiliate related to its Automotive segment but instead discusses its involvement with Variable Interest Entities (VIEs), particularly in relation to solar energy systems and vehicle leasing programs, where Tesla acts as the primary beneficiary. Therefore, GM's Automotive segment interacts with a traditional financial subsidiary whose transactions are fully consolidated and transparently reported, while Tesla's Automotive-related financial activities are structured through VIEs, which are consolidated based on primary beneficiary status rather than direct ownership.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - GM discloses transactions between its Automotive segments and GM Financial, which are included in GM Financial's consolidated financial statements.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Tesla does not mention a financial subsidiary like GM Financial but instead discusses VIEs related to leasing and solar systems, where Tesla consolidates based on being the primary beneficiary.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The difference lies in how each company structures and reports financial interactions tied to their Automotive segments: GM uses a traditional subsidiary (GM Financial), while Tesla uses VIEs for similar purposes but under different accounting treatment."

In contrast, General Motors reports changes in Automotive available liquidity, which includes financial metrics like letters of credit outstanding ($0.7 billion at December 31, 2023). This highlights how Tesla's financial structure emphasizes warranty liabilities tied to automotive sales, while GM focuses on liquidity metrics within the same segment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - General Motors reports $0.7 billion in letters of credit outstanding under the Automotive segment at December 31, 2023.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Tesla's warranty reserve is primarily related to its automotive segment, with warranty expenses recorded as a component of Cost of Revenues.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The prominence of the automotive segment leads Tesla to classify warranty expenses directly under Cost of Revenues, whereas GM emphasizes liquidity metrics like letters of credit to manage financial flexibility within the same segment."

      "answer": "General Motors had $0.7 billion in letters of credit outstanding under its sub-facility related to the Automotive segment at the end of 2023, indicating a specific liquidity commitment tied to automotive operations. Tesla, on the other hand, applies complex liquidity and financial structuring through variable interest entities (VIEs) in both its Automotive and energy segments, which allows it to off-balance-sheet financing for certain leasing and solar programs. This difference in liquidity management suggests that Tesla may have greater financial flexibility through its VIE arrangements, while GM\u2019s more transparent but rigid liquidity commitments could limit flexibility in the Automotive segment.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - GM had $0.7 billion in letters of credit outstanding under its sub-facility related to the Automotive segment at December 31, 2023.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Tesla uses variable interest entities (VIEs) to facilitate funding and monetization of attributes associated with vehicle leasing and solar systems, which are not consolidated unless Tesla is the primary beneficiary.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The difference in liquidity management (GM's direct commitments vs. Tesla's VIE-based off-balance-sheet financing) affects financial flexibility. Tesla\u2019s approach allows for more flexible liquidity, while GM\u2019s is more transparent but potentially restrictive."

This model eliminates third-party dealerships and allows Tesla to maintain control over the customer experience and pricing. General Motors, on the other hand, has transactions between its Automotive segments and GM Financial, indicating a more traditional integration of automotive sales with in-house financing and leasing services. This contrast shows that Tesla's vertically integrated, direct-sales approach differs significantly from GM's model, which relies on financial services to facilitate vehicle purchases. The shared presence of the Automotive Segment as a reportable and financially active unit enables both companies to structure their respective strategies around their organizational and financial ecosystems.",

This distinction is rooted in how each company structures its Automotive Segment's role in sales and financial transactions."

      "answer": "GM's Automotive net sales and revenue for 2023 totaled $157,667 million, indicating a strong focus on traditional automotive sales and revenue generation. In contrast, Tesla's strategy in the Automotive segment emphasizes innovation through engineering feats such as integrating batteries directly with vehicle body structures, which optimizes manufacturability, weight, range, and cost characteristics. This implies that while GM is leveraging its established automotive business for revenue, Tesla is prioritizing technological advancements to enhance product performance and reduce costs, potentially positioning itself for long-term competitive advantage in electric vehicles.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - GM's Automotive net sales and revenue for 2023 is $157,667 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Tesla integrates batteries directly with vehicle body structures to optimize manufacturability, weight, range, and cost characteristics.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - GM's revenue highlights its focus on traditional automotive sales, while Tesla's engineering approach reflects a strategy centered on innovation and cost optimization in vehicle design."

      "answer": "Tesla's modular design approach in energy storage products optimizes manufacturing capacity and integrates battery systems directly into vehicle body structures, reducing development time and improving cost efficiency. This modular expertise is shared across Tesla's automotive and energy divisions, enhancing its in-house automotive design and engineering capabilities. In contrast, General Motors relies on internal financial transactions between its Automotive segments and GM Financial, suggesting a more segmented and financially interdependent strategy. Tesla's unified modular and engineering strategy likely reduces complexity and supports faster innovation cycles compared to GM's internal financial coordination model.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - GM's Automotive segments conduct internal financial transactions with GM Financial, indicating interdependence between automotive operations and financial services.",

        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b - Tesla has in-house capabilities in automotive design and test engineering that reduce product development time and improve cost characteristics.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - Tesla's modular and integrated engineering approach across energy and automotive segments enhances efficiency and innovation speed, whereas GM's model depends on internal financial coordination between automotive and financial units, suggesting different strategic priorities in operational integration."

      "answer": "In General Motors' Automotive Segment, revenue generation is influenced by transactions with GM Financial, which include financing and leasing activities, as stated in their 2023 10-K filing. In contrast, Tesla's Automotive Segment generates revenue through the design, development, manufacturing, sales, and leasing of electric vehicles, along with automotive regulatory credits, services, and other activities such as used vehicle sales and Supercharging, as detailed in their 2023 10-K filing. These differences highlight distinct business models centered around the Automotive Segment.",

      "answer": "Tesla accrues a warranty reserve for its automotive segment, estimating future repair or replacement costs for vehicles sold, which is recorded as a component of Cost of Revenues. This reserve is based on historical claims and projected future costs, indicating a proactive cost management approach by anticipating long-term liabilities. In contrast, GM's Automotive segments engage in transactions with GM Financial, which are detailed in GM Financial's consolidated financial statements, suggesting a focus on intercompany financing and risk distribution rather than direct cost accrual for product warranties. This reveals that Tesla assumes direct liability for its product warranties, while GM leverages financial subsidiaries to manage transactional exposure.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - GM's Automotive segments have transactions with GM Financial, as detailed in GM Financial's consolidated balance sheets and income statements.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - The contrast lies in how each company manages financial exposure: Tesla internalizes warranty costs as a direct liability, while GM channels financial risk through GM Financial, indicating differing cost management strategies."

This difference in revenue recognition timing and structure makes direct comparison of automotive revenues between the two companies challenging, as GM's 2024 figure reflects only a portion of its total automotive-related income, with a larger share deferred into future periods through financing arrangements.",

      "answer": "Booking.com's back-to-travel incentive programs resulted in a $100 million reduction in revenue in 2020 due to additional rebates offered to customers under its Genius and Preferred Partner Programs, with a corresponding liability of $25 million at year-end. This indicates that marketing incentives directly reduced Booking.com's top-line revenue as the company provided discounts that were recognized as a reduction in revenue at the time of issuance. Meanwhile, General Motors' profitability is described as being dependent on offering marketing incentives to maintain vehicle pricing and market share in a competitive environment. GM acknowledges that offering such incentives may result in vehicle prices that do not offset costs, thereby affecting profitability. While GM does not provide a specific dollar amount for its marketing incentive costs, the exposure to reduced margins is evident when compared to Booking.com, which explicitly quantifies the financial impact of its incentive programs. Thus, both companies experience a causal relationship where marketing incentives reduce revenue or margin, but the degree of quantified exposure differs between the two.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Booking.com's back-to-travel campaigns led to a $100 million reduction in revenue in 2020, with a liability of $25 million at December 31, 2020.",

          "chunk_text": "## Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance\n\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued a new accounting update to increase the transparency of government assistance including the disclosure of (1) the types of assistance, (2) an entity's accounting for the assistance, and (3) the effect of the assistance on an entity's financial statements. This update is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021. The Company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 21 for additional information on government assistance.\n\n## 3 . REVENUE\n\n## Disaggregation of Revenue\n\n## Revenue by Type of Service\n\nApproximately 87%, 88%, and 87% of the Company's revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, relates to online accommodation reservation services. Revenue from all other sources of online travel reservation services and advertising and other revenues each individually represent less than 10% of the Company's total revenues for each year.\n\n## Revenue by Geographic Area\n\nSee Note 18 for the information related to revenue by geographic area.\n\n## Deferred Merchant Bookings and Deferred Revenue\n\nCash payments received from travelers in advance of the Company completing its performance obligations are included in \"Deferred merchant bookings\" in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and are comprised principally of amounts estimated to be payable to the travel service providers as well as the Company's estimated deferred revenue for its commission or margin and fees. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, deferred merchant bookings included deferred revenue for online travel reservation services of $148 million and $50 million, respectively. The amounts are subject to refunds for cancellations. The Company expects to complete its performance obligations generally within one year from the reservation date. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized revenues of $35 million from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2020. The increase in the deferred revenue balance for the year ended December 31, 2021 is principally driven by payments received from travelers, net of amounts estimated to be payable to travel service providers, for online travel reservations in the current period.\n\n## Loyalty and Other Incentive Programs\n\nThe Company provides loyalty programs, such as OpenTable's loyalty program, where participating consumers are awarded loyalty points on current transactions that can be redeemed in the future. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, liabilities for loyalty program incentives of $13 million and $21 million, respectively, were included in \"Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The estimated fair value of the loyalty points that are expected to be redeemed is recognized as a reduction of revenue at the time the incentives are granted. In 2020, the Company recorded a decrease of $28 million to the liability, primarily due to changes in estimates of the number of loyalty points expected to be redeemed prior to expiration under OpenTable's loyalty program, with a corresponding increase to revenue.\n\nIn addition to the loyalty programs, at December 31, 2021 and 2020, liabilities of $58 million and $60 million, respectively, for other incentive programs, such as referral bonuses, rebates, credits, and discounts, including for Booking.com's back-to-travel campaigns, were included in \"Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During 2020, the Company offered additional rebates to customers meeting certain eligibility requirements under an incentive program at Booking.com. The eligibility requirements include the customer's enrollment in Booking.com's Genius Program (program features include special discounts offered by customers to frequent travelers) and Preferred Partner Program (program features include greater visibility for customers in search results for payment of higher commission) and timely payment of invoices. The additional rebates resulted in a reduction of revenue of $100 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 and a liability of $25 million at December 31, 2020.",

If we are unable to successfully deliver on our EV strategy, it  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  our  results  of  operations,  financial  condition  and  growth  prospects,  and  could  negatively impact our brand and reputation.\n\nOur near-term profitability is dependent upon the success of our current line of full-size ICE SUVs and full-size ICE pickup trucks. While we offer a broad portfolio of cars, crossovers, SUVs and trucks, and we have announced significant plans to design, build and sell a broad portfolio of EVs, we currently recognize higher profit margins on our full-size ICE SUVs and full-size ICE trucks. Our near-term success is dependent upon our ability to sell higher margin vehicles in sufficient volumes. We also plan to use the cash generated by our ICE vehicles to fund our growth strategy, including the development and sale of EVs and AVs. Any nearterm shift in consumer preferences toward smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, whether as a result of increases in the price of oil or any  sustained  shortage  of  oil,  including  as  a  result  of  global  political  instability,  concerns  about  climate  change,  including  any constraints related to lending on GHG-emitting products, or other reasons, could weaken the demand for our higher margin vehicles. More  stringent  fuel  economy  regulations  could  also  impact  our  ability  to  sell  these  vehicles  or  could  result  in  additional  costs associated with these vehicles. See 'Our operations and products are subject to extensive laws, regulations and policies, including those related to vehicle emissions and fuel economy standards, which can significantly increase our costs and affect how we do business.'\n\nWe operate  in  a  highly  competitive  industry  that  has  historically  had  excess  manufacturing  capacity,  and  attempts  by  our competitors to sell  more vehicles could have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing, market share and operating results. The global automotive industry is highly competitive in terms of the quality, innovation, new technologies, pricing, fuel economy,  reliability,  safety,  customer  service  and  financial  services  offered. Additionally,  overall  manufacturing  capacity  in  the industry has historically far exceeded demand. In addition, we have made, and plan to continue to make, significant investments in EV  manufacturing  capacity  based  on  our  expectations  for  EV  demand,  which  is  subject  to  various  risks  and  uncertainties  as described above. Many manufacturers, including GM, have relatively high fixed labor costs as well as limitations on their ability to close facilities and reduce fixed costs, often as a result of collective bargaining agreements. In light of any excess capacity and high fixed costs, many industry participants have attempted to sell more vehicles by providing subsidized financing or leasing programs, offering marketing incentives or reducing vehicle prices. As a result, we may be required to offer similar incentives that may result in vehicle prices that do not offset our costs, including any cost increases or the impact of adverse currency fluctuations, which could affect our profitability. Our competitors may also seek to benefit from economies of scale by consolidating or entering into other strategic agreements such as alliances or joint ventures intended to enhance their competitiveness.\n\nManufacturers in countries that have lower production costs, such as China and India, have become competitors in key emerging markets and have announced their intention to export their products to established markets as a low-cost alternative to established entry-level automobiles. In addition, foreign governments may decide to implement tax and other policies that favor their domestic manufacturers at the expense of international manufacturers, including GM and its joint venture partners. These actions have had, and are expected to continue to have, a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing, market share and operating results in these markets.\n\nOur AV strategy is dependent upon our ability to successfully mitigate unique technological, operational and regulatory risks. GM  Cruise  Holdings LLC  (Cruise Holdings), our majority-owned subsidiary, is responsible for the development  and commercialization of AV technology. Our AV operations are capital intensive and subject to a variety of  risks  inherent  with  the development of new technologies, including our ability to continue to develop self-driving software and hardware, such as Light Detection  and  Ranging  (LiDAR)  sensors  and  other  components;  access  to  sufficient  capital;  risks  related  to  the  manufacture  of purpose-built AVs; and significant competition from both established automotive companies and technology companies, some of which  may  have  more  resources  and  capital  to  devote  to A V  technologies  than  we  do.  In  addition,  we  face  risks  related  to  the commercial deployment of AVs on our targeted timeline or at all, including consumer acceptance, achievement of adequate safety and other performance standards and compliance with uncertain, evolving and potentially conflicting federal and state or provincial regulations. To the extent accidents, cybersecurity breaches or other adverse events associated with our autonomous driving systems occur, we could be subject to liability, reputational harm, government scrutiny and further regulation, and it could deter consumer adoption of AV technology. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects.",

See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the acquisition of Getaroom in December 2021.\n\nWe review long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based upon the ability to recover the carrying value of the assets from the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, before interest and taxes, of the related asset group. As of December 31, 2021, no impairment indicators were identified for our long-lived assets.\n\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. We test goodwill at a reporting unit level and our annual goodwill impairment tests are performed as of September 30. As of September 30, 2021, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill. No additional impairment indicators were identified as of December 31, 2021.\n\n## 2020 Interim Goodwill Impairment Test\n\nDue to the significant and negative financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements), we performed an interim period goodwill impairment test at March 31, 2020 and recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $489 million related to the OpenTable and KAYAK reporting unit for the three months ended March 31, 2020, which is not tax-deductible, resulting in an adjusted carrying value of goodwill for OpenTable and KAYAK of $1.5 billion at March 31, 2020. The goodwill impairment was primarily driven by a significant reduction in the forecasted near-term cash flows of OpenTable and KAYAK as well as the significant decline in comparable companies' market values as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe estimated fair value of OpenTable and KAYAK was determined using a combination of standard valuation techniques, including an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach (applying the recent decline in enterprise values of comparable publicly-traded companies to the recently calculated fair value for OpenTable and KAYAK as well as applying comparable company multiples).\n\nThe income approach estimates fair value utilizing long-term growth rates and discount rates applied to the cash flow projections. In the cash flow projections, we assumed at the time that OpenTable and KAYAK would experience a significant decline in near-term cash flows with a recovery to 2019 levels of financial performance (including profitability) occurring in 2023. The shape and timing of the recovery was a key assumption in our fair value calculation (both in the income and market approaches).\n\n## 2020 Annual Goodwill Impairment Test\n\nAs of September 30, 2020, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $573 million for the OpenTable and KAYAK reporting unit for the three months ended September 30, 2020, which is not tax-deductible, resulting in an adjusted carrying value of goodwill for OpenTable and KAYAK of $1.0 billion at September 30, 2020. The goodwill impairment was primarily driven by a significant reduction in the forecasted cash flows of OpenTable and KAYAK, reflecting a longer assumed recovery period to 2019 levels of profitability, mainly due to the continued material adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on the flight vertical at KAYAK, and the lowered outlook for monetization opportunities in restaurant reservation services.\n\nThe estimated fair value of OpenTable and KAYAK was determined using a combination of standard valuation techniques, including an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach (applying comparable company multiples).\n\nThe income approach estimates fair value utilizing long-term growth rates and discount rates applied to the cash flow projections. The income approach, applied as of September 30, 2020, reflected a reduction in the forecasted cash flows of OpenTable and KAYAK and a longer assumed recovery period to 2019 levels of profitability, driven primarily by a lowered outlook for monetization opportunities in restaurant reservation services and slower than previously expected recovery trends for airline travel, which is a key vertical for KAYAK. For the interim goodwill impairment test at March 31, 2020, we expected a recovery to 2019 levels of financial performance occurring in 2023 for OpenTable and KAYAK. Based on our evaluation of all relevant information available as of September 30, 2020 for the annual goodwill impairment test, we expected at the time that OpenTable and KAYAK would not return to the 2019 level of profitability within five years from that date, and that it was uncertain whether the shape of the recovery would ultimately match our expectations.

In 2022, GM Financial expects used vehicle prices may decrease relative to 2021 levels, but to remain above pre-pandemic levels, primarily due to sustained low new vehicle inventory.\n\nPension and OPEB Plans Our defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection of various assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, a discount rate, mortality rates of participants and expectation of mortality improvement. Our pension obligations include Korean statutory pension payments that are valued on a walk away basis. The expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes, risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. While the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns, the assumptions are primarily long-term, prospective rates of return.",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on February 24, 2021.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nFrench tax authorities conducted audits of Booking.com for the years 2003 through 2012, 2013 through 2015, and 2016 through 2018. In December 2015, the French tax authorities issued Booking.com assessments for unpaid income and value added taxes (\"VAT\") related to tax years 2006 through 2012 for approximately 356 million Euros ($403 million), the majority of which represents penalties and interest. The assessments assert that Booking.com had a permanent establishment in France. In December 2019, the French tax authorities issued an additional assessment of 70 million Euros ($80 million), including interest and penalties, for the 2013 year asserting that Booking.com had taxable income attributable to a permanent establishment in France. The French tax authorities also have issued assessments totaling 39 million Euros ($45 million), including interest and penalties, for certain tax years between 2011 and 2015 on Booking.com's French subsidiary asserting that the subsidiary did not receive sufficient compensation for the services it rendered to Booking.com in the Netherlands. In December 2021, the French tax authorities issued assessments on Booking.com's French subsidiary totaling 78 million Euros ($88 million), including interest and penalties, for the tax years 2016 through 2018 again asserting that the subsidiary did not receive sufficient compensation for the services it rendered to Booking.com. As a result of a formal demand from the French tax authorities for payment of the amounts assessed against Booking.com for the years 2006 through 2012, in January 2019, we paid the assessments of approximately 356 million Euros ($403 million) in order to preserve our right to contest those assessments in court. The payment, which is included in \"Other assets, net\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2021 and 2020, does not constitute an admission that we owe the taxes and will be refunded (with interest) to us to the extent we prevail. In December 2019 and October 2020, we initiated court proceedings with respect to certain of the assessments. Although we believe that Booking.com has been, and continues to be, in compliance with French tax law, and we are contesting the assessments, during the three months ended September 30, 2020, we contacted the French tax authorities regarding the potential to achieve resolution of the matter through a settlement. After assessing several potential outcomes and potential settlement amounts and terms, an unrecognized tax benefit in the amount of 50 million Euros ($59 million) was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020, of which the majority was included as a partial reduction to the tax payment recorded in \"Other assets, net\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2021 and 2020. In December 2020, the French Administrative Court (Conseil d'Etat) delivered a decision in the \"ValueClick\" case that could have an impact on the outcome in our case. After considering the potential adverse impact of the new decision on the potential outcomes for the Booking.com assessments, we currently estimate that the reasonably possible loss related to VAT is approximately 20 million Euros ($22 million). For additional information related to the French and other tax assessments, see Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - \" We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities. \"\n\nBeginning in 2014, Booking.com received several letters from the Netherlands Pension Fund for the Travel Industry (Reiswerk) (\"BPF\") claiming that Booking.com is required to participate in the mandatory pension scheme of the BPF with retroactive effect to 1999, which has a higher contribution rate than the pension scheme in which Booking.com is currently participating. BPF instituted legal proceedings against Booking.com and in 2016 the District Court of Amsterdam rejected all of BPF's claims. BPF appealed the decision to the Court of Appeal, and, in May 2019, the Court of Appeal also rejected all of BPF's claims, in each case by ruling that Booking.com does not meet the definition of a travel intermediary for purposes of the mandatory pension scheme. BPF then appealed to the Netherlands Supreme Court. In April 2021, the Supreme Court overturned the previous decision of the Court of Appeal and held that Booking.com meets the definition of a travel intermediary for the purposes of the mandatory pension scheme. The Supreme Court ruled only on the qualification of Booking.com as a travel intermediary for the purposes of the mandatory pension scheme, and did not rule on the various other defenses we brought forward against BPF's claims. The Supreme Court referred the matter to another Court of Appeal that will have to assess the other defenses we brought forward if BPF were to proceed with the litigation. We intend to pursue a number of defenses in any subsequent proceedings and may ultimately prevail in whole or in part. While we continue to believe that Booking.com is in compliance with its pension obligations and that the Court of Appeal could ultimately rule in favor of Booking.com, given the Supreme Court's decision, we believe it is probable that we have incurred a loss related to this matter. We are not able to reasonably estimate a loss or a range of loss because there are significant factual and legal questions yet to be determined in any subsequent proceedings. As a result, as of December 31, 2021, we have not recorded a liability in connection with a potential adverse ultimate outcome to this litigation. However, if Booking.com were to ultimately lose and all of BPF's claims were to be accepted (including with retroactive effect to 1999), we estimate that as of December 31, 2021, the maximum loss, not including any potential interest or penalties, would be approximately 289 million Euros ($328 million). Such estimated potential loss increases as Booking.com continues not to contribute to the BPF and depends on Booking.com's applicable",

      "answer": "Booking.com estimated a reasonably possible loss of \u20ac20 million ($22 million) related to VAT assessments in France, based on potential adverse impacts from a court decision, and did not accrue any liability for Italian VAT audit recommendations of \u20ac154 million ($175 million) or Turkish tax assessments totaling 813 million Turkish Lira ($61 million), as it believes it is in compliance with applicable laws. In contrast, GM accrued $2.8 billion in warranty recall campaign liabilities, including $2.0 billion for the Chevrolet Bolt recall, and estimated its reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued to be insignificant, indicating a higher degree of certainty in its obligations. This reveals that Booking.com's contingent liabilities are largely uncertain and under dispute, while GM's liabilities were more quantifiable and largely covered by supplier reimbursements, resulting in minimal additional exposure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, Booking.com estimates a reasonably possible VAT-related loss of \u20ac20 million ($22 million) in France and faces additional contingent liabilities in Italy and Turkey without accruals, indicating high uncertainty and ongoing legal disputes.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, GM accrued $2.8 billion for automotive recall liabilities, including $2.0 billion for the Chevrolet Bolt recall, with supplier reimbursement from LG substantially offsetting the exposure, and estimates its reasonably possible additional loss as insignificant.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The difference in reasonably possible loss estimation reflects contrasting natures of contingent obligations: Booking.com faces uncertain, dispute-driven tax liabilities, while GM's are more defined, with mitigating supplier agreements reducing residual risk."

After considering the potential adverse impact of the new decision on the potential outcomes for the Booking.com assessments, the Company currently estimates that the reasonably possible loss related to VAT is approximately 20 million Euros ($22 million).\n\nIn December 2018 and December 2019, the Italian tax authorities issued assessments on Booking.com's Italian subsidiary for approximately 48 million Euros ($54 million) for the 2013 tax year and 58 million Euros ($66 million) for the 2014 tax year asserting that its transfer pricing policies were inadequate. The Company believes Booking.com has been, and continues to be, in compliance with Italian tax law. In September 2020, the Italian tax authorities approved the opening of a Mutual Agreement Procedure (\"MAP\") between Italy and the Netherlands for the 2013 tax year and Booking.com has submitted a request that the 2014 tax year be added to the MAP. Based on the possibility of the 2013 and 2014 Italian assessments being settled through the MAP process, and, after considering potential resolution amounts, a net unrecognized tax benefit amount of 4 million Euros ($5 million) was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020. In March 2021, the Italian authorities issued assessments on Booking.com's Italian subsidiary for approximately 31 million Euros ($36 million) for the 2015 tax year, again asserting that its transfer pricing policies were inadequate. Based on the Company's expectation that the Italian assessments for 2013, 2014, 2015 and any transfer pricing assessments received for subsequent open years will be settled through the MAP process, and after considering potential resolution amounts, an additional net unrecognized tax benefit of 13 million Euros ($16 million) was recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2021. In August 2021, the Italian tax authorities issued a transfer pricing assessment on Booking.com's Italian subsidiary for approximately 114 million Euros ($130 million) for the periods 2016-2018. The Company intends to submit a request that the 2016-2018 assessment be added to the MAP. Because the unrecognized tax benefit recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2021 already reflected consideration of potential resolution amounts for Italian transfer pricing assessments for all open tax years, including 2016-2018, no additional unrecognized tax benefit has been recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021. In December 2019, the Company paid $10 million Euros ($11 million) as a partial prepayment of the 2013 assessment to avoid any collection enforcement from the Italian tax authorities pending the appeal phase of the case. The payment, which is included in \"Other assets, net\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, does not constitute an admission that the Company owes the taxes and will be refunded (with interest) to the Company to the extent that the Company prevails. A total of 5 million Euros ($6 million) of the net unrecognized tax benefits recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 has been included as a partial reduction to the tax payment recorded in \"Other assets, net\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Similarly, the Company expects to be required to make prepayment deposits or provide bank guarantees of approximately 59 million Euros ($68 million), which is equal to one-third of the interest and taxes for the 2014, 2015, and 2016-2018 assessments to avoid any collection enforcement from the Italian tax authorities pending the MAP proceedings.\n\nIn June 2021, the investigative arm of the Italian tax authorities issued a Tax Audit Report for the 2013 through 2019 Italian V AT audit. While the Tax Audit Report does not constitute a formal tax assessment, it recommends that an assessment of 154 million Euros ($175 million), plus interest and penalties, should be made on Booking.com BV for VAT related to commissions charged to certain Italian accommodation providers. The Company believes that Booking.com has been, and continues to be, in compliance with Italian and EU VAT laws and the Company has not recorded any liability in connection with the Tax Audit Report. It is unclear what further actions, if any, the Italian authorities will take with respect to the V AT audit for the periods 2013 through 2019. Such actions could include closing the investigation, assessing Booking.com additional taxes and/or imposing interest, fines, penalties or criminal proceedings.\n\nIn 2018 and 2019, Turkish tax authorities asserted that Booking.com has a permanent establishment in Turkey and have issued tax assessments for the years 2012 through 2018 for approximately 813 million Turkish Lira ($61 million), which includes interest and penalties through December 31, 2021. The Company believes that Booking.com has been, and continues to be, in compliance with Turkish tax law, and the Company is contesting these assessments in court. The Company has not recorded a liability in connection with these assessments. In December 2021, the Company paid approximately 118 million Turkish Lira ($9 million) of the assessments in order to preserve its right to contest a portion of the assessments in court. The payment, which is included in \"Other assets, net\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2021 does not constitute an admission that the Company owes the taxes and will be refunded to the Company to the extent the Company prevails.",

The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries  whose  local  currency  is  not  their  functional  currency  are  remeasured  from  their  local  currency  to  their  functional currency and then translated to U.S. Dollars. Revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. Dollars using the average exchange rates prevailing for each period presented. The financial statements of any foreign subsidiary that has been identified as having a highly inflationary economy are remeasured as if the functional currency were the U.S. Dollar.\n\nGains  and  losses  arising  from  foreign  currency  transactions  and  the  effects  of  remeasurements  discussed  in  the  preceding paragraph are recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales and GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses unless related to Automotive debt, which are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. Foreign currency transaction and remeasurement gains were $17 million, losses of $203 million and gains of $85 million in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value. The accounting  for  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  each  derivative  financial  instrument  depends  on  whether  it  has  been  designated  and qualifies  as  an  accounting  hedge,  as  well  as  the  type  of  hedging  relationship  identified.  Derivative  instruments  are  not  used  for trading or speculative purposes.\n\nAutomotive We utilize options, swaps and forward contracts to manage foreign currency and commodity price risk. The change in fair value of option and forward contracts not designated as hedges is recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. Cash flows for all derivative financial instruments are classified in cash flows from operating activities.\n\nWe estimate the fair value of the Stellantis warrants using a Black-Scholes formula. The significant inputs to the model include the Stellantis stock price and the estimated dividend yield.

The risk being hedged is the risk of changes in the fair value of the hedged debt attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate or the risk of changes in fair value attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If the swap has been designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses. The change in fair value of the related hedge is also recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses.\n\nCertain interest rate swap and foreign currency swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges.

The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries  whose  local  currency  is  not  their  functional  currency  are  remeasured  from  their  local  currency  to  their  functional currency and then translated to U.S. Dollars. Revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. Dollars using the average exchange rates prevailing for each period presented. The financial statements of any foreign subsidiary that has been identified as having a highly inflationary economy are remeasured as if the functional currency were the U.S. Dollar.\n\nGains  and  losses  arising  from  foreign  currency  transactions  and  the  effects  of  remeasurements  discussed  in  the  preceding paragraph are recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales and GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses unless related to Automotive debt, which are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. Foreign currency transaction and remeasurement gains were $17 million, losses of $203 million and gains of $85 million in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value. The accounting  for  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  each  derivative  financial  instrument  depends  on  whether  it  has  been  designated  and qualifies  as  an  accounting  hedge,  as  well  as  the  type  of  hedging  relationship  identified.  Derivative  instruments  are  not  used  for trading or speculative purposes.\n\nAutomotive We utilize options, swaps and forward contracts to manage foreign currency and commodity price risk. The change in fair value of option and forward contracts not designated as hedges is recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. Cash flows for all derivative financial instruments are classified in cash flows from operating activities.\n\nWe estimate the fair value of the Stellantis warrants using a Black-Scholes formula. The significant inputs to the model include the Stellantis stock price and the estimated dividend yield. We are entitled to receive any dividends declared by Stellantis through the conversion date upon exercise of the warrants. Gains or losses as a result of the change in the fair value of the Stellantis warrants are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net.\n\nAutomotive Financing - GM Financial GM Financial utilizes interest rate derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk and foreign currency derivative instruments to manage foreign currency risk. The change in fair value of the derivative instruments not designated as hedges is recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses. Cash flows for all derivative financial instruments are classified in cash flows from operating activities.\n\nCertain interest rate and foreign currency swap agreements have been designated as fair value hedges. The risk being hedged is the risk of changes in the fair value of the hedged debt attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate or the risk of changes in fair value attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If the swap has been designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses. The change in fair value of the related hedge is also recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses.\n\nCertain interest rate swap and foreign currency swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges. The risk being hedged is  the  interest  rate  and foreign currency risk related to forecasted transactions. If the contract has been designated as a cash flow hedge, the change in the fair value of the cash flow hedge is deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and is recognized in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses along with the earnings effect of the hedged item when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded currently in earnings and are presented in the same income statement line as the earnings effect of the hedged item.",

      "answer": "BKNG utilizes incentives as part of its variable marketing spend, adjusting based on growth and profitability objectives, travel demand, and expected ROIs. In 2021, BKNG saw increased marketing expenses due to improved travel demand trends post-pandemic, but marketing expenses as a percentage of gross bookings decreased due to higher ROIs and favorable traffic channel shifts. GM, on the other hand, references incentives in the context of competitive pressures in the automotive industry, where the use of incentives is a long-standing practice to attract consumers amid a highly competitive landscape and shifting consumer preferences toward electric vehicles. For GM, incentives are part of a broader set of strategic responses to maintain market share and manage product transitions, especially in the face of new competitors and evolving technologies like electric and autonomous vehicles.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - BKNG's marketing expenses include incentives and are adjusted based on growth, profitability, and travel demand. In 2021, marketing spend rose due to improved travel trends, but became more efficient (lower % of gross bookings due to higher ROIs).",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - GM mentions incentives in the context of competitive pressures and changing consumer preferences, particularly around electric vehicles and new product introductions.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies use incentives, but in different strategic contexts: BKNG uses them as a lever within a variable cost model optimized for ROI and traffic efficiency, while GM uses them as part of a broader competitive response in a capital-intensive, product-cycle-driven industry."

Forward-looking statements are any statements other than statements of historical fact. Forward-looking  statements  represent  our  current  judgment  about  possible  future  events  and  are  often  identified  by  words  like 'aim,'  'anticipate,'  'appears,'  'approximately,'  'believe,'  'continue,'  'could,'  'designed,'  'effect,'  'estimate,'  'evaluate,' 'expect,'  'forecast,'  'goal,'  'initiative,'  'intend,'  'may,'  'objective,'  'outlook,'  'plan,'  'potential,'  'priorities,'  'project,' 'pursue,'  'seek,'  'should,'  'target,'  'when,'  'will,'  'would,'  or  the  negative  of  any  of  those  words  or  similar  expressions.  In making these statements, we rely on assumptions and analysis based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors we consider appropriate under the circumstances. We believe these  judgments  are  reasonable,  but  these  statements  are  not  guarantees  of  any  future  events  or  financial  results,  and  our  actual results may differ materially due to a variety of important factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors, which may be  revised  or  supplemented  in  subsequent  reports  we  file  with  the  SEC,  include,  among  others,  the  following:  (1)  our  ability  to deliver new products, services, technologies and customer experiences in response to increased competition and changing consumer preferences in the automotive industry; (2) our ability to timely fund and introduce new and improved vehicle models, including electric vehicles, that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers; (3) our ability to profitably deliver a broad portfolio of electric vehicles that will help drive consumer adoption; (4) the success of our current line of full-size SUVs and full-size pickup trucks; (5) our highly competitive industry, which has been historically characterized by excess manufacturing capacity and the use of  incentives,  and  the  introduction  of  new  and  improved  vehicle  models  by  our  competitors;  (6)  the  unique  technological, operational,  regulatory  and  competitive  risks  related  to  the  timing  and  commercialization  of  autonomous  vehicles;  (7)  risks associated with climate change, including increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, our transition to electric vehicles and the  potential  increased  impacts  of  severe  weather  events;  (8)  global  automobile  market  sales  volume,  which  can  be  volatile;  (9) prices  and  uncertain  availability  of  raw  materials  and  commodities  used  by  us  and  our  suppliers,  and  instability  in  logistics  and related costs; (10) our business in China, which is subject to unique operational, competitive, regulatory and economic risks; (11) the success of our ongoing strategic business relationships and of our joint ventures, which we cannot operate solely for our benefit and over which we may have limited control; (12) the international scale and footprint of our operations, which exposes us to a variety of unique  political,  economic,  competitive  and  regulatory  risks,  including  the  risk  of  changes  in  government  leadership  and  laws (including  labor,  trade,  tax  and  other  laws),  political  uncertainty  or  instability  and  economic  tensions  between  governments  and changes in international trade policies, new barriers to entry and changes to or withdrawals from free trade agreements, changes in foreign  exchange  rates  and  interest  rates,  economic  downturns  in  the  countries  in  which  we  operate,  differing  local  product preferences and product requirements, changes to and compliance with U.S. and foreign countries' export controls and economic sanctions,  differing  labor  regulations,  requirements  and  union  relationships,  differing  dealer  and  franchise  regulations  and relationships,  difficulties  in  obtaining  financing  in  foreign  countries,  and  public  health  crises,  including  the  occurrence  of  a contagious disease or illness, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; (13) any significant disruption, including any work stoppages, at any of our manufacturing facilities; (14) the ability of our suppliers to deliver parts, systems and components without disruption and at such times to allow us to meet production schedules; (15) the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; (16) the success of any restructurings or  other  cost  reduction  actions;  (17)  the  possibility  that  competitors  may  independently  develop  products  and  services  similar  to ours, or that our intellectual property rights are not sufficient to prevent competitors from developing or selling those products or services; (18) our ability to manage risks related to security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology systems and networked products, including connected vehicles and in-vehicle systems; (19) our ability to comply with increasingly complex, restrictive and punitive regulations relating to our enterprise data practices, including the collection, use, sharing and security of the Personal  Identifiable  Information  of  our  customers,  employees,  or  suppliers;  (20)  our  ability  to  comply  with  extensive  laws, regulations  and  policies  applicable  to  our  operations  and  products,  including  those  relating  to  fuel  economy,  emissions  and autonomous vehicles; (21) costs and risks associated with litigation and government investigations; (22) the costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services; (23) any additional tax expense or exposure; (24) our continued ability to develop captive financing capability through GM Financial; and (25) any significant increase in our pension funding requirements.

      "question": "How do fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect BKNG's stock price, and how might GM's capital allocation strategy involving dispositions influence its ability to manage financial volatility from similar external factors?",
      "answer": "BKNG's stock price is highly sensitive to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which impact its financial performance by affecting consumer travel behavior and altering the value of its foreign-currency-denominated revenues and net income when expressed in U.S. Dollars. This volatility makes forecasting and managing business performance more difficult. Meanwhile, GM has a capital allocation strategy that includes evaluating dispositions and other strategic actions to strengthen its competitive position while maintaining a strong balance sheet. For example, GM had a $5.0 billion stock repurchase program, of which $1.7 billion had been completed by the end of 2021. This strategy could help GM mitigate financial volatility from external factors like currency or economic conditions by allowing flexibility in managing liquidity and long-term obligations. Therefore, while BKNG experiences external pressure on its stock price due to FX volatility, GM\u2019s proactive capital structure adjustments through dispositions and repurchases could provide a buffer against similar market uncertainties.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - BKNG's stock price is highly volatile and influenced by foreign currency exchange rates, especially between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro, which affects consumer behavior and financial results.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - GM has a capital allocation strategy that includes dispositions and a stock repurchase program (authorized $5.0 billion, $1.7 billion completed by 2021), which supports managing liquidity and financial stability.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While BKNG's stock is directly affected by FX volatility, GM\u2019s strategic financial actions involving dispositions and repurchases could serve as a mechanism to manage exposure to similar external financial pressures."

Our material future uses of cash, which may vary from time to time based on market conditions and other factors, are focused on the three objectives of our capital allocation program: (1) grow our business at an average target ROIC-adjusted rate of 20% or greater; (2) maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet, including a target average automotive cash balance of $18 billion; and (3) after the first two objectives are met, return available cash to  shareholders.

The  remaining  portion  includes  labor  costs,  depreciation  and  amortization,  engineering,  freight  and  product warranty and recall campaigns.\n\nFactors that most significantly influence a region's profitability are industry volume, market share, and the relative mix of vehicles (trucks, crossovers, cars) sold. Variable profit is a key indicator of product profitability. Variable profit is defined as revenue less material cost, freight, the variable component of manufacturing expense and warranty and recall-related costs. Vehicles with higher selling  prices  generally  have  higher  variable  profit.  Refer  to  the  regional  sections  of  this  MD&amp;A  for  additional  information  on volume and mix.\n\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, unfavorable Cost was primarily due to: (1) increased material and freight costs of $4.0 billion; (2) increased engineering costs of $2.0 billion primarily related to accelerating our electric vehicle portfolio and the nonrecurrence of austerity measures implemented in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic; (3) increased manufacturing costs of $1.4 billion primarily related to the suspension of production and the non-recurrence of austerity measures implemented in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic; (4) increased costs of $1.1 billion primarily related to parts and accessories; (5) increased other employee related costs of $0.7 billion; (6) charges of $0.3 billion related to potential royalties accrued with respect to past sales; partially offset by (7) charges of $0.7 billion primarily related to dealer restructuring charges, property and intangible asset impairments, inventory provisions and employee separation charges in Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and India in 2020; and (8) a decrease in campaign and other warranty-related costs of $0.2 billion, which includes Chevrolet Bolt recall costs of $2.0 billion and associated recoveries of $1.9 billion. In the year ended December 31, 2021, unfavorable Other was due to the foreign currency effect resulting from the strengthening of the Canadian Dollar and other currencies against the U.S. Dollar, partially offset by the weakening of the Brazilian Real and other currencies against the U.S. Dollar.\n\n## Automotive and Other Selling, General and Administrative Expense\n\n",

      "answer": "BKNG experienced a decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses in 2021 due to reduced depreciation of computer equipment, which likely improved its cost structure and contributed positively to profitability. In contrast, GM's Automotive cost of sales includes depreciation and amortization as a significant component, and rising costs in areas like materials and engineering placed upward pressure on total expenses, negatively affecting profitability. Thus, while BKNG benefited from lower depreciation, GM faced cost headwinds that offset potential gains from other areas like variable profit.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - BKNG's depreciation and amortization expenses decreased in 2021 due to reduced computer equipment depreciation.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - GM's Automotive cost of sales includes depreciation and amortization as a key cost component, and 2021 saw increased material and engineering costs totaling $4.0 billion and $2.0 billion respectively.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - BKNG's reduced depreciation costs improved its cost profile, while GM's increased overall costs, including depreciation-related expenses, placed downward pressure on profitability."

We will continue to evaluate the use of derivative instruments in the future. See Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our derivative contracts.\n\nWe are exposed to equity price risk as it relates to changes in fair values of our investments in equity securities of publicly-traded companies and private companies. We recorded net losses of $569 million and net gains of $1.8 billion and $745 million related to these equity securities for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively (see Notes 5 and 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). The estimated fair values of our investments in equity securities of publicly-traded companies and private companies, excluding investments classified as debt securities for accounting purposes, were $2.9 billion and $325 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021, and $3.1 billion and $455 million, respectively, at December 31, 2020. Our investments in private companies, excluding investments classified as debt securities for accounting purposes, are measured at cost less impairment, if any. Such investments are also required to be measured at fair value as of the date of certain observable transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the fair values at December 31, 2021 and 2020 of our investments in equity securities of publicly-traded companies and private companies would have resulted in a loss, before tax, of approximately $320 million and $355 million, respectively, being recognized in net income.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we include a report of our management's assessment of the design and effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

These are obtained primarily for regulatory purposes and payment guarantees to third-party payment processors.\n\nMarketing expenses and personnel expenses are the most significant operating expenses for our business. We rely on marketing channels to generate a significant amount of traffic to our websites. We have established widely used and recognized ecommerce brands through marketing and promotional campaigns. See our Consolidated Statements of Operations and \"Trends\" and \"Results of Operations\" within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information on marketing expenses and personnel expenses including stock-based compensation expenses.\n\nWe believe that our existing cash balances and liquid resources will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital expenditures, and other obligations through at least the next twelve months. However, if we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to reduce our planned capital expenditures and scale back the scope of our business plans, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, our ability to compete or our future growth prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. If additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of our then current stockholders would be diluted. We may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, revenue growth or sustained profitability may not be realized, and future borrowings or equity sales may not be available in amounts sufficient to make anticipated capital expenditures, finance our strategies, or repay our indebtedness.\n\n## Cash Flow Analysis\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $2.8 billion, resulting from net income of $1.2 billion and a favorable impact from adjustments for non-cash items of $1.4 billion, and a favorable net change in working capital and other long-term assets and liabilities of $269 million. Non-cash items were principally associated with net losses on equity securities, deferred income tax benefit, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and other stock-based payments, loss on early extinguishment of debt, and operating lease amortization. For the year ended December 31, 2021, accounts receivable increased by $1.0 billion and deferred merchant bookings and other current liabilities increased by $1.5 billion, primarily due to increases in business volumes.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $85 million, resulting from net income of $59 million and a favorable impact from adjustments for non-cash items of $1.0 billion, partially offset by an unfavorable net change in working capital and long-term assets and liabilities of $1.0 billion. Non-cash items were principally associated with net gains on marketable equity securities, impairment of goodwill, depreciation and amortization, provision for expected credit losses and chargebacks, stock-based compensation expense and other stock-based payments, deferred income tax expense, and unrealized foreign currency transaction losses related to Euro-denominated debt. For the year ended December 31, 2020, prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased by $161 million, primarily due to a refund for overpayment from a vendor and lower prepayment to third-party payment processors due to decreases in business volumes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the year ended December 31, 2020, accounts receivable decreased by $891 million and deferred merchant bookings and other current liabilities decreased by $2.3 billion primarily due to decreases in business volumes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1.0 billion, resulting from the acquisition of Getaroom of $1.2 billion, proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of $508 million, net of purchases of $17 million, and purchase of property and equipment of $304 million. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2.6 billion, resulting from the proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of $3.0 billion, net of purchases of $74 million, and the purchase of property and equipment of $286 million. Cash invested in the purchase of property and equipment for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 includes payments of $52 million related to the turnkey agreement for constructing Booking.com's future headquarters.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1.2 billion, almost entirely resulting from payments for redemption and conversion of debt of $3.1 billion and payments for the repurchase of common stock of $163 million, partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $2.0 billion.

      "answer": "The combined total of Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities for BKNG in 2021 and GM in 2020 is $2.7 billion. BKNG reported Net Cash Used in Financing Activities of $1.2 billion in 2021, while GM reported Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities of $5.6 billion in 2020. This indicates that BKNG was a net user of cash in financing activities in 2021, primarily due to debt redemption and stock repurchases, whereas GM generated significant cash from financing activities, mainly through debt issuance.",

These are obtained primarily for regulatory purposes and payment guarantees to third-party payment processors.\n\nMarketing expenses and personnel expenses are the most significant operating expenses for our business. We rely on marketing channels to generate a significant amount of traffic to our websites. We have established widely used and recognized ecommerce brands through marketing and promotional campaigns. See our Consolidated Statements of Operations and \"Trends\" and \"Results of Operations\" within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information on marketing expenses and personnel expenses including stock-based compensation expenses.\n\nWe believe that our existing cash balances and liquid resources will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital expenditures, and other obligations through at least the next twelve months. However, if we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to reduce our planned capital expenditures and scale back the scope of our business plans, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, our ability to compete or our future growth prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. If additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of our then current stockholders would be diluted. We may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, revenue growth or sustained profitability may not be realized, and future borrowings or equity sales may not be available in amounts sufficient to make anticipated capital expenditures, finance our strategies, or repay our indebtedness.\n\n## Cash Flow Analysis\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $2.8 billion, resulting from net income of $1.2 billion and a favorable impact from adjustments for non-cash items of $1.4 billion, and a favorable net change in working capital and other long-term assets and liabilities of $269 million. Non-cash items were principally associated with net losses on equity securities, deferred income tax benefit, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and other stock-based payments, loss on early extinguishment of debt, and operating lease amortization. For the year ended December 31, 2021, accounts receivable increased by $1.0 billion and deferred merchant bookings and other current liabilities increased by $1.5 billion, primarily due to increases in business volumes.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $85 million, resulting from net income of $59 million and a favorable impact from adjustments for non-cash items of $1.0 billion, partially offset by an unfavorable net change in working capital and long-term assets and liabilities of $1.0 billion. Non-cash items were principally associated with net gains on marketable equity securities, impairment of goodwill, depreciation and amortization, provision for expected credit losses and chargebacks, stock-based compensation expense and other stock-based payments, deferred income tax expense, and unrealized foreign currency transaction losses related to Euro-denominated debt. For the year ended December 31, 2020, prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased by $161 million, primarily due to a refund for overpayment from a vendor and lower prepayment to third-party payment processors due to decreases in business volumes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the year ended December 31, 2020, accounts receivable decreased by $891 million and deferred merchant bookings and other current liabilities decreased by $2.3 billion primarily due to decreases in business volumes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1.0 billion, resulting from the acquisition of Getaroom of $1.2 billion, proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of $508 million, net of purchases of $17 million, and purchase of property and equipment of $304 million. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2.6 billion, resulting from the proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of $3.0 billion, net of purchases of $74 million, and the purchase of property and equipment of $286 million. Cash invested in the purchase of property and equipment for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 includes payments of $52 million related to the turnkey agreement for constructing Booking.com's future headquarters.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1.2 billion, almost entirely resulting from payments for redemption and conversion of debt of $3.1 billion and payments for the repurchase of common stock of $163 million, partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $2.0 billion. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1.5 billion, almost entirely resulting from the proceeds from the",

Operating Leases\n\n## Operating Leases\n\nOur  portfolio  of  leases  primarily  consists  of  real  estate  office  space,  manufacturing  and  warehousing  facilities,  land  and equipment. Certain leases contain escalation clauses and renewal or purchase options, and generally our leases have no residual value  guarantees  or  material  covenants.  We  exclude  leases  with  a  term  of  one  year  or  less  from  our  balance  sheet,  and  do  not separate non-lease components from our real estate leases.\n\nRent expense under operating leases was $294 million, $317 million and $354 million in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Variable lease costs were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, operating lease right of use assets in Other assets were $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion, operating lease liabilities in Accrued  liabilities  were  $204  million  and  $209  million  and  non-current  operating  lease  liabilities  in  Other  liabilities  were $1.0 billion and $969 million. Operating lease right of use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations were $328 million and $222 million in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.

GM, on the other hand, faces regulatory penalties specifically tied to cybersecurity breaches that could lead to violations of data privacy laws, exposing them to liability and costs related to unauthorized access to customer or proprietary data.

We have invested considerable resources in establishing and maintaining our brands, and intend to continue to invest resources in marketing and other brand building to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our brands.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe compete globally with both online and traditional travel and restaurant reservation and related services. The markets for the services we offer are intensely competitive, constantly evolving, and subject to rapid change, and current and new competitors can launch new services at a relatively low cost. Some of our current and potential competitors, such as Google, Apple, Alibaba, Tencent, Amazon, and Facebook, have significantly more customers or users, consumer data, and financial and other resources than we do, and may be able to leverage other aspects of their businesses (e.g., search or mobile device businesses) to enable them to compete more effectively with us. For example, Google has entered various aspects of the online travel market and has grown rapidly in this area, including by offering a flight meta-search product (\"Google Flights\"), a hotel meta-search product (\"Google Hotel Ads\"), its \"Book on Google\" reservation functionality, Google Travel, a planning tool that aggregates its flight, hotel, and packages products in one website, and by integrating its hotel meta-search products and restaurant information and reservation products into its Google Maps app.\n\nWe currently, or may in the future, compete with a variety of companies, including:\n\n- online travel or restaurant reservation services and meta-search services;\n- large online search, social networking, and marketplace companies;\n- travel service providers such as accommodation providers, rental car or car- or ride-sharing companies, and airlines, and other travel service providers, many of which have their own branded online platforms to which they drive business;\n- traditional travel agencies, travel management companies, wholesalers, and tour operators; and\n- companies offering technology services and software solutions to travel service providers.\n\nFor more information regarding current and potential competitors and the competitive nature of the markets in which we operate, please see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors \"Intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance.\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Government Regulation\n\nOur ability to provide our services and any future services is affected by legal regulations of national and local governments and regulatory authorities around the world, many of which are evolving and subject to new or revised interpretations. Examples of these laws and regulations, which vary and sometimes conflict, include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, the proposed Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act in the European Union, and local laws or regulations relating to corrupt payments to governmental officials or third parties, data privacy requirements, labor relations, nondiscrimination, human rights, anti-human trafficking, taxes, antitrust or competition laws, sanctioned countries or sanctioned persons, and consumer protection laws. Violations could result in fines, penalties, and/or criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, and/or prohibitions on how we conduct or propose to conduct our business. They could also result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our services in one or more countries, delay or prevent potential acquisitions, and materially damage our reputation, brands, global expansion efforts, ability to attract and retain employees and business partners, business, and operating results. Even if we comply with these laws and regulations, doing business in certain jurisdictions or violations of these laws and regulations by the accommodations, restaurants, travel service providers, or other parties with which we conduct business runs the risk of harming our reputation and our brands, which could adversely affect our results of operations or stock price. Regulations that impact our business or our industry include:\n\n- Data Protection and Privacy : Regulatory and legislative activity in the areas of privacy, data protection, and information and cyber security governing parts of our business continues to increase worldwide. We have established and continue to maintain policies and a global governance framework to comply with laws that apply to our business,",

As we continue to assess our performance throughout our regions, we may take additional restructuring actions to rationalize our operations, which may result in material asset write-downs or impairments and reduce our profitability in the periods incurred. In addition, these restructuring actions subject us to increased risks of labor unrest or strikes, supplier, dealer, or other third-party litigation, regulator claims or proceedings, negative publicity  and  business  disruption.  Failure  to  realize  anticipated  savings  or  benefits  from  our  restructuring  and/or  cost  reduction actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity and cash flows.\n\n## Risks related to our intellectual property, cybersecurity, information technology and data management practices\n\nCompetitors  may  independently  develop  products  and  services  similar  to  ours,  and  there  are  no  guarantees  that  GM's intellectual  property  rights  would  prevent  competitors  from  independently  developing  or  selling  those  products  and  services. There may be instances where, notwithstanding our intellectual property position, competitive products or services may impact the value  of  our  brands  and  other  intangible  assets,  and  our  business  may  be  adversely  affected.  Moreover,  although  GM  takes reasonable  steps  to  maintain  the  confidentiality  of  GM  proprietary  information,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  such  efforts  will completely  deter  or  prevent  misappropriation  or  improper  use  of  our  intellectual  property.  We  sometimes  face  attempts  to  gain unauthorized access to our information technology networks and systems for the purpose of improperly acquiring our trade secrets or confidential business information. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position. In addition, we may be the target of patent enforcement actions by third parties, including aggressive and opportunistic enforcement claims by non-practicing entities. Regardless of the merit of such claims, responding to infringement claims can be expensive and time-consuming. Although we have taken steps to mitigate such risks, if we are found to have infringed any third-party intellectual property rights, we could be required to  pay  substantial  damages,  or  we  could  be  enjoined  from  offering  some  of  our  products  and  services.  In  addition,  to  prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property, it may be necessary to prosecute actions for infringement, misappropriation or other violation  of  our  intellectual  property  against  third  parties. Any  such  action  could  result  in  significant  costs  and  diversion  of  our resources and management's attention, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any such action.\n\nSecurity  breaches  and  other  disruptions  to  information  technology  systems  and  networked  products,  including  connected vehicles,  owned  or  maintained  by  us,  GM  Financial,  or  third-parties,  such  as  vendors  or  suppliers,  could  interfere  with  our operations  and  could  compromise  the  confidentiality  of  private  customer  data  or  our  proprietary  information. We rely  upon information technology systems and manufacture networked and connected products, some of which are managed by third parties, to process,  transmit  and  store  electronic  information  and  to  manage  or  support  a  variety  of  our  business  processes,  activities  and products. Additionally, we and GM Financial collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property and proprietary business information  (including  that  of  our  dealers  and  suppliers),  as  well  as  personally  identifiable  information  of  our  customers  and employees, in data centers and on information technology networks (including networks that may be controlled or maintained by third parties). The secure operation of these systems and products, and the processing and maintenance of the information processed by these systems and products, is critical to our business operations and strategy.

      "answer": "A security breach at a third-party marketing affiliate could lead to regulatory penalties for both Booking Holdings and General Motors due to their reliance on third-party systems and data handling practices. Booking Holdings discloses that a breach at a third-party could be perceived as a breach of its own systems, exposing it to liability and regulatory penalties, even without direct involvement. Similarly, General Motors states that cybersecurity incidents could lead to claims of noncompliance with privacy laws, subjecting the company to potential liability or regulatory penalties. Therefore, both companies face exposure to regulatory penalties through third-party breaches, despite not being directly responsible.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Booking Holdings discloses that a third-party security breach could be perceived as a breach of its own systems, leading to regulatory penalties even without direct involvement.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - General Motors acknowledges that cybersecurity disruptions, including those from third parties, could lead to liability or regulatory penalties due to potential noncompliance with privacy laws.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies face regulatory risk from third-party breaches; a breach affecting one could mirror risks faced by the other due to shared exposure through third-party service providers."

These issues are more difficult to manage during any expansion of the number of places where we operate and the variety of services we offer, and as the tools and techniques used in such attacks become more advanced. Our insurance policies have coverage limits and may not be adequate to reimburse us for all losses caused by security breaches. Successful attacks could result in significant interruptions in our operations, severe damage to our information technology infrastructure, negative publicity, damage our reputation, and prevent consumers from using our services during the attack, any of which could cause consumers to use the services of our competitors, which would have a negative effect on the value of our brands, our market share, business, and results of operations.\n\nWe use both internally-developed systems and third-party systems to operate our services, including transaction processing, order management, and financial and accounting systems. If the number of consumers using our services increases substantially, or if critical third-party systems stop operating as designed, we may need to significantly expand and upgrade our technology, transaction processing systems, financial and accounting systems, or other infrastructure. We may not be able to upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate such conditions in a timely manner, and, depending on the systems affected, our transactional, financial, and accounting systems could be impacted for a meaningful amount of time before upgrade, expansion, or repair. Many of our processes and systems, including those related to processing and recording revenue, are highly automated and involve multiple inputs from various IT systems, which can mitigate the risk of human error but which can also make testing, troubleshooting, and auditing more difficult. As a result, it may be difficult to quickly detect and correct errors embedded in these processes or systems.\n\nOur business relies on a global supply chain of third party services providers and we are exposed to risks because we rely on the resilience, security, and legal compliance of their product and services.\n\nWe rely on certain third-party computer systems and third-party service providers, including GDSs and computerized central reservation systems of the accommodation, rental car, and airline industries in connection with providing some of our services. Any damage to, breach of or interruption in these third-party services and systems or deterioration in their performance could prevent us from booking related accommodation, rental car, and airline reservations and have a material adverse effect on our business, brands, and results of operations. Our agreements with some third-party service providers are terminable upon short notice and often do not provide recourse for service interruptions. In the event our arrangement with any such third party is terminated, we may not be able to find an alternative source of systems support on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms and, as a result, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\nConsumers generally are concerned with security and privacy on the internet, and any publicized security problems could negatively affect consumers' willingness to provide private information or effect online commercial transactions generally, including through our services. Some of our business is conducted with third-party marketing affiliates, which may generate travel reservations through our infrastructure or through other systems. A security breach at any third-party, such as the security breach experienced by MGM Resorts International in 2020, could be perceived by consumers as a security breach of our systems and could result in negative publicity, subject us to notification requirements, damage our reputation, expose us to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability, and subject us to regulatory penalties and sanctions, even if we had no direct involvement in the breach. In addition, such third parties may not comply with applicable disclosure requirements or with parameters within which we permit them to process data, which could expose us to liability.\n\nWe depend upon various third parties to process payments, including credit cards, for our merchant transactions around the world. In addition, we rely on third parties to provide credit card numbers which we use as a payment mechanism for merchant transactions. If any such third party were wholly or partially compromised or ceased or suspended operations, our cash flows could be disrupted or we may not be able to generate merchant transactions (and related revenues) for a period of time and this could have a negative effect on our business, reputation, and results of operations and, in certain cases of the insolvency of such a partner, could result in additional payments by us and loss of the total transaction value.",

As we continue to assess our performance throughout our regions, we may take additional restructuring actions to rationalize our operations, which may result in material asset write-downs or impairments and reduce our profitability in the periods incurred. In addition, these restructuring actions subject us to increased risks of labor unrest or strikes, supplier, dealer, or other third-party litigation, regulator claims or proceedings, negative publicity  and  business  disruption.  Failure  to  realize  anticipated  savings  or  benefits  from  our  restructuring  and/or  cost  reduction actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity and cash flows.\n\n## Risks related to our intellectual property, cybersecurity, information technology and data management practices\n\nCompetitors  may  independently  develop  products  and  services  similar  to  ours,  and  there  are  no  guarantees  that  GM's intellectual  property  rights  would  prevent  competitors  from  independently  developing  or  selling  those  products  and  services. There may be instances where, notwithstanding our intellectual property position, competitive products or services may impact the value  of  our  brands  and  other  intangible  assets,  and  our  business  may  be  adversely  affected.  Moreover,  although  GM  takes reasonable  steps  to  maintain  the  confidentiality  of  GM  proprietary  information,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  such  efforts  will completely  deter  or  prevent  misappropriation  or  improper  use  of  our  intellectual  property.  We  sometimes  face  attempts  to  gain unauthorized access to our information technology networks and systems for the purpose of improperly acquiring our trade secrets or confidential business information. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position. In addition, we may be the target of patent enforcement actions by third parties, including aggressive and opportunistic enforcement claims by non-practicing entities. Regardless of the merit of such claims, responding to infringement claims can be expensive and time-consuming. Although we have taken steps to mitigate such risks, if we are found to have infringed any third-party intellectual property rights, we could be required to  pay  substantial  damages,  or  we  could  be  enjoined  from  offering  some  of  our  products  and  services.  In  addition,  to  prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property, it may be necessary to prosecute actions for infringement, misappropriation or other violation  of  our  intellectual  property  against  third  parties. Any  such  action  could  result  in  significant  costs  and  diversion  of  our resources and management's attention, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any such action.\n\nSecurity  breaches  and  other  disruptions  to  information  technology  systems  and  networked  products,  including  connected vehicles,  owned  or  maintained  by  us,  GM  Financial,  or  third-parties,  such  as  vendors  or  suppliers,  could  interfere  with  our operations  and  could  compromise  the  confidentiality  of  private  customer  data  or  our  proprietary  information. We rely  upon information technology systems and manufacture networked and connected products, some of which are managed by third parties, to process,  transmit  and  store  electronic  information  and  to  manage  or  support  a  variety  of  our  business  processes,  activities  and products. Additionally, we and GM Financial collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property and proprietary business information  (including  that  of  our  dealers  and  suppliers),  as  well  as  personally  identifiable  information  of  our  customers  and employees, in data centers and on information technology networks (including networks that may be controlled or maintained by third parties). The secure operation of these systems and products, and the processing and maintenance of the information processed by these systems and products, is critical to our business operations and strategy. Further, customers using our systems rely on the security  of  our  infrastructure,  including  hardware  and  other  elements  provided  by  third  parties,  to  ensure  the  reliability  of  our products and the protection of their data. We also face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints of  any  of  the  third  parties  that  facilitate  our  business  activities,  including  vendors,  service  providers,  suppliers,  customers, counterparties, exchanges, clearing agents, clearinghouses or other financial intermediaries.

We have invested considerable resources in establishing and maintaining our brands, and intend to continue to invest resources in marketing and other brand building to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our brands.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe compete globally with both online and traditional travel and restaurant reservation and related services. The markets for the services we offer are intensely competitive, constantly evolving, and subject to rapid change, and current and new competitors can launch new services at a relatively low cost. Some of our current and potential competitors, such as Google, Apple, Alibaba, Tencent, Amazon, and Facebook, have significantly more customers or users, consumer data, and financial and other resources than we do, and may be able to leverage other aspects of their businesses (e.g., search or mobile device businesses) to enable them to compete more effectively with us. For example, Google has entered various aspects of the online travel market and has grown rapidly in this area, including by offering a flight meta-search product (\"Google Flights\"), a hotel meta-search product (\"Google Hotel Ads\"), its \"Book on Google\" reservation functionality, Google Travel, a planning tool that aggregates its flight, hotel, and packages products in one website, and by integrating its hotel meta-search products and restaurant information and reservation products into its Google Maps app.\n\nWe currently, or may in the future, compete with a variety of companies, including:\n\n- online travel or restaurant reservation services and meta-search services;\n- large online search, social networking, and marketplace companies;\n- travel service providers such as accommodation providers, rental car or car- or ride-sharing companies, and airlines, and other travel service providers, many of which have their own branded online platforms to which they drive business;\n- traditional travel agencies, travel management companies, wholesalers, and tour operators; and\n- companies offering technology services and software solutions to travel service providers.\n\nFor more information regarding current and potential competitors and the competitive nature of the markets in which we operate, please see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors \"Intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance.\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Government Regulation\n\nOur ability to provide our services and any future services is affected by legal regulations of national and local governments and regulatory authorities around the world, many of which are evolving and subject to new or revised interpretations. Examples of these laws and regulations, which vary and sometimes conflict, include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, the proposed Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act in the European Union, and local laws or regulations relating to corrupt payments to governmental officials or third parties, data privacy requirements, labor relations, nondiscrimination, human rights, anti-human trafficking, taxes, antitrust or competition laws, sanctioned countries or sanctioned persons, and consumer protection laws. Violations could result in fines, penalties, and/or criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, and/or prohibitions on how we conduct or propose to conduct our business. They could also result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our services in one or more countries, delay or prevent potential acquisitions, and materially damage our reputation, brands, global expansion efforts, ability to attract and retain employees and business partners, business, and operating results. Even if we comply with these laws and regulations, doing business in certain jurisdictions or violations of these laws and regulations by the accommodations, restaurants, travel service providers, or other parties with which we conduct business runs the risk of harming our reputation and our brands, which could adversely affect our results of operations or stock price. Regulations that impact our business or our industry include:\n\n- Data Protection and Privacy : Regulatory and legislative activity in the areas of privacy, data protection, and information and cyber security governing parts of our business continues to increase worldwide.

However,  hackers  have  reportedly  attempted,  and  may  attempt  in  the  future,  to  gain unauthorized access to modify, alter and use such systems to gain control of, or to change, our vehicles' functionality, user interface and performance characteristics, or to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle. Any unauthorized access to or control of our vehicles or their systems could adversely impact the safety of our customers or result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties. Laws that would permit third-party access to vehicle data and related systems could expose our vehicles and vehicle systems to third-party access without appropriate security measures in place, leading to new safety and security risks for our customers  and  reducing  customer  trust  and  confidence  in  our  products.  In  addition,  regardless  of  their  veracity,  reports  of unauthorized  access  to  our  vehicles  or  their  systems  could  negatively  affect  our  brand  and  harm  our  reputation,  which  could adversely impact our business and operating results.\n\nOur enterprise data practices, including the collection, use, sharing and security of the Personal Identifiable Information of our customers, employees and suppliers, are subject to increasingly complex and restrictive regulations in all key market regions . Under these regulations, the failure to maintain compliant data practices could result in consumer complaints and regulatory inquiry, resulting  in  civil  or  criminal  penalties,  as  well  as  brand  impact  or  other  harm  to  our  business.  In  addition,  increased  consumer sensitivity to real or perceived failures in maintaining acceptable data practices could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users or customers from using our products and services. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations will be high and is likely to increase in the future. The growing patchwork of state and country regulations imposes burdensome obligations on companies to quickly respond to consumer requests, such as requests to delete, disclose and stop selling personal information, with significant fines for noncompliance. Complying with these new laws has significantly increased, and may continue to increase, our operating costs and is driving increased complexity in our operations.\n\n## Risks related to government regulations and litigation\n\nOur  operations  and  products  are  subject  to  extensive  laws,  regulations  and  policies,  including  those  related  to  vehicle emissions  and  fuel  economy  standards,  which  can  significantly  increase  our  costs  and  affect  how  we  do  business. We  are significantly affected by governmental regulations on a global basis that can increase costs related to the production of our vehicles and  affect  our  product  portfolio,  particularly  regulations  relating  to  fuel  economy  standards  and  GHG  emissions.  Meeting  or exceeding the requirements of these regulations is costly, often technologically challenging and may require phase-out of internal combustion  propulsion  in  certain  major  jurisdictions,  and  these  standards  are  often  not  harmonized  across  jurisdictions.  We anticipate that the number and extent of these and other regulations, laws and policies, and the related costs and changes to our product portfolio, may increase significantly in the future, primarily motivated by efforts to reduce GHG emissions. Specifically, fuel economy and GHG emission regulations at the federal, state or local level or in international jurisdictions could require us to further limit the sale of certain profitable products, subsidize the sale of less profitable ones, change our manufacturing processes, pay  penalties  or  undertake  other  activities  that  may  require  us  to  incur  additional  expense,  which  may  be  material.  These requirements  may  increase  the  cost  of,  and/or  diminish  demand  for,  our  vehicles.  These  regulatory  requirements,  among  others, could  significantly  affect  our  plans  for  global  product  development  and,  given  the  uncertainty  surrounding  enforcement  and regulatory  definitions  and  interpretations,  may  result  in  substantial  costs,  including  civil  or  criminal  penalties.  In  addition,  an evolving but un-harmonized emissions and fuel economy regulatory framework that could include specific sales mandates may limit or dictate the types of vehicles we sell and where we sell them, which can affect our revenues. Refer to the 'Environmental and Regulatory Matters' section of Item 1. Business for further information on regulatory and environmental requirements.\n\nWe expect that to  comply  with  fuel  economy  and  GHG  emission  standards  and  mandates  to  sell  specific  volumes  of  ZEV  in certain  jurisdictions,  we  will  be  required  to  sell  a  significant  volume  of  EVs,  and  potentially  develop  and  implement  new technologies for conventional internal combustion engines, all of which will require substantial investment and expense. There are limits on our ability to achieve fuel economy improvements over a given time frame, primarily relating to the cost and effectiveness of  available  technologies,  lack  of  sufficient  consumer  acceptance  of  new  technologies  and  of  changes  in  vehicle  mix,  lack  of willingness  of  consumers  to  absorb  the  additional  costs  of  new  technologies,  the  appropriateness  (or  lack  thereof)  of  certain technologies  for  use  in  particular  vehicles,  the  widespread  availability  (or  lack  thereof)  of  supporting  infrastructure  for  new technologies, especially for EVs, and the human, engineering and financial resources necessary to deploy new technologies across a wide range of products and powertrains in a short time.

      "question": "How could a security breach at a third-party marketing affiliate impact both Booking Holdings' reputation and General Motors' regulatory risk exposure through shared concerns over data privacy and regulatory penalties?",
      "answer": "A security breach at a third-party marketing affiliate could be perceived as a breach of Booking Holdings' systems, resulting in negative publicity, damage to its reputation, and potential liability, even without direct involvement. This reputational damage could drive consumers to competitors, affecting Booking Holdings' market share and results of operations. Simultaneously, General Motors faces regulatory risks related to unauthorized access to vehicle systems or data, which could lead to legal claims, regulatory penalties, and loss of consumer trust. If the breach involved shared consumer data or occurred in a jurisdiction with strict data protection laws, both companies could face overlapping regulatory scrutiny, increasing the likelihood of penalties and compliance costs. This shared exposure to third-party data risks creates a compounding effect on both companies\u2019 reputational and financial standing.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - A security breach at a third-party, such as the security breach experienced by MGM Resorts International in 2020, could be perceived as a breach of Booking Holdings\u2019 systems, resulting in negative publicity, regulatory penalties, and reputational damage.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Unauthorized access to General Motors' vehicle systems or data could lead to legal claims, liability, and regulatory penalties, especially under increasingly complex data privacy regulations in key market regions.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - A breach at a shared third-party marketing affiliate could trigger both reputational harm for Booking Holdings and regulatory penalties for General Motors, especially if consumer data is involved and subject to overlapping jurisdictional laws, thereby linking their exposures through shared data privacy and regulatory risks."

These issues are more difficult to manage during any expansion of the number of places where we operate and the variety of services we offer, and as the tools and techniques used in such attacks become more advanced. Our insurance policies have coverage limits and may not be adequate to reimburse us for all losses caused by security breaches. Successful attacks could result in significant interruptions in our operations, severe damage to our information technology infrastructure, negative publicity, damage our reputation, and prevent consumers from using our services during the attack, any of which could cause consumers to use the services of our competitors, which would have a negative effect on the value of our brands, our market share, business, and results of operations.\n\nWe use both internally-developed systems and third-party systems to operate our services, including transaction processing, order management, and financial and accounting systems. If the number of consumers using our services increases substantially, or if critical third-party systems stop operating as designed, we may need to significantly expand and upgrade our technology, transaction processing systems, financial and accounting systems, or other infrastructure. We may not be able to upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate such conditions in a timely manner, and, depending on the systems affected, our transactional, financial, and accounting systems could be impacted for a meaningful amount of time before upgrade, expansion, or repair. Many of our processes and systems, including those related to processing and recording revenue, are highly automated and involve multiple inputs from various IT systems, which can mitigate the risk of human error but which can also make testing, troubleshooting, and auditing more difficult. As a result, it may be difficult to quickly detect and correct errors embedded in these processes or systems.\n\nOur business relies on a global supply chain of third party services providers and we are exposed to risks because we rely on the resilience, security, and legal compliance of their product and services.\n\nWe rely on certain third-party computer systems and third-party service providers, including GDSs and computerized central reservation systems of the accommodation, rental car, and airline industries in connection with providing some of our services. Any damage to, breach of or interruption in these third-party services and systems or deterioration in their performance could prevent us from booking related accommodation, rental car, and airline reservations and have a material adverse effect on our business, brands, and results of operations. Our agreements with some third-party service providers are terminable upon short notice and often do not provide recourse for service interruptions. In the event our arrangement with any such third party is terminated, we may not be able to find an alternative source of systems support on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms and, as a result, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\nConsumers generally are concerned with security and privacy on the internet, and any publicized security problems could negatively affect consumers' willingness to provide private information or effect online commercial transactions generally, including through our services. Some of our business is conducted with third-party marketing affiliates, which may generate travel reservations through our infrastructure or through other systems. A security breach at any third-party, such as the security breach experienced by MGM Resorts International in 2020, could be perceived by consumers as a security breach of our systems and could result in negative publicity, subject us to notification requirements, damage our reputation, expose us to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability, and subject us to regulatory penalties and sanctions, even if we had no direct involvement in the breach. In addition, such third parties may not comply with applicable disclosure requirements or with parameters within which we permit them to process data, which could expose us to liability.\n\nWe depend upon various third parties to process payments, including credit cards, for our merchant transactions around the world. In addition, we rely on third parties to provide credit card numbers which we use as a payment mechanism for merchant transactions. If any such third party were wholly or partially compromised or ceased or suspended operations, our cash flows could be disrupted or we may not be able to generate merchant transactions (and related revenues) for a period of time and this could have a negative effect on our business, reputation, and results of operations and, in certain cases of the insolvency of such a partner, could result in additional payments by us and loss of the total transaction value.",

However,  hackers  have  reportedly  attempted,  and  may  attempt  in  the  future,  to  gain unauthorized access to modify, alter and use such systems to gain control of, or to change, our vehicles' functionality, user interface and performance characteristics, or to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle. Any unauthorized access to or control of our vehicles or their systems could adversely impact the safety of our customers or result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties. Laws that would permit third-party access to vehicle data and related systems could expose our vehicles and vehicle systems to third-party access without appropriate security measures in place, leading to new safety and security risks for our customers  and  reducing  customer  trust  and  confidence  in  our  products.  In  addition,  regardless  of  their  veracity,  reports  of unauthorized  access  to  our  vehicles  or  their  systems  could  negatively  affect  our  brand  and  harm  our  reputation,  which  could adversely impact our business and operating results.\n\nOur enterprise data practices, including the collection, use, sharing and security of the Personal Identifiable Information of our customers, employees and suppliers, are subject to increasingly complex and restrictive regulations in all key market regions . Under these regulations, the failure to maintain compliant data practices could result in consumer complaints and regulatory inquiry, resulting  in  civil  or  criminal  penalties,  as  well  as  brand  impact  or  other  harm  to  our  business.  In  addition,  increased  consumer sensitivity to real or perceived failures in maintaining acceptable data practices could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users or customers from using our products and services. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations will be high and is likely to increase in the future. The growing patchwork of state and country regulations imposes burdensome obligations on companies to quickly respond to consumer requests, such as requests to delete, disclose and stop selling personal information, with significant fines for noncompliance. Complying with these new laws has significantly increased, and may continue to increase, our operating costs and is driving increased complexity in our operations.\n\n## Risks related to government regulations and litigation\n\nOur  operations  and  products  are  subject  to  extensive  laws,  regulations  and  policies,  including  those  related  to  vehicle emissions  and  fuel  economy  standards,  which  can  significantly  increase  our  costs  and  affect  how  we  do  business. We  are significantly affected by governmental regulations on a global basis that can increase costs related to the production of our vehicles and  affect  our  product  portfolio,  particularly  regulations  relating  to  fuel  economy  standards  and  GHG  emissions.  Meeting  or exceeding the requirements of these regulations is costly, often technologically challenging and may require phase-out of internal combustion  propulsion  in  certain  major  jurisdictions,  and  these  standards  are  often  not  harmonized  across  jurisdictions.  We anticipate that the number and extent of these and other regulations, laws and policies, and the related costs and changes to our product portfolio, may increase significantly in the future, primarily motivated by efforts to reduce GHG emissions. Specifically, fuel economy and GHG emission regulations at the federal, state or local level or in international jurisdictions could require us to further limit the sale of certain profitable products, subsidize the sale of less profitable ones, change our manufacturing processes, pay  penalties  or  undertake  other  activities  that  may  require  us  to  incur  additional  expense,  which  may  be  material.  These requirements  may  increase  the  cost  of,  and/or  diminish  demand  for,  our  vehicles.  These  regulatory  requirements,  among  others, could  significantly  affect  our  plans  for  global  product  development  and,  given  the  uncertainty  surrounding  enforcement  and regulatory  definitions  and  interpretations,  may  result  in  substantial  costs,  including  civil  or  criminal  penalties.  In  addition,  an evolving but un-harmonized emissions and fuel economy regulatory framework that could include specific sales mandates may limit or dictate the types of vehicles we sell and where we sell them, which can affect our revenues. Refer to the 'Environmental and Regulatory Matters' section of Item 1. Business for further information on regulatory and environmental requirements.\n\nWe expect that to  comply  with  fuel  economy  and  GHG  emission  standards  and  mandates  to  sell  specific  volumes  of  ZEV  in certain  jurisdictions,  we  will  be  required  to  sell  a  significant  volume  of  EVs,  and  potentially  develop  and  implement  new technologies for conventional internal combustion engines, all of which will require substantial investment and expense. There are limits on our ability to achieve fuel economy improvements over a given time frame, primarily relating to the cost and effectiveness of  available  technologies,  lack  of  sufficient  consumer  acceptance  of  new  technologies  and  of  changes  in  vehicle  mix,  lack  of willingness  of  consumers  to  absorb  the  additional  costs  of  new  technologies,  the  appropriateness  (or  lack  thereof)  of  certain technologies  for  use  in  particular  vehicles,  the  widespread  availability  (or  lack  thereof)  of  supporting  infrastructure  for  new technologies, especially for EVs, and the human, engineering and financial resources necessary to deploy new technologies across a wide range of products and powertrains in a short time. There is no assurance that we will be able to produce and sell vehicles that use such new technologies on a profitable basis or that our customers will purchase such vehicles in the quantities necessary for us to comply with current or future regulatory requirements.\n\nIn the current uncertain regulatory framework, compliance costs for which we may be responsible and that are not reasonably estimable could be substantial. Alleged violations of fuel economy or emission standards could result in legal proceedings, the recall of  one  or  more  of  our  products,  negotiated  remedial  actions,  fines,  restricted  product  offerings  or  a  combination  of  any  of  those items. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition and operations, including facility idling, reduced employment, increased costs and loss of revenue.",

Marketing expenses consist of performance marketing expenses and brand marketing expenses. Performance marketing expenses are expenses generally measured by return on investment or an increase in bookings over a specified time period. These expenses consist primarily of the costs of: (1) search engine keyword purchases; (2) referrals from meta-search and travel research websites; (3) affiliate programs; (4) offline and online brand marketing; and (5) other performance-based marketing and incentives. Performance marketing expenses are recognized as incurred. Included in \"Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are accrued performance marketing liabilities of $306 million and $156 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Brand marketing expenses are expenses incurred to build brand awareness over a specified time period. These expenses consist primarily of television advertising and online video and display advertising (including the airing of the Company's television advertising online), as well as other marketing expenses such as public relations and sponsorships. Brand marketing expenses are generally recognized as incurred with the exception of advertising production costs, which are deferred and expensed the first time the advertisement is displayed or broadcast.\n\n## Sales and Other Expenses\n\nSales and other expenses are generally variable in nature and consist primarily of: (1) credit cards and other payment processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third parties that provide call center, website content translations, and other services; (3) chargeback provisions and fraud prevention expenses associated with merchant transactions; (4) customer relations costs; and (5) provisions for expected credit losses, primarily related to accommodation commission receivables and prepayments to certain customers.\n\n## Personnel\n\nPersonnel expenses consist of compensation to the Company's personnel, including salaries, stock-based compensation, bonuses, payroll taxes and employee health and other benefits. Included in \"Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are accrued compensation liabilities of $421 million and $333 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nStock-based compensation expense related to performance share units, restricted stock units and stock options is recognized based on fair value on a straight-line basis over the respective requisite service periods and forfeitures are accounted for when they occur. The fair value on the grant date of performance share units and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of units granted and the quoted price of the Company's common stock. For performance share units with market conditions, the effect of the market condition is also considered in the determination of fair value on the grant date using Monte Carlo simulations. The fair value of employee stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes model.\n\nThe Company records stock-based compensation expense for performance-based awards using its estimate of the probable outcome at the end of the performance period (i.e., the estimated performance against the performance targets or performance goals, as applicable). The Company periodically adjusts the cumulative stock-based compensation expense recorded when the probable outcome for these performance-based awards is updated based upon changes in actual and forecasted operating results or expected achievement of performance goals, as applicable.\n\nThe benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs are recognized in the income statement as a discrete item when an option exercise or a vesting and release of shares occurs. Excess tax benefits are presented as operating cash flows and cash payments for employee statutory tax withholding related to vested stock awards are presented as financing cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nSee Note 4 for further information related to stock-based awards.",

Marketing expenses consist of performance marketing expenses and brand marketing expenses. Performance marketing expenses are expenses generally measured by return on investment or an increase in bookings over a specified time period. These expenses consist primarily of the costs of: (1) search engine keyword purchases; (2) referrals from meta-search and travel research websites; (3) affiliate programs; (4) offline and online brand marketing; and (5) other performance-based marketing and incentives. Performance marketing expenses are recognized as incurred. Included in \"Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are accrued performance marketing liabilities of $306 million and $156 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Brand marketing expenses are expenses incurred to build brand awareness over a specified time period. These expenses consist primarily of television advertising and online video and display advertising (including the airing of the Company's television advertising online), as well as other marketing expenses such as public relations and sponsorships. Brand marketing expenses are generally recognized as incurred with the exception of advertising production costs, which are deferred and expensed the first time the advertisement is displayed or broadcast.\n\n## Sales and Other Expenses\n\nSales and other expenses are generally variable in nature and consist primarily of: (1) credit cards and other payment processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third parties that provide call center, website content translations, and other services; (3) chargeback provisions and fraud prevention expenses associated with merchant transactions; (4) customer relations costs; and (5) provisions for expected credit losses, primarily related to accommodation commission receivables and prepayments to certain customers.\n\n## Personnel\n\nPersonnel expenses consist of compensation to the Company's personnel, including salaries, stock-based compensation, bonuses, payroll taxes and employee health and other benefits. Included in \"Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are accrued compensation liabilities of $421 million and $333 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nStock-based compensation expense related to performance share units, restricted stock units and stock options is recognized based on fair value on a straight-line basis over the respective requisite service periods and forfeitures are accounted for when they occur. The fair value on the grant date of performance share units and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of units granted and the quoted price of the Company's common stock. For performance share units with market conditions, the effect of the market condition is also considered in the determination of fair value on the grant date using Monte Carlo simulations. The fair value of employee stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes model.\n\nThe Company records stock-based compensation expense for performance-based awards using its estimate of the probable outcome at the end of the performance period (i.e., the estimated performance against the performance targets or performance goals, as applicable). The Company periodically adjusts the cumulative stock-based compensation expense recorded when the probable outcome for these performance-based awards is updated based upon changes in actual and forecasted operating results or expected achievement of performance goals, as applicable.\n\nThe benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs are recognized in the income statement as a discrete item when an option exercise or a vesting and release of shares occurs. Excess tax benefits are presented as operating cash flows and cash payments for employee statutory tax withholding related to vested stock awards are presented as financing cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nSee Note 4 for further information related to stock-based awards.",

      "answer": "Home Depot compares its cumulative total shareholder returns to the S&P Retail Composite Index and the S&P 500 Index, which are industry-specific and broad market benchmarks relevant to its retail home improvement business. In contrast, McDonald's opts to use the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) companies as its peer group for comparison, citing its global operations and market significance, which align with other large multinational DJIA constituents. As a result, McDonald's shareholder return performance is evaluated against a group of large, globally relevant companies rather than just restaurant peers, which could make its relative performance appear different than if it had used a narrower industry index. This difference in peer selection reflects each company's strategic framing of its investor narrative and market positioning, with Home Depot emphasizing retail relevance and McDonald's emphasizing global brand stature.",

We paid our first cash dividend on June 22, 1987 and have paid a cash dividend during each subsequent quarter.

          "chunk_text": "## STOCK PERFORMANCE GRAPH\n\nAt least annually, McDonald's considers which companies comprise a readily identifiable investment peer group. The Company is included in published restaurant indices; however, unlike most other companies included in these indices, which have no or limited international operations, McDonald's does business in more than 100 countries and a substantial portion of its revenues and income is generated outside the U.S. In addition, because of its size, McDonald's inclusion in those indices tends to skew the results. Therefore, the Company believes that such a comparison is not meaningful.\n\nThe Company's market capitalization, trading volume and importance in an industry that is vital to the U.S. economy have resulted in McDonald's inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (\"DJIA\") since 1985. Like McDonald's, many DJIA companies generate meaningful revenues and income outside the U.S. and some manage global brands. Thus, the Company believes that the use of the DJIA companies as the group for comparison purposes is appropriate.\n\nThe following performance graph shows McDonald's cumulative total shareholder returns (i.e., price appreciation and reinvestment of dividends) relative to the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Stock Index (\"S&amp;P 500 Index\") and to the DJIA companies for the five-year period ended December 31, 2021. The graph assumes that the value of an investment in McDonald's common stock, the S&amp;P 500 Index and the DJIA companies (including McDonald's) was $100 at December 31, 2016. For the DJIA companies, returns are weighted for market capitalization as of the beginning of each period indicated. These returns may vary from those of the DJIA Index, which is not weighted by market capitalization and may be composed of different companies during the period under consideration.\n\n",

In contrast, while MCD also disclosed 'comparable sales increases,' the specific percentage was not provided in the excerpt. However, the availability of detailed metrics for HD and the lack of quantified detail for MCD creates an analytical gap that prevents a full sector-level comparison.

Net property and equipment decreased $0.2 billion in 2021, primarily due to depreciation and the impact of foreign exchange rates. Net property and equipment and the Lease right-of-use asset, net represented approximately 46% and approximately 25%, respectively, of total assets at yearend. Approximately 84% of total assets were in the U.S. and International Operated Markets at year-end 2021.\n\nThe Company's after-tax ROIC from continuing operations is a metric that management believes measures capital-allocation effectiveness over time and was 21.5%, 14.9% and 19.2% as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase from 2020 to 2021 was primarily due to improved operating results and recovery from the impact of COVID-19 as well as lower average debt balances compared to the prior year. Refer to the reconciliation in Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K.\n\n## FINANCING AND MARKET RISK\n\nThe Company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2021 totaled $35.6 billion, compared with $37.4 billion at December 31, 2020. The net decrease in 2021 was due to net repayments of $1.1 billion and the impact of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt of $731 million.\n\n## Debt highlights (1)\n\n",

      "question": "How does the impact of financing availability on franchisee investment affect McDonald's revenue from franchised restaurants, and how might a similar dynamic influence Home Depot's proprietary product strategy given their respective exposures to external financial conditions?",
      "answer": "McDonald's revenue from franchised restaurants depends on franchisees' ability to invest in major initiatives, which is influenced by the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates. If franchisees cannot obtain financing, they may be unable to invest in growth or operational improvements, which could negatively affect McDonald's revenue. Similarly, Home Depot's proprietary product strategy could be impacted by external financial conditions, as economic uncertainty or reduced financing availability could affect supplier relationships and the company's ability to expand its proprietary product offerings. Both companies are exposed to external financial risks, but the mechanism of impact differs\u2014McDonald's through franchisee investment and Home Depot through product sourcing and supplier compliance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_b - McDonald's franchise revenue is dependent on franchisees' ability to invest in initiatives, which is affected by 'availability to them of funding at reasonable interest rates.'",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - Home Depot's proprietary product strategy is exposed to 'uncertainty regarding the housing market, economic conditions, political and social climate, public health issues, and other factors beyond our control,' which includes financing availability.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are impacted by financing availability, but through different mechanisms: McDonald's through franchisee investment in growth initiatives, and Home Depot through supplier relationships and proprietary product expansion."

We seek but may not be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our suppliers and service providers. If we do not have adequate contractual indemnification or insurance available, such claims could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even with adequate insurance and indemnification, our reputation as a provider of high-quality products and services, including both national brand names and our proprietary products, could suffer, damaging our reputation and impacting customer loyalty. In addition, we and our customers have expectations around responsible sourcing, which is an increasing focus of government regulators as well. All of our suppliers must comply with our responsible sourcing standards, which cover a variety of expectations across multiple areas of social compliance, including supply chain transparency, health and safety, environment, compensation, hours of work, and prohibitions on child and forced labor. We have a responsible sourcing audit process, but we are also dependent on our suppliers to ensure that the products and services we provide comply with our standards and applicable law. Actual, potential or perceived supplier non-compliance could expose us to litigation or governmental enforcement actions, and could result in costly product recalls and other liabilities.\n\n## Our proprietary products subject us to certain increased risks, including regulatory, product liability, intellectual property, supplier relations, and reputational risks.\n\nIn addition to other product-related risks discussed in this section, as we expand our proprietary product offerings, we may become subject to increased risks due to our greater role in the design, manufacture, marketing and sale of those products. The risks include greater responsibility to administer and comply with applicable regulatory requirements, increased potential product liability and product recall exposure, and increased potential reputational risks related to the responsible sourcing of those products. To effectively execute on our product differentiation strategy, we must also be able to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties. In addition, an increase in sales of our proprietary products may adversely affect sales of our suppliers' products, which in turn could adversely affect our relationships with certain of our suppliers. Any failure to appropriately address some or all of these risks could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\nIf we are unable to effectively manage our installation services business, we could suffer lost sales and be subject to fines, lawsuits and reputational damage, or the loss of our general contractor licenses.\n\nWe act as a general contractor to provide installation services to our DIFM customers through professional third-party licensed and insured installers. As such, we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, which include management of licensing, permitting, and handling of environmental risks, as well as quality of work performed by our third-party installers. We have established processes and procedures to manage these requirements and manage customer satisfaction with the services provided by our third-party installers. However, as we experienced in part with our recent EPA investigation and resulting consent decree in April 2021, if we fail to manage these processes effectively, collect the appropriate documentation, perform regular job site inspections, or provide proper oversight of these services, we could suffer lost sales, fines, lawsuits, or governmental enforcement actions for violations of regulatory requirements, as well as claims for property damage or personal injury. In addition, we may suffer damage to our reputation or the loss of our general contractor licenses, which could adversely affect our business.\n\n## Legal, Financial, Regulatory, Global and Other External Risks\n\nUncertainty regarding the housing market, economic conditions, political and social climate, public health issues, and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business, and our financial performance.\n\nOur financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing and home improvement markets, as well as general economic conditions, including changes in gross domestic product. Adverse conditions in or uncertainty about these markets, the economy or the political or social climate could adversely impact our customers' confidence or financial condition, causing them to decide against purchasing home improvement products and services, causing them to delay purchasing decisions, or impacting their ability to pay for products and services. Other factors beyond our control - including unemployment and foreclosure rates; inventory loss due to theft; interest rate fluctuations; inflation or deflation; fuel and other energy costs; raw material or other shortages; labor and healthcare costs; the availability of financing; the state of the credit markets, including mortgages, home equity loans and consumer credit; changes in tax rates and policy; weather; natural disasters; climate change; acts of terrorism or violence, including active shooter situations; public health issues, including pandemics and quarantines and related shut-downs, re-openings, or other actions by government regulators or others; military conflicts or acts of war, as well as any related sanctions or other government or private responses; and civil unrest,",

          "chunk_text": "## OPERATIONS\n\n## The global scope of our business subjects us to risks that could negatively affect our business.\n\nWe encounter differing cultural, regulatory, geopolitical and economic environments within and among the more than 100 countries where McDonald's restaurants operate, and our ability to achieve our business objectives depends on the System's success in these environments. Meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our global operating environment, and our global success is partially dependent on our System's ability to leverage operating successes across markets and brand perceptions. Planned initiatives may not have appeal across multiple markets with McDonald's customers and could drive unanticipated changes in customer perceptions and guest counts.\n\nDisruptions in operations or price volatility in a market can also result from governmental actions, such as price, foreign exchange or changes in trade-related tariffs or controls, sanctions and counter sanctions, government-mandated closure of our, our franchisees' or our suppliers' operations, and asset seizures. Trade policies, tariffs and other regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries could adversely affect our business and operations. These and other government actions may impact our results and could cause reputational or other harm. Our international success depends in part on the effectiveness of our strategies and brand-building initiatives to reduce our exposure to such governmental actions.\n\nAdditionally, there are challenges and uncertainties associated with operating in developing markets, which may entail a relatively higher risk of political instability, economic volatility, crime, corruption and social and ethnic unrest. In many cases, such challenges may be exacerbated by the lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainty in how local law is applied and enforced, including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment. An inability to manage effectively the risks associated with our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\n\nWe may also face challenges and uncertainties in developed markets. For example, the U.K.'s exit from the European Union has caused increased regulatory complexities and uncertainty in European economic conditions and may also cause uncertainty in worldwide economic conditions. The decision created volatility in certain foreign currency exchange rates that may or may not continue, and may result in increased supply chain costs for items that are imported from other countries. Any of these effects, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n## Supply chain interruptions may increase costs or reduce revenues.\n\nWe depend on the effectiveness of our supply chain management to assure reliable and sufficient supply of quality products on favorable terms. Although many of the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of suppliers in countries around the world, certain products have limited suppliers, which may increase our reliance on those suppliers. Supply chain interruptions and related price increases can adversely affect us as well as our suppliers and franchisees, whose performance may have a significant impact on our results. Such interruptions and price increases could be caused by shortages, unexpected increases in demand, transportation issues, labor issues, weather-related events, natural disasters or other factors beyond the control of us or our suppliers or franchisees. If we experience interruptions in our System's supply chain, or if contingency planning is not effective, our costs could increase and/or the availability of products critical to our System's operations could be limited.\n\n## Our franchise business model presents a number of risks.\n\nOur success as a heavily franchised business relies to a large degree on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees, including our developmental licensees and affiliates. Our restaurant margins arise from two sources: fees from franchised restaurants (e.g., rent and royalties based on a percentage of sales) and, to a lesser degree, sales from Company-operated restaurants. Our franchisees and developmental licensees manage their businesses independently and therefore are responsible for the day-to-day operation of their restaurants. The revenues we realize from franchised restaurants are largely dependent on the ability of our franchisees to grow their sales. Business risks affecting our operations also affect our franchisees. In particular, our franchisees have also been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the volatility associated with the pandemic. If franchisee sales trends worsen or volatility persists, our financial results could be negatively affected, which may be material.\n\nOur success also relies on the willingness and ability of our independent franchisees and affiliates to implement major initiatives, which may include financial investment, and to remain aligned with us on operating, value/promotional and capital-intensive reinvestment plans. The ability of franchisees to contribute to the achievement of our plans is dependent in large part on the availability to them of funding at reasonable interest rates and may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in general, by their or our creditworthiness or by banks' lending practices. If our franchisees are unwilling or unable to invest in major initiatives or are unable to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates, or at all, our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nOur operating performance could also be negatively affected if our franchisees experience food safety or other operational problems or project an image inconsistent with our brand and values, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited, costly to exercise or subjected to litigation and potential delays. If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our required standards, our brand's image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.\n\nOur ownership mix also affects our results and financial condition. The decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise or license agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex. The benefits of our more heavily franchised structure depend on various factors including whether we have effectively selected franchisees, licensees and/or affiliates that meet our rigorous standards, whether we are able to successfully integrate them into our structure and whether their performance and the resulting ownership mix supports our brand and financial objectives.",

As of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, our performance obligations for unredeemed gift cards were $1.0 billion and $839 million, respectively. Gift card breakage income, which is our estimate of the portion of our gift card balance not expected to be redeemed, is recognized in net sales and was immaterial in fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020, and fiscal 2019.\n\nWe also have agreements with third-party service providers who directly extend credit to customers, manage our PLCC program, and own the related receivables. We have evaluated the third-party entities holding the receivables under the program and concluded that they should not be consolidated. The agreement with the primary third-party service provider for our PLCC program expires in 2028, with us having the option, but no obligation, to purchase the existing receivables at the end of the agreement. Deferred interest charges incurred for our deferred financing programs offered to these customers, interchange fees charged to us for their use of the cards, and any profit sharing with the third-party service providers are included in net sales.\n\n## Cost of Sales\n\nCost of sales includes the actual cost of merchandise sold and services performed; the cost of transportation of merchandise from vendors to our distribution network, stores, or customers; shipping and handling costs from our stores or distribution network to customers; and the operating cost and depreciation of our sourcing and distribution network. Vendor allowances that are not reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs are also included within cost of sales.\n\n## Vendor Allowances\n\nVendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and co-op advertising allowances for the promotion of vendors' products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels. These vendor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases. Volume rebates and certain co-op advertising allowances reduce the carrying cost of inventory and are recognized in cost of sales when the related inventory is sold.\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include compensation and benefits for retail and store support center associates, occupancy and operating costs of retail locations and store support centers, insurance-related expenses, advertising costs, credit and debit card processing fees, and other administrative costs.\n\n## Advertising Expense\n\nAdvertising costs, including digital, television, radio and print, are expensed when the advertisement first appears. Certain co-op advertising allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors' products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense.

          "chunk_text": "## REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nThe Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to developmental licensees and affiliates include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. The Company's Other revenues are comprised of fees paid by franchisees to recover a portion of costs incurred by the Company for various technology platforms, revenues from brand licensing arrangements to market and sell consumer packaged goods using the McDonald's brand and third party revenues for the Dynamic Yield business.\n\nSales by Company-operated restaurants are recognized on a cash basis at the time of the underlying sale and are presented net of sales tax and other sales-related taxes. Royalty revenues are based on a percent of sales and recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Rental income includes both minimum rent payments, which are recognized straight-line over the franchise term (with the exception of rent concessions as a result of COVID-19 - refer to the Leasing section that follows) and variable rent payments based on a percent of sales, which are recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Initial fees are recognized as the Company satisfies the performance obligation over the franchise term, which is generally 20 years.\n\nThe Company provides goods or services related to various technology platforms to certain franchisees that are distinct from the franchise agreement because they do not require integration with other goods or services that the Company provides. The Company has determined that it is the principal in these arrangements. Accordingly, the related revenue is presented on a gross basis on the Consolidated Statement of Income. These revenues are recognized as the goods or services are transferred to the franchisee, and related expenses are recognized as incurred. Brand licensing arrangement revenues are based on a percent of sales and are recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Dynamic Yield third party revenues are generated from providing software as a service solutions to customers and are recognized over the applicable subscription period as the service is performed.\n\n## PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and amortization provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildings-up to 40 years; leasehold improvements-the lesser of useful lives of assets or lease terms, which generally include certain option periods; and equipment-3 to 12 years.\n\nThe Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods.\n\nThe Company may share in the cost of certain restaurant improvements with its franchisees, primarily in the U.S. Since McDonald's manages the project and provides up front funding in these instances, during the project the Company estimates which costs are the responsibility of McDonald's and which are the responsibility of the franchisee, and allocates the corresponding costs between Property and equipment and Accounts receivable. Upon the completion of the project, the allocation of costs is finalized and may result in immaterial adjustments to the balances and associated depreciation expense.\n\nRefer to the Property and Equipment footnote on page 51 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\n\n## LEASING\n\nThe Company is the lessee in a significant real estate portfolio, primarily through ground leases (the Company leases the land and generally owns the building) and through improved leases (the Company leases the land and buildings). The Lease right-of-use asset and Lease liability reflect the present value of the Company's estimated future minimum lease payments over the lease term, which includes options that are reasonably assured of being exercised, discounted using the rate implicit in each lease, if determinable, or a collateralized incremental borrowing rate considering the term of the lease and particular currency environment. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less, primarily related to leases of office equipment, are not included in the Lease right-or-use asset or Lease liability and continue to be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThe Company has elected not to separate non-lease components from lease components in its lessee portfolio. To the extent that occupancy costs, such as site maintenance, are included in the asset and liability, the impact is immaterial and is generally limited to Company-owned restaurant locations. For franchised locations, which represent the majority of the restaurant portfolio, the related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and site maintenance are generally required to be paid by the franchisees as part of the franchise arrangement. In addition, the Company is the lessee under non-restaurant related leases such as office buildings, vehicles and office equipment. These leases are not a material subset of the Company's lease portfolio.\n\nIn 2020, the Company elected the practical expedient to account for COVID-19 related rent concessions as if they were part of the enforceable rights and obligations of the parties under the existing lease contract. This was elected for the Company's entire lessee and lessor portfolio for any rent deferrals or rent abatements. For the lessee portfolio, the Company elected not to remeasure the Lease right- of-use asset and Lease liability if a rent deferral or a rent abatement was granted. Refer to the Leasing Arrangements footnote on page 52 of this Form 10-K for additional information on the Lease right-of-use asset and Lease liability.\n\nThe Company deferred collection of approximately $490 million of rental income on revenue that was recognized in 2020, and has collected substantially all of these deferrals as of December 31, 2021. Rental income includes both minimum rent payments and variable rent payments based on a percent of sales.\n\nRefer to the Franchise Arrangements footnote on page 51 of this Form 10-K for additional information on deferred collections of rental income as well as royalties.",

      "question": "How does the difference in depreciation methods for property and equipment between HD and MCD affect their long-term asset management strategies?",
      "answer": "HD uses the straight-line method for depreciating buildings and related improvements, furniture, fixtures, and equipment over their estimated useful lives, while MCD also uses the straight-line method but specifies different useful life ranges\u2014buildings up to 40 years, leasehold improvements based on the lesser of asset life or lease terms, and equipment between 3 to 12 years. This difference in depreciation policy specificity allows MCD to adjust asset valuations more dynamically based on economic and technological changes, potentially influencing when asset write-offs or accelerated depreciation occur. HD's approach, by contrast, appears more static, which may limit flexibility in responding to rapid changes in asset utility. These differing methods reflect contrasting long-term asset management strategies: HD emphasizes consistency, while MCD emphasizes adaptability.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - HD depreciates property and equipment using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives without specifying ranges.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - The specificity and flexibility in MCD\u2019s depreciation policy enable more responsive asset management, while HD\u2019s method implies a more consistent but less dynamic approach."

Shrink (or in the case of excess inventory, swell) is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory count. We calculate shrink based on actual inventory losses identified as a result of physical inventory counts during each fiscal period and estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts. The estimate for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical inventory counts is calculated on a store-specific basis and is primarily based on recent shrink results. Historically, the difference between estimated shrink and actual inventory losses has not been material to our annual financial results.\n\nDue to changes in operating conditions during fiscal 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we used the results from a sample of stores that were able to conduct physical inventories as a basis for estimating shrink for those stores at which physical inventory counts were temporarily suspended during fiscal 2020. We believe the sample of stores that were selected for inventory counts in fiscal 2020 provided a reasonable basis for estimating shrink where a physical inventory count was not performed in fiscal 2020. During fiscal 2021, we performed all regularly scheduled physical inventory counts, including store locations where physical inventory counts were suspended during fiscal 2020, and the difference between estimated shrink and actual inventory losses was not material.\n\n## Property and Equipment\n\nBuildings and related improvements, furniture, fixtures, and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements and assets held under finance leases are amortized using the straight-line method over the original term of the lease or the useful life of the asset, whichever is shorter.\n\nThe following table presents the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment:\n\n",

In addition, the Company's subsidiaries had unused lines of credit that were primarily uncommitted, short-term and denominated in various currencies at local market rates of interest.\n\nThe weighted-average interest rate of short-term borrowings was 2.4% at December 31, 2021 (based on $263.1 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings) and 1.9% at December 31, 2020 (based on $265.7 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings).\n\n## DEBT OBLIGATIONS\n\nThe Company has incurred debt obligations principally through public and private offerings and bank loans. There are no provisions in the Company's debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Company's business. Certain of the Company's debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions, and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. Under certain agreements, the Company has the option to retire debt prior to maturity, either at par or at a premium over par. The Company has no current plans to retire a significant amount of its debt prior to maturity, but continues to look for ways to optimize its debt portfolio.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Company's debt obligations (interest rates and debt amounts reflected in the table include the effects of interest rate swaps used to hedge debt).\n\n",

Shrink (or in the case of excess inventory, swell) is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory count. We calculate shrink based on actual inventory losses identified as a result of physical inventory counts during each fiscal period and estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts. The estimate for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical inventory counts is calculated on a store-specific basis and is primarily based on recent shrink results. Historically, the difference between estimated shrink and actual inventory losses has not been material to our annual financial results.\n\nDue to changes in operating conditions during fiscal 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we used the results from a sample of stores that were able to conduct physical inventories as a basis for estimating shrink for those stores at which physical inventory counts were temporarily suspended during fiscal 2020. We believe the sample of stores that were selected for inventory counts in fiscal 2020 provided a reasonable basis for estimating shrink where a physical inventory count was not performed in fiscal 2020. During fiscal 2021, we performed all regularly scheduled physical inventory counts, including store locations where physical inventory counts were suspended during fiscal 2020, and the difference between estimated shrink and actual inventory losses was not material.\n\n## Property and Equipment\n\nBuildings and related improvements, furniture, fixtures, and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements and assets held under finance leases are amortized using the straight-line method over the original term of the lease or the useful life of the asset, whichever is shorter.\n\nThe following table presents the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment:\n\n",

Our investments in our stores may not deliver the relevant shopping experience our customers expect or fully support an interconnected shopping experience. We must also maintain a safe store environment for our customers and associates, as well as protect against loss or theft of our inventory (also called 'shrink'). Higher rates of shrink, which we continue to experience, can require operational changes that may increase costs and impact the customer experience.\n\nOur investments to enhance our interconnected shopping experience and expand our supply chain might not provide the anticipated benefits, might take longer than expected to complete or realize anticipated benefits, or might fail altogether, each of which could adversely impact our competitive position and our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\nIf we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of both brand name and proprietary products, we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors.\n\nAs part of our focus on product differentiation, we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of well-recognized brand names. We have also developed relationships with selected suppliers to allow us to market proprietary products that are comparable to national brands. Our proprietary products differentiate us from other retailers, generally carry higher margins than national brand products, and represent a growing portion of our business. If we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships, maintain favorable terms with current suppliers, or identify alternative sources for comparable brand name and proprietary products, we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation, which may impact our sales and gross margin results.\n\nOur strategic transactions involve risks, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions.\n\nWe regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions, investments, alliances, and other growth and market expansion strategies, such as our acquisition of HD Supply in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. We generally expect that these transactions will result in sales increases, cost savings, synergies, enhanced capabilities or various other benefits. Assessing the viability and realizing the benefits of these transactions is subject to significant uncertainty. For each of our acquisitions, we need to determine the appropriate level of integration of the target company's products, services, associates, and information technology, financial, human resources, compliance, and other systems and processes, and then successfully manage that integration into our corporate structure. Integration can be a complex and time-consuming process, and if the integration is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of time, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies or benefits of the acquisition. In addition, the integration of businesses may create complexity in our financial systems, internal controls, technology and cybersecurity systems, and operations and make them more difficult to manage. Furthermore, even if the target companies are successfully integrated, the acquisitions may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated, expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products or services, and expose us to additional risks and liabilities. Strategic transactions may also be subject to significant regulatory uncertainty. The changing enforcement landscape may result in additional costs or delays that affect the anticipated outcome of a transaction. Any failure in the execution of a strategic transaction, our approach to the integration of an acquired asset or business, or achieving expected synergies or other benefits could result in slower growth, higher than expected costs, the recording of an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, and other actions which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Operational Risks\n\nOur success depends upon our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified associates to provide excellent customer service and to support our strategic initiatives while also controlling our labor costs.\n\nOur customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates. To meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we must attract, develop and retain a large number of highly qualified associates. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including increased market pressures with respect to prevailing wage rates, unemployment levels, and health and other insurance costs; the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations, immigration, minimum wage, and healthcare benefits; changing demographics; the continuing impacts of the pandemic; and our reputation within the labor market. We also compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions, and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction. These positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs, particularly in a competitive labor market.

A failure, whether real or perceived, to address ESG matters or to achieve progress on our ESG initiatives could adversely affect our business, including by heightening other risks disclosed in these Risk Factors, such as those related to consumer behavior, consumer perceptions of our brand, labor availability and costs, supply chain interruptions, commodity costs, and legal and regulatory complexity. Conversely, our taking a position, whether real or perceived, on ESG, public policy, geopolitical and similar matters could adversely impact our business.\n\nThe standards we set for ourselves regarding ESG matters, and our ability to meet such standards, may also impact our business. For example, we are working to manage risks and costs to our System related to climate change, greenhouse gases, and diminishing energy and water resources, and we have announced initiatives relating to, among other things, environmental sustainability, responsible sourcing and increasing diverse representation across our System. We may face increased scrutiny related to reporting on and achieving these initiatives, as well as continued public focus on similar matters, such as packaging and waste, animal health and welfare, deforestation and land use. We may also face increased pressure from stakeholders to provide expanded disclosure and establish additional commitments, targets or goals, and take actions to meet them, which could expose us to additional market, operational, execution and reputational costs and risks. Moreover, addressing ESG matters requires Systemwide coordination and alignment, and the standards by which certain ESG matters are measured are evolving and subject to assumptions that could change over time.\n\n## Events such as severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, among others, can adversely affect our results and prospects.\n\nSevere weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, climate change or terrorist activities (or expectations about them) can adversely affect consumer behavior and confidence levels, supply availability and costs and local operations in impacted markets, all of which can affect our results and prospects. Climate change may also increase the frequency and severity of such weather-related events and natural disasters. Our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to some of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to cover our losses fully.\n\n## LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n\nThe Company has pending a number of lawsuits that have been filed in various jurisdictions. These lawsuits cover a broad variety of allegations spanning the Company's business. The following is a brief description of the more significant types of such claims and lawsuits. In addition, the Company is subject to various national and local laws and regulations that impact various aspects of its business, as discussed under 'Government Regulations' below. While the Company does not believe that any such claims, lawsuits, laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations, unfavorable rulings could occur.

Occasional disputes also arise between the Company and individuals who claim they should have been granted a franchise or who challenge the legal distinction between the Company and its franchisees for employment law purposes.\n\n## \u25aa Suppliers\n\nThe Company and its affiliates and subsidiaries generally do not supply food, paper or related items to any McDonald's restaurants. The Company relies upon numerous independent suppliers, including service providers, that are required to meet and maintain the Company's high standards and specifications. On occasion, disputes arise between the Company and its current or former suppliers relating to, for example, compliance with product specifications and the Company's business relationship with suppliers. Occasional disputes also arise between the Company and individuals or entities who claim that they should be (or should have been) granted the opportunity to supply products or services to the Company's restaurants.\n\n## \u25aa Employees\n\nHundreds of thousands of people are employed by the Company and in restaurants owned and operated by subsidiaries of the Company. In addition, thousands of people from time to time seek employment in such restaurants.

Certain merchandise categories have been impacted by higher inflation than that which we have experienced in recent years due to, among other things, the continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, related global supply chain disruptions, and the uncertain economic and geopolitical environment. If inflation increases costs beyond our ability to control, we may not be able to adjust prices or use our portfolio strategy to sufficiently offset the effect without negatively impacting consumer demand or our gross margin. Further, our MRO customers, who have higher spend and longer-term relationships than a typical retail customer, primarily use trade credit to finance their purchases, and some of our Pros use trade credit in order to purchase our products. As a result, their ability to pay is highly dependent on the economic strength of the industry in their area. If these customers are unable to repay the trade credit from us, we may face greater default risk, which could reduce our cash flow and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nThe continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are highly unpredictable, volatile, and uncertain, and could adversely affect our business operations, demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business, availability of labor, access to inventory, supply chain operations, our ability to predict future performance, our exposure to litigation, and our financial performance, among other things.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant public health concerns as well as economic disruption, uncertainty, and volatility, all of which have impacted and are expected to continue to impact our business. While we have taken numerous steps to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our results of operations, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. Even as efforts to contain the pandemic, including vaccinations, have fostered progress, and as some restrictions have relaxed, new variants of the virus have caused additional outbreaks, which has introduced additional uncertainty and volatility. Due to numerous uncertainties and factors beyond our control, we are unable to predict the impact that the pandemic and recovery efforts will have going forward on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. These factors and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:\n\n- the severity and duration of the pandemic, including whether there are additional 'waves' or other continued periods of increases or spikes in the number of COVID-19 cases (including those caused by current or future mutations of the virus or related variants) in future periods in areas in which we or our suppliers operate;\n- the rapidly changing and fluid circumstances caused by the pandemic and efforts to contain and recover from it and our ability to respond quickly enough or appropriately to those circumstances;\n- the duration and degree of governmental, business or other actions in response to the pandemic, including but not limited to quarantine or shut-down measures and other governmental orders; masking, vaccination or testing requirements; restrictions on our operations up to and including complete or partial closure of our stores, facilities, and distribution and fulfillment centers; economic measures; access to unemployment compensation; fiscal policy changes; or additional measures that may yet be enacted;\n- the health of, and effect of the pandemic on, our associates and our ability to maintain staffing needs to effectively operate our business, including the impact of and uncertainty related to vaccination or testing efforts;\n- changes in labor markets affecting us and our suppliers, including labor shortages;\n- evolving macroeconomic factors, including general economic uncertainty, unemployment rates, inflation and deflation, rising interest rates, and recessionary pressures;\n- the impact of the pandemic and related economic uncertainty on consumer confidence, economic well-being, spending, and shopping behaviors, both during and after the pandemic;\n- impacts - financial, operational or otherwise - on our supply chain, including manufacturers or suppliers of our products and logistics or transportation providers, and on our service providers, subcontractors, or other business partners;\n- unknown consequences on our business performance and strategic initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time and other resources to the pandemic response;\n- the incremental costs of doing business during and/or after the pandemic, including the potential costs of ongoing testing requirements;\n- volatility in the credit and financial markets during and after the pandemic;\n- the effects on our internal control environment and data security as a result of the remote and hybrid work environment;",

Meanwhile, MCD's SG&A expenses increased by 6% in 2021, driven by higher incentive-based compensation and investments in restaurant technology, which were analyzed as a percent of Systemwide sales to reflect the broader impact on operational efficiency.

      "answer": "HD reports an estimated useful life of 5-45 years for leasehold improvements, while MCD depreciates leasehold improvements using the lesser of the asset's useful life or the lease term, which generally includes certain option periods. This difference suggests that HD may adopt a more standardized approach to depreciation over a fixed range, whereas MCD tailors depreciation timelines based on lease agreements. As a result, MCD may experience more variability in annual depreciation expense depending on lease structures, while HD's approach could lead to more predictable long-term expense patterns.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - HD specifies 5-45 years for leasehold improvements, indicating a broad standardized range for depreciation.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - MCD uses the lesser of the useful life or lease term, which introduces variability based on lease conditions.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The differing approaches imply distinct strategies: HD\u2019s fixed range leads to predictable depreciation, while MCD\u2019s lease-dependent method results in variable expense recognition."

          "chunk_text": "## REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nThe Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to developmental licensees and affiliates include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. The Company's Other revenues are comprised of fees paid by franchisees to recover a portion of costs incurred by the Company for various technology platforms, revenues from brand licensing arrangements to market and sell consumer packaged goods using the McDonald's brand and third party revenues for the Dynamic Yield business.\n\nSales by Company-operated restaurants are recognized on a cash basis at the time of the underlying sale and are presented net of sales tax and other sales-related taxes. Royalty revenues are based on a percent of sales and recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Rental income includes both minimum rent payments, which are recognized straight-line over the franchise term (with the exception of rent concessions as a result of COVID-19 - refer to the Leasing section that follows) and variable rent payments based on a percent of sales, which are recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Initial fees are recognized as the Company satisfies the performance obligation over the franchise term, which is generally 20 years.\n\nThe Company provides goods or services related to various technology platforms to certain franchisees that are distinct from the franchise agreement because they do not require integration with other goods or services that the Company provides. The Company has determined that it is the principal in these arrangements. Accordingly, the related revenue is presented on a gross basis on the Consolidated Statement of Income. These revenues are recognized as the goods or services are transferred to the franchisee, and related expenses are recognized as incurred. Brand licensing arrangement revenues are based on a percent of sales and are recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Dynamic Yield third party revenues are generated from providing software as a service solutions to customers and are recognized over the applicable subscription period as the service is performed.\n\n## PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and amortization provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildings-up to 40 years; leasehold improvements-the lesser of useful lives of assets or lease terms, which generally include certain option periods; and equipment-3 to 12 years.\n\nThe Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods.\n\nThe Company may share in the cost of certain restaurant improvements with its franchisees, primarily in the U.S. Since McDonald's manages the project and provides up front funding in these instances, during the project the Company estimates which costs are the responsibility of McDonald's and which are the responsibility of the franchisee, and allocates the corresponding costs between Property and equipment and Accounts receivable. Upon the completion of the project, the allocation of costs is finalized and may result in immaterial adjustments to the balances and associated depreciation expense.\n\nRefer to the Property and Equipment footnote on page 51 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\n\n## LEASING\n\nThe Company is the lessee in a significant real estate portfolio, primarily through ground leases (the Company leases the land and generally owns the building) and through improved leases (the Company leases the land and buildings). The Lease right-of-use asset and Lease liability reflect the present value of the Company's estimated future minimum lease payments over the lease term, which includes options that are reasonably assured of being exercised, discounted using the rate implicit in each lease, if determinable, or a collateralized incremental borrowing rate considering the term of the lease and particular currency environment. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less, primarily related to leases of office equipment, are not included in the Lease right-or-use asset or Lease liability and continue to be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThe Company has elected not to separate non-lease components from lease components in its lessee portfolio. To the extent that occupancy costs, such as site maintenance, are included in the asset and liability, the impact is immaterial and is generally limited to Company-owned restaurant locations. For franchised locations, which represent the majority of the restaurant portfolio, the related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and site maintenance are generally required to be paid by the franchisees as part of the franchise arrangement. In addition, the Company is the lessee under non-restaurant related leases such as office buildings, vehicles and office equipment. These leases are not a material subset of the Company's lease portfolio.\n\nIn 2020, the Company elected the practical expedient to account for COVID-19 related rent concessions as if they were part of the enforceable rights and obligations of the parties under the existing lease contract. This was elected for the Company's entire lessee and lessor portfolio for any rent deferrals or rent abatements. For the lessee portfolio, the Company elected not to remeasure the Lease right- of-use asset and Lease liability if a rent deferral or a rent abatement was granted. Refer to the Leasing Arrangements footnote on page 52 of this Form 10-K for additional information on the Lease right-of-use asset and Lease liability.\n\nThe Company deferred collection of approximately $490 million of rental income on revenue that was recognized in 2020, and has collected substantially all of these deferrals as of December 31, 2021. Rental income includes both minimum rent payments and variable rent payments based on a percent of sales.\n\nRefer to the Franchise Arrangements footnote on page 51 of this Form 10-K for additional information on deferred collections of rental income as well as royalties.",

HD's net cash provided by operating activities was $16,571 million and MCD's was $9,141.5 million in the same year.

      "answer": "HD includes a stockholders' equity section in its consolidated financial statements, indicating a positive or neutral equity position, while MCD reports a total shareholders' equity deficit of $4,601 million in 2022, showing negative equity. This difference highlights contrasting financial positions, with HD likely maintaining a stronger balance sheet relative to MCD.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - HD includes a stockholders' equity section in its consolidated financial statements, suggesting a standard reporting of equity components.",

      "answer": "Currency exchange rate fluctuations increase the cost of imported goods for Home Depot by affecting its global suppliers, potentially leading to higher product costs and reduced margins. For McDonald's, exchange rate volatility impacts international operations by increasing supply chain costs for imported items, particularly in markets like the U.K. following Brexit. These fluctuations introduce risks of reduced profitability and operational inefficiencies for both companies due to increased input costs and pricing instability.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Home Depot\u2019s supplier costs are affected by currency exchange rates, which can increase the price of imported goods and affect gross margins.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - McDonald's notes that post-Brexit exchange rate volatility has increased supply chain costs for imported items, impacting financial performance.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are exposed to currency exchange rate risks, though through different mechanisms: supplier pricing for Home Depot and international supply chain costs for McDonald's. These risks can lead to higher operating costs and reduced profitability."

As a result, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\n\nOur business is subject to seasonal influences, and uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions, climate change, natural disasters, as well as other catastrophic events, could impact our operations.\n\nNatural disasters, such as hurricanes and tropical storms, fires, floods, droughts, tornadoes, and earthquakes; unseasonable, or unexpected or extreme weather conditions, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise; acts of terrorism or violence, including active shooter situations; public health concerns, such as pandemics and quarantines and related shut-downs, re-openings, or other actions by government regulators or others; civil unrest; military conflicts or acts of war, as well as any related sanctions or other government or private responses; or similar disruptions and catastrophic events can affect consumer spending and confidence and consumers' disposable income, particularly with respect to home improvement or construction projects, and could have an adverse effect on our financial performance. These types of events can also adversely affect our work force and prevent associates and customers from reaching our stores and other facilities. They can also, temporarily or on a long-term basis, disrupt or disable operations of stores, support centers, and portions of our supply chain and distribution network, including causing reductions in the availability of inventory and disruption of utility services. In addition, these events may affect our information systems and digital platforms, resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations, including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders; to communicate with our stores, facilities, store support centers or senior management; or to access financial or banking systems. Unseasonable, unexpected or extreme weather conditions such as excessive precipitation, warm temperatures during the winter season, or prolonged or extreme periods of warm or cold temperatures, could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with customer needs.\n\nFurthermore, the long-term impacts of climate change, whether involving physical risks (such as extreme weather conditions or rising sea levels) or transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes) are expected to be widespread and unpredictable. These changes over time could affect, for example, the availability and cost of certain consumer products, commodities, and energy (including utilities), which in turn may impact our ability to procure certain goods or services required for the operation of our business at the quantities and levels we require.\n\nAs a consequence of these or other catastrophic or uncharacteristic events, we may experience interruption to our operations, increased costs, or losses of property, equipment or inventory, which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\n\nIf we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, or if our suppliers experience financial difficulties or other challenges, our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected.\n\nWe buy our products from suppliers located throughout the world, who in turn procure materials from around the world. Our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and responsible sourcing, as well as our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner, is a significant challenge. Our ability to access products from our suppliers can be adversely affected by economic or political instability; civil unrest; military conflicts or acts of war, as well as any related sanctions or other government or private responses; acts of terrorism or violence; public health issues (including pandemics and quarantines and related shut-downs, re-openings, or other actions by the government); the financial instability of suppliers; suppliers' noncompliance with applicable laws; trade restrictions; tariffs; currency exchange rates; any disruptions in our suppliers' logistics or supply chain networks or information technology systems; raw material or other shortages; and other factors beyond our or our suppliers' control. If we are unable to access products to meet our customers' demands and expectations in a timely and efficient manner, our sales and gross margin results may be adversely impacted.\n\nFailure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality and safety and ensure compliance with responsible sourcing laws and standards could damage our reputation with customers, expose us to litigation or enforcement actions, and negatively impact our sales and results of operations.\n\nProduct and service quality issues could negatively impact customer confidence in our brands and our Company. If our product and service offerings do not meet applicable product standards or our customers' expectations regarding safety or quality, we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal, financial and reputational risks, as well as governmental enforcement actions.

Meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our global operating environment, and our global success is partially dependent on our System's ability to leverage operating successes across markets and brand perceptions. Planned initiatives may not have appeal across multiple markets with McDonald's customers and could drive unanticipated changes in customer perceptions and guest counts.\n\nDisruptions in operations or price volatility in a market can also result from governmental actions, such as price, foreign exchange or changes in trade-related tariffs or controls, sanctions and counter sanctions, government-mandated closure of our, our franchisees' or our suppliers' operations, and asset seizures. Trade policies, tariffs and other regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries could adversely affect our business and operations. These and other government actions may impact our results and could cause reputational or other harm. Our international success depends in part on the effectiveness of our strategies and brand-building initiatives to reduce our exposure to such governmental actions.\n\nAdditionally, there are challenges and uncertainties associated with operating in developing markets, which may entail a relatively higher risk of political instability, economic volatility, crime, corruption and social and ethnic unrest. In many cases, such challenges may be exacerbated by the lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainty in how local law is applied and enforced, including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment. An inability to manage effectively the risks associated with our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\n\nWe may also face challenges and uncertainties in developed markets. For example, the U.K.'s exit from the European Union has caused increased regulatory complexities and uncertainty in European economic conditions and may also cause uncertainty in worldwide economic conditions. The decision created volatility in certain foreign currency exchange rates that may or may not continue, and may result in increased supply chain costs for items that are imported from other countries. Any of these effects, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n## Supply chain interruptions may increase costs or reduce revenues.\n\nWe depend on the effectiveness of our supply chain management to assure reliable and sufficient supply of quality products on favorable terms. Although many of the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of suppliers in countries around the world, certain products have limited suppliers, which may increase our reliance on those suppliers. Supply chain interruptions and related price increases can adversely affect us as well as our suppliers and franchisees, whose performance may have a significant impact on our results. Such interruptions and price increases could be caused by shortages, unexpected increases in demand, transportation issues, labor issues, weather-related events, natural disasters or other factors beyond the control of us or our suppliers or franchisees. If we experience interruptions in our System's supply chain, or if contingency planning is not effective, our costs could increase and/or the availability of products critical to our System's operations could be limited.\n\n## Our franchise business model presents a number of risks.\n\nOur success as a heavily franchised business relies to a large degree on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees, including our developmental licensees and affiliates. Our restaurant margins arise from two sources: fees from franchised restaurants (e.g., rent and royalties based on a percentage of sales) and, to a lesser degree, sales from Company-operated restaurants. Our franchisees and developmental licensees manage their businesses independently and therefore are responsible for the day-to-day operation of their restaurants. The revenues we realize from franchised restaurants are largely dependent on the ability of our franchisees to grow their sales. Business risks affecting our operations also affect our franchisees. In particular, our franchisees have also been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the volatility associated with the pandemic. If franchisee sales trends worsen or volatility persists, our financial results could be negatively affected, which may be material.\n\nOur success also relies on the willingness and ability of our independent franchisees and affiliates to implement major initiatives, which may include financial investment, and to remain aligned with us on operating, value/promotional and capital-intensive reinvestment plans. The ability of franchisees to contribute to the achievement of our plans is dependent in large part on the availability to them of funding at reasonable interest rates and may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in general, by their or our creditworthiness or by banks' lending practices. If our franchisees are unwilling or unable to invest in major initiatives or are unable to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates, or at all, our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nOur operating performance could also be negatively affected if our franchisees experience food safety or other operational problems or project an image inconsistent with our brand and values, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited, costly to exercise or subjected to litigation and potential delays. If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our required standards, our brand's image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.\n\nOur ownership mix also affects our results and financial condition. The decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise or license agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex. The benefits of our more heavily franchised structure depend on various factors including whether we have effectively selected franchisees, licensees and/or affiliates that meet our rigorous standards, whether we are able to successfully integrate them into our structure and whether their performance and the resulting ownership mix supports our brand and financial objectives.",

      "question": "How does the change in the value of anti-dilutive securities excluded from diluted weighted-average common shares between fiscal years 2023 and 2024 at LOW affect the comparison of dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities between LOW and HD in fiscal 2024?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2024, HD reported a constant dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities at 3 million shares across all three fiscal years, with no anti-dilutive securities excluded in 2024. Meanwhile, LOW had 0.1 million anti-dilutive securities excluded in fiscal 2024, down from 0.5 million in fiscal 2023. This reduction in anti-dilutive securities at LOW implies a tighter alignment between basic and diluted shares, contributing to a smaller dilutive effect of 1 million shares in 2024. Therefore, LOW's dilutive effect in 2024 is significantly lower than HD's, which remained steady at 3 million shares.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - HD's effect of potentially dilutive securities is consistently 3 million shares in all fiscal years, with no anti-dilutive securities excluded in 2024.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - LOW's anti-dilutive securities excluded decreased from 0.5 million in 2023 to 0.1 million in 2024, and the dilutive effect of non-participating share-based awards was 1 million shares in 2024.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The reduction in anti-dilutive securities at LOW indicates a smaller pool of shares that could potentially dilute earnings per share, resulting in a smaller dilutive effect (1 million) compared to HD's consistent 3 million dilutive shares in 2024."

The fiscal years ended January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024 had 52 weeks. 1\n\nRepurchases of common stock on a trade-date basis. 2\n\nNet sales for fiscal 2024 decreased 3.1% from fiscal 2023 to $83.7 billion. Comparable sales for fiscal 2024 decreased 2.7%, consisting of a 3.0% decrease in comparable customer transactions, and a 0.3% increase in comparable average ticket. Net earnings for fiscal 2024 decreased 10.0% to $7.0 billion. Diluted earnings per common share decreased 7.4% in fiscal 2024 to $12.23 from $13.20 in fiscal 2023. Included in fiscal 2024 results is pre-tax  income of $177 million associated with the fiscal 2022 sale of the Canadian retail business, which increased diluted earnings per share by $0.24. Included in the fiscal 2023 results is $63 million of pre-tax  income associated with the sale of the Canadian retail business, which increased diluted earnings per share by $0.11 in fiscal year 2023. Adjusting for these items, adjusted diluted earnings per common share decreased 8.4% to $11.99 in 2024 from adjusted diluted earnings per common share of $13.09 in 2023 (see the non-GAAP financial measures discussion).\n\nFor fiscal 2024, cash flows from operating activities were $9.6 billion, with $1.9 billion used for capital ex penditures. Continuing to deliver on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, the Company repurchased $3.9 billion of common stock and paid $2.6 billion in dividends during the year.\n\nMacroeconomic factors, such as ongoing inflation and higher interest rates resulting in depressed levels of housing turnover, continued to exert downward pressure on big-ticket DIY discretionary spending in fiscal 2024. Despite these factors, we generated positive Pro customer comparable sales and increased Pro penetration for the year. This is the result of our cumulative investments in the right brands and products, greater inventory depth, improved job site delivery, dedicated service levels, and the Pro customer digital ex perience. In addition, our strong online performance gives us confidence that our focus on an intuitive user ex perience and omnichannel fulfillment capabilities, specifically more same-day delivery options and an improved Buy Online Pickup in Store experience, are resonating with our customers.",

      "question": "What is the combined percentage of Building Materials sales relative to total sales for both HD and LOW in fiscal 2024, and how does this reflect the importance of the Building Materials category in the Consumer Discretionary sector?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2024, HD reported $12,423 million in Building Materials sales, which accounted for 7.8% of its total net sales of $159,514 million. LOW reported $5,419 million in Building Materials sales, which accounted for 6.5% of its total net sales of $83,674 million. The combined percentage of Building Materials sales relative to total sales for both companies is (12,423 + 5,419) / (159,514 + 83,674) = 17,842 / 243,188 = 7.3%. This reflects that Building Materials remain a significant category within the Consumer Discretionary sector for both major players.",
