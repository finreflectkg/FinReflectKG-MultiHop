      "answer": "Qualcomm faces risks related to intellectual property enforcement that could negatively impact its cash resources due to costly litigation, audits, and potential reductions in royalty revenues. These activities absorb significant financial and management resources, directly affecting its cash flows. In contrast, Cisco strategically uses its strong cash resources for shareholder returns and acquisitions, with $7.7 billion used for stock repurchases and $6.2 billion for dividends in fiscal 2022, along with $0.4 billion for acquisitions. The difference in reported cash outflows between Cisco's strategic uses and Qualcomm's risk-related cash impacts is significant, highlighting divergent financial strategies and exposures.",

These uses of cash were partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of $13.2 billion and issuance of commercial paper of $0.6 billion.\n\nWe  maintain  an  investment  portfolio  of  various  holdings,  types,  and  maturities.  We  classify  our  investments  as  short-term investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio  is  strong,  with  our  cash  equivalents  and  our  available-for-sale  debt  investment  portfolio  consisting  primarily  of  high quality investment-grade securities. We believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies, for acquisitions, for customer financing activities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below.\n\nSecurities Lending We periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our available-for-sale debt investments. These  transactions  are  accounted  for  as  a  secured  lending  of  the  securities,  and  the  securities  are  typically  loaned  only  on  an overnight basis. We require collateral equal to at least 102% of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid, high-quality assets. We engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties, and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses. We did not experience any losses in connection with the secured lending of securities during the periods presented. As of July 30, 2022 and July 31, 2021, we had no outstanding securities lending transactions.\n\nFree Cash Flow and Capital Allocation As part of our capital allocation strategy, we target to return a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually to our stockholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock.\n\nWe define  free  cash  flow  as  net  cash  provided  by  operating  activities  less  cash  used  to  acquire  property  and  equipment.

If any of these risks materialize, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\n\nThe enforcement and protection of our intellectual property may be expensive, could fail to prevent misappropriation or unauthorized use of our intellectual property, could result in the loss of our ability to enforce one or more patents, and could be adversely affected by changes in patent laws, by laws in certain foreign jurisdictions that may not effectively protect our intellectual property and by ineffective enforcement of laws in such jurisdictions.\n\nWe rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements, international treaties and other methods, to protect our intellectual property, including our patent portfolio. Policing unauthorized use of our products, technologies and intellectual property is difficult and time consuming. The steps we have taken have not always prevented, and we cannot be certain the steps we take in the future will prevent, the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our products, technologies or intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our rights as fully or as readily as U.S. laws or where the enforcement of such laws may be lacking or ineffective. See also the Risk Factor titled 'Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches of our IT systems, or other misappropriation of our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information.'\n\nSome industry participants who have a vested interest in devaluing patents in general, or standard-essential patents in particular, have mounted attacks on certain patent systems, increasing the likelihood of changes to established patent laws. We cannot predict with certainty the long-term effects of any potential changes. In the United States, there is continued discussion regarding potential patent law changes, and there is current and potential future litigation regarding patents, the outcomes of which could be detrimental to our licensing business. Further, the laws in certain foreign countries in which our patents are or may be licensed, or our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including certain countries in Asia, may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws in the United States. In addition, we cannot be certain that the laws and policies of any country or the practices of any standards bodies, foreign or domestic, with respect to intellectual property enforcement or licensing or the adoption of standards, will not be changed in the future in ways that are detrimental to our licensing programs or to the sale or use of our products or technologies.\n\nWe have had and may in the future have difficulty in certain circumstances in protecting or enforcing our intellectual property and contracts, including collecting royalties for use of our patent portfolio due to, among others: refusal by certain licensees to report and pay all or a portion of the royalties they owe to us; policies or political actions of governments, including trade protection and national security policies; challenges to our licensing practices under competition laws; adoption of mandatory licensing provisions by foreign jurisdictions; failure of foreign courts to recognize and enforce judgments of contract breach and damages issued by courts in the United States; and challenges before competition agencies to our licensing business or the pricing and integration of additional features and functionality into our chipset products. See also the Risk Factors titled ' Efforts by some original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business ' and ' Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings or other legal proceedings .'\n\nWe have engaged in litigation and arbitration in the past and may need to further litigate or arbitrate in the future to enforce our contract and intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others. As a result of any such litigation or arbitration, we could lose our ability to enforce one or more patents, portions of our license agreements could be determined to be invalid or unenforceable (which may in turn result in other licensees either not complying with their existing license agreements or initiating litigation or arbitration), license terms (including but not limited to royalty rates for the use of our intellectual property) could be imposed that are less favorable to us than existing terms, and we could incur substantial costs. Any action we take to enforce our contract or intellectual property rights could be costly and could absorb significant management time and attention, which, in turn, could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows. Further, even a positive resolution to our enforcement efforts may take time to conclude, which may reduce our revenues and cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development, in the periods prior to conclusion.\n\nAdditionally, although our license agreements generally provide us with the right to audit the books and records of licensees, audits can be expensive, time consuming, incomplete and subject to dispute. Further, certain licensees may not comply with the obligation to provide full access to their books and records. To the extent we do not aggressively enforce our rights under our license agreements, licensees may not comply with their existing license agreements, and to the extent we do not aggressively pursue unlicensed companies to enter into license agreements with us for their use of our intellectual property, other unlicensed companies may not enter into license agreements.\n\nSee also the Risk Factors titled ' Efforts by some original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business ' and 'Our business and",

      "question": "What is the combined increase in Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses between Apple (AAPL) and Qualcomm (QCOM) from fiscal year 2023 to 2024, and how does this compare to the change in their respective total operating expenses over the same period?",
      "answer": "Apple's SG&A expense increased by $1,165 million ($26,097 million in 2024 - $24,932 million in 2023), while Qualcomm's SG&A expense increased by $38 million ($535 million in 2024 - $497 million in 2023). The combined increase in SG&A expenses is $1,203 million. Apple's total operating expenses increased by $2,620 million ($57,467 million in 2024 - $54,847 million in 2023), while Qualcomm's total operating expenses decreased by $35 million ($1,986 million in 2024 - $2,021 million in 2023).

If our brands or reputation  are  damaged,  it  could  negatively  impact  our  revenues  or  margins,  or  ability  to  attract  the  most  highly  qualified employees.\n\nAdverse  economic  or  market  conditions  may  harm  our  business. Worsening  economic  conditions,  including  inflation, recession, pandemic, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adversely affect our revenue. If demand for PCs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected.\n\nOur product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. OEMs building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption.\n\nChallenging  economic  conditions  also  may  impair  the  ability  of  our  customers  to  pay  for  products  and  services  they  have purchased. As a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase.\n\nWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity,  market,  and  interest  rate  risks,  which  may  be  exacerbated  by  market  downturns  or  events  that  affect  global  financial markets. A significant part of our investment portfolio comprises U.S. government securities. If global financial markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced a decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.\n\nCatastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business. A disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyberattack, terrorist attack, pandemic, or other catastrophic event could cause delays  in  completing  sales,  providing  services,  or  performing  other  critical  functions.  Our  corporate  headquarters,  a  significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business operations in the Silicon Valley area of California, both of which are seismically active regions. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems, or the infrastructure or systems they rely on, such as power grids, could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. Providing our customers with  more  services  and  solutions  in  the  cloud  puts  a  premium  on  the  resilience  of  our  systems  and  strength  of  our  business continuity  management  plans  and  magnifies  the  potential  impact  of  prolonged  service  outages  in  our  consolidated  financial statements.\n\nAbrupt  political  change,  terrorist  activity,  and  armed  conflict,  such  as  the  ongoing  conflict  in  Ukraine,  pose  a  risk  of  general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs and negatively impact our ability to sell to and collect from customers in affected markets. These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. Geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory systems and requirements and market interventions that could impact our operating strategies, access to national, regional, and global markets, hiring, and profitability. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some public-sector customers. Any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues.\n\nThe occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic such as COVID-19 may adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has had widespread, rapidly evolving, and unpredictable impacts on global society, economies, financial markets, and business practices. The extent to which global pandemics impact our business going forward will depend on factors such as the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity including the possibility of recession or financial market instability.",

Further, depending on the breadth and severity of the circumstances above, we may have to reduce, suspend or eliminate our capital return programs, and our ability to timely pay our indebtedness may be impacted. These challenges have required, and may in the future require, the investment of significant management time and attention and have resulted, and may in the future result, in significant legal costs.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO INDUSTRY DYNAMICS AND COMPETITION\n\nOur revenues depend on our customers' and licensees' sales of products and services based on CDMA, OFDMA and other communications technologies, including 5G, and customer demand for our products based on these technologies.\n\nWe develop, patent and commercialize technology and products based on CDMA, OFDMA and other communications technologies, which are primarily wireless. We depend on our customers and licensees to develop devices and services based on these technologies to drive consumer demand for new 3G/4G/5G multimode and single-mode devices, and to establish the selling prices for such devices. Further, the timing of our shipments of our products is dependent on the timing of our customers' and licensees' deployments of new devices and services based on these technologies. Increasingly, we also depend on operators of wireless networks, our customers and licensees and other third parties to incorporate these technologies into new device types and into industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, such as automotive and IoT, among others. Commercial deployments of 5G networks and devices have begun and are expected to continue for the foreseeable future. However, the timing and scale of such deployments, in certain regions, have been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and may be further delayed for reasons that are beyond our control.\n\nOur revenues and growth in revenues could be negatively impacted, our business may be harmed and our substantial investments in these technologies may not provide us an adequate return, if: our customers' and licensees' revenues and sales of products, particularly premium-tier products, and services using these technologies, and average selling prices of such products, decline due to, for example, the maturity of smartphone penetration in developed regions, including China; we do not continue to maintain our intellectual property and technical leadership in 5G, including in ongoing 5G standardization efforts; we are unable to drive the adoption of our products into networks and devices, including devices beyond mobile handsets; or consumers' rates of replacement of smartphones and other devices decline.\n\nOur industry is subject to intense competition in an environment of rapid technological change. Our success depends in part on our ability to adapt to such change and compete effectively; and such change and competition could result in decreased demand for our products and technologies or declining average selling prices for our products or those of our customers or licensees.\n\nOur products and technologies face significant competition. Competition may intensify as our current competitors expand their product offerings, improve their products or reduce the prices of their products as part of a strategy to maintain existing business and customers or attract new business and customers, as new opportunities develop, and as new competitors enter the industry. Competition in wireless communications is affected by various factors that include, among others: OEM concentrations; vertical integration; competition in certain geographic regions; government intervention or support of national industries or competitors; the ability to maintain product differentiation in light of evolving industry standards and speed of technological change (including the transition to smaller geometry process technologies and the demand for always on, always connected capabilities); access to capacity in the supply chain; and value-added features that drive selling prices and consumer demand for new 3G/4G/5G multimode and single-mode devices.\n\nWe anticipate that additional competitors will introduce products as a result of growth opportunities in wireless communications, the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors, and technological and public policy changes. Additionally, the semiconductor industry has experienced and may continue to experience consolidation, which could result in significant changes to the competitive landscape. For example, if any key supplier of technologies and intellectual property to the semiconductor industry was sold to one of our competitors, it could negatively affect our ability to procure or license such technologies and intellectual property in the future, at all or upon acceptable terms which could have wide-ranging impacts on our business and operations.\n\nWe expect that our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to:\n\n- differentiate our integrated circuit products with innovative technologies across multiple products and features (e.g., modem, RFFE, including millimeter wave (mmWave), graphics and other processors, camera and connectivity) and with smaller geometry process technologies that drive both performance and lower power consumption;\n- develop and offer integrated circuit products at competitive cost and price points and to effectively cover all geographic regions and all device tiers;\n- continue to be a leader in mobile, and drive the adoption of our technologies and integrated circuit products, including RFFE, into the most popular device models and across a broad spectrum of devices in mobile, such as smartphones, tablets, laptops and other mobile computing devices;\n- increase or accelerate adoption of our technologies and products in industries and applications outside of mobile handsets, including automotive and IoT;",

Based on the specific financial strategies described in both companies' filings, why would a 15% reduction in Qualcomm's licensing revenues from Chinese OEMs not directly impact Microsoft's ability to execute its share repurchase program?",
      "answer": "A 15% reduction in Qualcomm's licensing revenues from Chinese OEMs would directly impact Qualcomm's cash resources available for operations, research and development, and shareholder returns. However, Microsoft's share repurchase program is funded entirely from Microsoft's own cash resources, which are generated independently from Qualcomm's financial performance. Since there is no explicit business relationship stated in the evidence connecting Microsoft's share repurchases to Qualcomm's licensing revenues or cash position, a decline in Qualcomm's cash resources would not directly affect Microsoft's ability to execute its repurchase program.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from MSFT evidence - Microsoft uses its own cash resources to fund share repurchases.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Despite both companies using cash resources for shareholder returns, there is no stated business relationship in the evidence that connects Microsoft's cash position to Qualcomm's licensing revenues. Therefore, a decline in Qualcomm's revenues would not directly impact Microsoft's repurchase program."

Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, while our product and revenue diversification strategies have resulted in an increasing portion of our revenues coming from outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as automotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of customer concentration.\n\nAlthough we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their existing agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the future growth and success of our core licensing business will depend in part on the ability of our licensees to develop, introduce and deliver high-volume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not have control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful. Reductions in sales of our licensees' products, or reductions in the average selling prices of wireless devices sold by our licensees without a sufficient increase in the volumes of such devices sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues.\n\n## Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).\n\nCertain of our largest integrated circuit customers (for example, Samsung) develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, and currently utilize, in certain of their devices and may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products (and they have and may continue to sell their integrated circuit products to third parties, discretely or together with certain of their other products, in competition with us).\n\nApple has utilized modem products of one of our competitors in some of its devices rather than our products, and solely utilized one of our competitors' products in several of its prior device launches. In December 2019, Apple acquired Intel's modem assets and is developing its own modem products using those assets. Accordingly, we expect Apple to use its own modem products, rather than our products, in some or all of its future devices.\n\nSimilarly, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs. Certain of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, including due to pressure from or policies of the Chinese government (whose Made in China 2025 campaign targets 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions. '\n\nIn addition, periodic supply/capacity constraints within the semiconductor industry may further incentivize our integrated circuit customers to vertically integrate in an effort to secure additional control over their supply chains.\n\nIf some or all of our largest customers and/or the largest smartphone OEMs utilize their own integrated circuit/modem products in some or all of their devices rather than our products, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely impacted. See also the Risk Factor titled ' We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices.

      "answer": "$6 (Oracle's 'Other income (expenses), net') + $20 (Texas Instruments' recognized net actuarial loss and settlement losses) = $26. Oracle's figure represents a minor net expense from non-operating activities, while Texas Instruments' figure reflects a specific component of pension-related losses that directly reduced its operating income and other expenses (OI&E). Together, they illustrate different types of non-operating financial impacts affecting corporate earnings.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Oracle's 'Other income (expenses), net' in fiscal year 2023 is $6 million.",

        "Step 4: Synthesize - Both figures represent non-operating financial impacts, with Oracle's being a general net item and Texas Instruments' being specifically tied to pension-related losses affecting OI&E."

How do these changes reflect contrasting cash flow strategies, particularly in terms of capital expenditures and financing activities, based on the detailed disclosures in their respective 10-K filings?",
      "answer": "Oracle's cash flow strategy in fiscal 2024 involved a net increase of $689 million in cash and cash equivalents, driven by $18,673 million in operating cash flow and partially offset by significant capital expenditures of $6,866 million and heavy financing outflows of $10,554 million, primarily from stock repurchases and dividend payments. In contrast, Texas Instruments experienced a net decrease of $86 million in cash and cash equivalents in 2023, with $6,420 million in operating cash flow but substantial capital expenditures of $5,071 million and net financing outflows of $2,144 million, largely due to dividend payments and debt repayments. The difference in strategies is evident: Oracle prioritized shareholder returns through aggressive stock repurchases and dividends, while Texas Instruments focused on maintaining liquidity despite high capital investments, with a more conservative approach to financing activities.",

        "Step 1: From Oracle's 10-K, extract the net increase in cash and cash equivalents ($689 million), operating cash flow ($18,673 million), capital expenditures ($6,866 million), and financing outflows ($10,554 million).",
        "Step 2: From Texas Instruments' 10-K, extract the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents ($86 million), operating cash flow ($6,420 million), capital expenditures ($5,071 million), and financing outflows ($2,144 million).",
        "Step 3: Compare the magnitude and composition of operating, investing, and financing cash flows between the two companies to identify contrasting strategies, particularly around capital allocation and liquidity management."

      "answer": "The combined change in 'Cash and Cash Equivalents at End of Period' for Oracle and Texas Instruments from fiscal year 2022 to 2023 is a decrease of $1,224 million. Oracle's cash and equivalents increased from $21,383 million to $9,765 million (a decrease of $11,618 million), while Texas Instruments' cash and equivalents decreased from $4,631 million to $3,050 million (a decrease of $1,581 million). Oracle's operating cash flow increased from $9,539 million in 2022 to $17,165 million in 2023, which helped offset some of the cash outflows from investing and financing activities. In contrast, Texas Instruments' operating cash flow decreased from $8,756 million in 2022 to $6,420 million in 2023, contributing to its overall cash decline.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Oracle's 'Cash and cash equivalents at end of period' decreased from $21,383 million in 2022 to $9,765 million in 2023, a change of -$11,618 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Texas Instruments' 'Cash and cash equivalents at end of period' decreased from $4,631 million in 2021 to $3,050 million in 2022, a change of -$1,581 million.",
        "Step 3: Calculate combined change - Oracle's -$11,618 million + Texas Instruments' -$1,581 million = -$13,199 million total decrease.",
        "Step 4: Analyze operating cash flow trends - Oracle's operating cash flow increased from $9,539 million to $17,165 million, while Texas Instruments' operating cash flow decreased from $8,756 million to $6,420 million.",
        "Step 5: Synthesize - The combined cash position of both companies declined significantly, but Oracle's strong operating cash flow growth contrasted with Texas Instruments' decline, indicating differing internal cash generation capabilities that influenced their overall liquidity positions."

      "answer": "Adobe faces exposure from changes in tax regulations, particularly due to the U.S. Tax Act requiring capitalization and amortization of R&D costs, which adversely affects its effective tax rate. This is partially offset by benefits from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. Additionally, Adobe maintains a $405 million valuation allowance against certain state credits, indicating significant exposure to tax rule changes. Oracle also faces adverse impacts on its effective tax rates from unfavorable shifts in earnings toward jurisdictions with higher tax rates or unfavorable changes in tax laws. Unlike Adobe, Oracle emphasizes its earnings mix across jurisdictions as a primary determinant of tax rate volatility. Both companies are exposed to regulatory changes, but Adobe's exposure is more specifically tied to U.S. tax provisions and valuation allowances, while Oracle's is more jurisdictional earnings-dependent.",

Ongoing business may be disrupted, and our management's attention may be diverted by acquisition, investment, transition or integration activities. In addition, we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources, and our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and assimilate and retain employees of those businesses into our culture and operations. The loss of key executives, employees, customers, suppliers, vendors and other business partners of businesses we acquire may adversely impact the value of the assets, operations or businesses. Furthermore, acquisitions or joint ventures may result in significant costs and expenses, including those related to retention payments, equity compensation, severance pay, early retirement costs, intangible asset amortization and asset impairment charges, enhancing controls, procedures and policies including those related to financial reporting, disclosure, and cyber and information security, assumed litigation and other liabilities, and legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, which could negatively affect our profitability as these costs and expenses grow along with the increased capital invested in such acquisitions and joint ventures. We may have difficulties as a result of entering into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions.\n\nWe might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition, investment or joint venture we undertake. We might not achieve our expected return on investment or may lose money. We may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume from a company we acquire or in which we invest, including from that company's known and unknown obligations, intellectual property or other assets, terminated employees, current or former clients or other third parties. In addition, we may fail to identify or adequately assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring, investing in or partnering with a company, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions or liabilities resulting from an acquisition target's previous activities, or from an acquisition's controls related to financial reporting, disclosure, and cyber and information security environment. The number of transactions we execute annually may increase this risk. If any of these circumstances occurs, they could result in unexpected regulatory or legal exposure, including litigation with new or existing clients, unfavorable accounting treatment, unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our relationships with clients and our business. In addition, we have a lesser degree of control over the business operations of the joint ventures and businesses in which we have made minority investments or in which we have acquired less than 100% of the equity. This lesser degree of control may expose us to additional reputational, financial, legal, compliance or operational risks. Litigation, indemnification claims and other unforeseen claims and liabilities may arise from the acquisition or operation of acquired businesses. For example, we may face litigation or other claims as a result of certain terms and conditions of the acquisition agreement, such as earnout payments or closing working capital adjustments. Alternatively, shareholder litigation may arise as a result of proposed acquisitions. If we are unable to complete the number and kind of investments for which we plan, or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating acquired businesses into our operations, we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share, profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services.\n\nWe also periodically evaluate, and have engaged in, the disposition of assets and businesses. Divestitures could involve difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and people, the diversion of management's attention, the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees. After reaching an agreement with a buyer for the disposition of a business, the transaction may be subject to the satisfaction of pre-closing conditions, including obtaining necessary regulatory and government approvals, which, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the transaction. Divestitures may also involve continued financial involvement in or liability with respect to the divested assets and businesses, such as indemnities or other financial obligations, in which the performance of the divested assets or businesses could impact our results of operations. Any divestiture we undertake could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Risks\n\n## Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability.\n\nWe are subject to, and may become a party to, a variety of litigation or other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving current and former employees, clients, ecosystem partners, subcontractors, suppliers, competitors, shareholders, government agencies or others through private actions, class actions, whistleblower claims, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. Regardless of the merits of the claims, the cost to defend current and future litigation may be significant, and such matters can be time-consuming and divert management's attention and resources. The results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in materially adverse monetary damages, fines, penalties, debarment or injunctive relief against us. Any claims or litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future.\n\nWe could be subject to significant legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, contribute to internal control or other deficiencies of a client or otherwise breach obligations to third parties, including clients, ecosystem",

          "chunk_text": "- our IP rights will provide competitive advantages to us;\n- rights previously granted by third parties to IP licensed or assigned to us, including portfolio cross-licenses, will not hamper our ability to assert our IP rights or hinder the settlement of currently pending or future disputes;\n- any of our pending or future patent, trademark or copyright applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought;\n- our IP rights will be enforced in certain jurisdictions where competition is intense or where legal protection may be weak; or\n- we have sufficient IP rights to protect our products or our business.\n\nEffective IP protection may be unavailable or more limited in other jurisdictions, relative to those protections available in the U.S., and may not be applied for or may be abandoned in one or more relevant jurisdictions. In addition, when patents expire, we lose the protection and competitive advantages they provided to us.\n\nWe also generate revenue from licensing royalty payments and from technology claim settlements relating to certain of our IP. Licensing of our IP rights, particularly exclusive licenses, may limit our ability to assert those IP rights against third parties, including the licensee of those rights. In addition, we may acquire companies with IP that is subject to licensing obligations to other third parties. These licensing obligations may extend to our own IP following any such acquisition and may limit our ability to assert our IP rights. From time to time, we pursue litigation to assert our IP rights, including, in some cases, against our customers and suppliers. Claims of this sort could also harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us. Conversely, third parties have and may in the future pursue IP litigation against us, including as a result of our IP licensing business. An adverse decision in such types of legal action could limit our ability to assert our IP rights and limit the value of our technology, including the loss of opportunities to sell or license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments, which could otherwise negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nFrom time to time, we may need to obtain additional IP licenses or renew existing license agreements. We are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms or at all.\n\nIf our software products do not remain compatible with ever-changing operating environments, platforms, or third-party products, demand for our products and services could decrease, which could materially adversely affect our business.\n\nWe may be required to make substantial modification of our products to maintain compatibility with operating systems, systems software and computer hardware used by our customers or to provide our customers with desired features or capabilities. We must also continually address the challenges of dynamic and accelerating market trends and competitive developments, such as the emergence of advanced persistent threats in the security space to compete effectively. There can be no assurance that we will be able to adapt our products in response to these developments.\n\nFurther, our software solutions interact with a variety of software and hardware developed by third parties. If we lose access to third-party code and specifications for the development of code, this could negatively impact our ability to develop compatible software. In addition, if software providers and hardware manufacturers, including some of our largest vendors, adopt new policies restricting the use or availability of their code or technical documentation for their operating systems, applications, or hardware, or otherwise impose unfavorable terms and conditions for such access, this could result in higher research and development costs for the enhancement and modification of our existing products or development of new products. Any additional restrictions could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results and cash flow.\n\n## Failure to enter into software license agreements on a satisfactory basis could materially adversely affect our business.\n\nMany of our existing customers have multi-year enterprise software license agreements, some of which involve substantial aggregate fee amounts. Customer renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the level of customer satisfaction with our solutions or customer support, customer budgets and the pricing of our solutions as compared with the solutions offered by our competitors, any of which may cause our revenue to grow more slowly than expected, if at all. The failure to renew customer agreements of similar scope, on terms that are commercially attractive to us, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results and cash flow.\n\nCertain software that we use in our products is licensed from third parties and may not be available to us in the future, which may delay product development and production or cause us to incur additional expense.\n\nSome of our solutions contain software licensed from third parties, some of which may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable to us or allow our products to remain competitive.

Given both companies operate in the same sector and face uncertainties in tax estimates, how does the combination of high debt and unresolved tax liabilities affect their respective financial flexibility, and what specific disclosures indicate their vulnerability to cash flow disruptions?",
      "answer": "ACN discloses that final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities could materially differ from estimates, potentially impacting cash flows in the period of resolution. AVGO, with $41,218 million in senior notes, faces similar tax audit risks and notes that adjustments could adversely affect its results of operations and cash flows. Both companies operate in the Information Technology sector and face uncertainties in tax estimates, but AVGO\u2019s substantial indebtedness increases its vulnerability to cash flow disruptions if tax liabilities exceed provisions. ACN does not disclose a specific debt figure but highlights the potential material effect on cash flows, whereas AVGO explicitly ties its debt obligations to restricted financial flexibility, making the impact of tax uncertainties more pronounced for AVGO due to its leveraged position.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies face tax estimate uncertainties, but AVGO\u2019s high debt load makes it more vulnerable to cash flow disruptions from adverse tax outcomes, as its financial flexibility is already constrained by debt obligations."

          "chunk_text": "As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes. We establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged. In evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We evaluate tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax positions are reasonable. However, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for these positions.\n\n## Revenues by Segment/Geographic Market\n\nOur three reportable operating segments are our geographic markets, North America, Europe and Growth Markets. In addition to reporting revenues by geographic market and industry group, we also report revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our geographic markets. Consulting revenues, which include strategy, management and technology consulting and technology integration consulting, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables. Outsourcing revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions.\n\nFrom time to time, our geographic markets work together to sell and implement certain contracts. The resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating geographic markets. Generally, operating expenses for each geographic market have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our geographic markets affect revenues and operating expenses within our geographic markets to differing degrees. The mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our geographic markets. Local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our geographic markets differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses.\n\nWhile we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume. Management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume. Instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements. Revenue for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and the outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors.",

Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there is no assurance that the final determination of our income tax liability will not be materially different than what is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals.\n\nOur income taxes are subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by numerous factors including:\n\n- reorganization or restructuring of our businesses, tangible and intangible assets, outstanding indebtedness and corporate structure;\n- jurisdictional mix of our income and assets;\n- changes in the allocation of income and expenses, including adjustments related to changes in our corporate structure, acquisitions or tax law;\n- changes in U.S and foreign tax laws and regulations, changes to the taxation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries, taxation of U.S. income generated from foreign sources, the deductibility of expenses attributable to income and foreign tax credit rules;\n- tax effects of increases in non-deductible employee compensation; and\n- changes in tax accounting rules or principles and in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\nWe have adopted transfer pricing policies that call for the provision of services, the sale of products, the arrangement of financing and the grant of licenses from one affiliate to another at prices that we believe are negotiated on an arm's length basis. Our taxable income is dependent upon acceptance by local authorities that our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing are on an arm's length basis. Due to inconsistencies in application of the arm's length standard among taxing authorities, as well as lack of comprehensive treaty-based protection, transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could, if successful, result in adjustments for prior or future years. The effects of any such changes could subject us to higher taxes and our earnings, results of operations and cash flow would be adversely affected.\n\nIn addition, we are subject to, and are under, tax audit in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us. Although we believe our tax positions are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our income tax provisions and accruals. The ultimate result of an audit could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Indebtedness\n\n## Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to execute our business strategy.\n\nAs of October 30, 2022, the aggregate indebtedness under our senior notes was $41,218 million. This amount does not reflect any debt we expect to incur or assume in connection with the VMware Merger.\n\nOur substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including:\n\n- increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions;\n- exposing us to interest rate risk due to our variable rate term facilities, which we do not typically hedge against;\n- limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the economy and the semiconductor industry;\n- placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness;\n- making it more difficult to borrow additional funds in the future to fund growth, acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures and other purposes; and\n- potentially requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund our other business needs.\n\nWe receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the U.S. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, reserve mix and commodity pricing levels could also be considered by the rating agencies. While we are focused on maintaining investment grade ratings from these agencies, we may be unable to do so. Any downgrade in our credit rating or the ratings of our indebtedness, or adverse conditions in the debt capital markets, could:\n\n- adversely affect the trading price of, or market for, our debt securities;\n- increase interest expense under our term facilities;\n- increase the cost of, and adversely affect our ability to refinance, our existing debt; and\n- adversely affect our ability to raise additional debt.",

          "chunk_text": "## Xilinx Acquisition Litigation\n\nOn October 26, 2020, the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiary, Thrones Merger Sub, Inc., and Xilinx, Inc. ('Xilinx') entered a definitive agreement (the 'Merger Agreement') in which the Company will acquire Xilinx by merging Thrones Merger Sub, Inc. with and into Xilinx, with Xilinx continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the 'Proposed Transaction'). See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. On December 3, 2020, the Company and Xilinx filed a Registration Statement on Form S-4 (together with the joint proxy statement and prospectus contained therein, the 'Registration Statement') describing the Proposed Transaction and other related matters. On December 11, 2020, a Xilinx shareholder filed a putative class action in the New York State Supreme Court, New York County, regarding the Proposed Transaction. Nunez v. Xilinx, Case No. 656971/2020 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.) ('Nunez'). The lawsuit alleges that the Board of Directors of Xilinx breached their fiduciary duties to Xilinx shareholders in connection with the Proposed Transaction by allegedly failing to obtain fair, adequate and maximum consideration for Xilinx shareholders in connection with the Proposed Transaction and by not disclosing certain material information about the Proposed Transaction in the Registration Statement. The lawsuit asserts  a  single  claim  against  the  Company,  alleging  that  it  aided  and  abetted  the  Xilinx  directors'  breach  of  their fiduciary duties. The lawsuit seeks to enjoin or rescind any transaction with Xilinx as well as certain other equitable relief, unspecified damages and attorneys' fees and costs.\n\nOn December 15, 2020, a Xilinx shareholder filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of  New  York,  regarding  the  Proposed  Transaction.  Shumacher  v.  Xilinx,  Case  No.  1:20-cv-10595  (S.D.N.Y.) ('Shumacher').  The  lawsuit  alleges  that  Xilinx  and  its  Board  of  Directors  disseminated  a  false  and  misleading Registration Statement that omitted material information regarding the Proposed Transaction, thereby violating Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 'Exchange Act'). The lawsuit also asserts a single claim against the Company, alleging that it acted as a controlling person of Xilinx within the meaning of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act by virtue of its supervisory control over the composition of the Registration Statement. The lawsuit seeks to  enjoin  or  rescind  any  transaction  with  Xilinx  as  well  as  certain  other  equitable  relief,  unspecified  damages  and attorneys' fees and costs.\n\nOn  December  23,  2020,  a  shareholder  of  the  Company  filed  a  lawsuit  in  the  United  States  District  Court  of  the Southern District of New York regarding the Proposed Transaction. Vazirani v. Advanced Micro Devices, Case No. 1:20cv-10894 (S.D.N.Y) ('Vazirani'). The lawsuit alleges that the Company and its Board of Directors disseminated a false and misleading Registration Statement that omitted material information regarding the Proposed Transaction, thereby violating  Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The lawsuit seeks to enjoin or rescind any transaction with Xilinx as well as certain other equitable relief, unspecified damages and attorneys' fees and costs.\n\nOn March 22, 2021, the Nunez complaint was voluntarily dismissed, and on March 25, 2021, the Vazirani complaint was voluntarily dismissed. The Shumacher complaint was voluntarily dismissed on April 9, 2021.\n\n## Future Link Systems Litigation\n\nOn December 21, 2020, Future Link Systems, LLC filed a patent infringement complaint against the Company in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. Future Link Systems alleges that the Company infringes three  U.S.  patents:  7,983,888  (related  to  simulated  PCI  express  circuitry);  6,363,466  (related  to  out  of  order  data transactions);  and  6,622,108  (related  to  interconnect  testing).  Future  Link  Systems  seeks  unspecified  monetary damages, enhanced damages, interest, fees, expenses, costs, and injunctive relief against the Company. On March 22, 2021, the Company filed its answer to Future Link Systems' complaint and also filed counterclaims based on Future Link Systems' breach of the parties' pre-suit non-disclosure agreement. On April 12, 2021, Future Link Systems filed its answer to the Company's counterclaims. On June 3, 2021, the Company filed a motion to transfer the case to Austin, Texas. On October 14, 2021, the Court issued an order construing certain terms in the asserted patents. On November 22, 2021, the case was reassigned to the Austin division. On January 5, 2022, the Company filed a motion to strike Future Link System's infringement contentions, and Future Link Systems filed a response on January 19, 2022. On January 14, 2022, the USPTO instituted an IPR trial for one of the three patents in suit.\n\nOn December 21, 2021, Future Link Systems LLC filed a lawsuit alleging infringement of two patents related to power management. The Company was served with the complaint on December 28, 2021. On December 28, 2021, Future Link Systems LLC filed a complaint at the United States International Trade Commission alleging infringement of the same two power management patents. Several of the Company's customers were also named as respondents. On January 26, 2022, the USITC announced that it would institute the investigation.",

We completed the Registered Exchange Offer on August 10, 2020. Substantially all of our 2020 Senior Notes and April 2019 Senior Notes were tendered and exchanged for the corresponding Registered Notes in the Registered Exchange Offer.\n\n## Commercial Paper\n\nIn February 2019, we established a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes ('Commercial Paper') in principal amount of up to $2 billion outstanding at any time with maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issue. Commercial Paper is sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and may be issued at a discount from par or, alternatively, may be sold at par and bear interest at rates dictated by market conditions at the time of their issuance. The discount associated with the Commercial Paper is amortized to interest expense over its term. Outstanding Commercial Paper reduces the amount that would otherwise be available to borrow for general corporate purposes under our revolving credit facility.

      "answer": "AMD anticipates ongoing and increasing costs related to enhancing information security controls, upgrading security components, training workers, responding to breaches, and complying with external regulations. These cybersecurity-related expenses could directly reduce gross margins if not offset by revenue growth. Similarly, AVGO purchases approximately two-thirds of its manufacturing materials from five providers, some of which are single-source suppliers. Disruptions or price increases from these suppliers\u2014due to capacity constraints, inflation, or geopolitical factors\u2014could increase manufacturing costs and limit production, which would also negatively impact gross margins.

Our efforts to prevent and address security vulnerabilities may decrease performance, be only partially effective or not successful at all. We may depend on vendors to create mitigations to their technology that we incorporate into our products and they may delay or decline to make such mitigations. We may also depend on third parties, such as customers and end users, to  deploy  our  mitigations  alone  or  as  part  of  their  own  mitigations,  and  they  may  delay, decline  or  modify  the  implementation  of  such  mitigations.  Our  relationships  with  our  customers  could  be  adversely affected  as  some  of  our  customers  may  stop  purchasing  our  products,  reduce  or  delay  future  purchases  of  our products, or use competing products. Any of these actions by our customers could adversely affect our revenue. We have and may in the future be subject to claims and litigation related to security vulnerabilities. Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities of our products may subject us to adverse publicity, damage to our brand and reputation, and could materially harm our business or financial results.\n\n## IT  outages, data loss, data breaches and cyber-attacks could compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive  information,  be  costly  to  remediate  or  cause  significant  damage  to  our  business,  reputation  and operations.\n\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we maintain sensitive data on our information technology (IT) assets, and also may  maintain  sensitive  information  on  our  business  partners'  and  third-party  providers'  IT  assets,  including  our intellectual  property  and  proprietary  or  confidential  business  information  relating  to  our  business  and  that  of  our customers and business partners. The White House, SEC and other regulators have also increased their focus on companies'  cybersecurity  vulnerabilities  and  risks.  Maintaining  the  security  of  this  information  is  important  to  our business  and  reputation.  We  believe  that  companies  like AMD  have  been  increasingly  subject  to  a  wide  variety  of security  incidents,  cyber-attacks,  hacking  and  phishing  attacks,  business  and  system  disruption  attacks,  and  other attempts to gain unauthorized access. The increased prevalence of work-from-home arrangements at AMD and our providers  has  presented  additional  operational  and  cybersecurity  risks  to  our  IT  systems  as  well  as  those  of  our customers, business partners, and third-party partners. These threats can come from a variety of sources, all ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker or insider threat to a state-sponsored attack. Cyber threats may be generic, or they  may  be  custom-crafted  against  our  information  systems.  Cyber  threats  may  come  into  our  network  through malicious code that is added to widely available open-source software. Cyber-attacks have become increasingly more prevalent and much harder to detect, defend against or prevent. Our network and storage applications, as well as those of our customers, business partners, and third-party providers, have been and may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions.\n\nIt is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused by such incidents. It also may not be possible to determine the root cause of such incidents. These data breaches and any unauthorized access, misuse or disclosure of our information or intellectual property could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information. Cyber-attacks on us or our customers, business partners or third-party providers could also  cause  us  to  incur  significant  remediation  costs,  result  in  product  development  delays,  disrupt  key  business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. These incidents could also subject us to liability, expose us to significant expense and cause significant harm to our reputation and business.\n\nWe  also  maintain  confidential  and  personally  identifiable  information  about  our  workers  and  consumers.  The confidentiality  and  integrity  of  our  worker  and  consumer  data  is  important  to  our  business  and  our  workers  and consumers  have  a  high  expectation  that  we  adequately  protect  their  personal  information.  In  addition,  many governments  have  enacted  laws  around  personally  identifiable  information,  such  as  the  European  Union's  General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, and failure to comply could result in sanctions or other actions by the governments.\n\nWe  anticipate  ongoing  and  increasing  costs  related  to:  enhancing  and  implementing  information  security  controls, including  costs  related  to  upgrading  application,  computer,  and  network  security  components;  training  workers  to maintain and monitor our security controls; investigating, responding to and remediating any data security breach, and addressing any related litigation; mitigating reputational harm; and complying with external regulations.",

This could also result in litigation for alleged failure to meet our obligations, payment of significant damages, and our net revenue could decline, adversely affecting our business, financial condition, results of operations and gross margin.\n\nFurther, any substantial disruption in the contract manufacturing services that we utilize, including TSMC's supply of wafers to us, as a result of a natural disaster, climate change, water shortages, political unrest, military conflicts, geopolitical turmoil, trade tensions, government orders, medical epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, economic instability, equipment failure or other cause, could materially harm our business, customer relationships and results of operations.\n\n## We purchase a significant amount of the materials used in our products from a limited number of suppliers.\n\nOur manufacturing processes and those of our CMs rely on many materials, including silicon, GaAs and InP wafers, copper lead frames, precious and rare earth metals, mold compound, ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases. During fiscal year 2022, we purchased approximately two-thirds of our manufacturing materials from five materials providers, some of which are single source suppliers. As certain materials are highly specialized, the lead time needed to identify and qualify a new supplier is typically lengthy and there is often no readily available alternative source. We do not generally have long-term contracts with our materials providers and substantially all of our purchases are on a purchase order basis. Suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies, place products on allocation or increase prices due to commodity price increases, capacity constraints, inflation, or other factors, any of which could lead to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry. For example, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced some supply constraints and increases in prices, including with respect to wafers and substrates. Additionally, the supply of these materials may be negatively impacted by increased trade tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners, particularly China. The supply constraints have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our customer relationships. Further, continued supply constraints for these or any other reasons could result in loss of revenue opportunities and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nOur business is subject to various governmental regulations, and compliance with these regulations may cause us to incur significant expense. If we fail to maintain compliance with applicable regulations, we may be forced to cease the manufacture and distribution of certain products, and we could be subject to administrative proceedings and civil or criminal penalties.\n\nOur business is subject to various domestic and international laws and other legal requirements, including anticompetition and import/export regulations, such as the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, and applicable executive orders. These laws, regulations and orders are complex, may change frequently and with limited notice, and have generally and may continue to become more stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant expense to comply with, or to remedy violations of, these regulations. In addition, if our customers fail to comply with these regulations, we may be required to suspend sales to these customers, which could damage our reputation and negatively impact our results of operations. The U.S. government may also add companies to its restricted entity list and/or technologies to its list of prohibited exports to specific countries, which have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our products and our revenue. For example, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., one of our customers, is subject to certain U.S. export restrictions, which has required us to suspend sales to Huawei until we obtain licenses from the U.S. Department of Commerce. We may be unable to obtain or maintain the necessary licenses to allow us to export products to them. These restrictive governmental actions and any similar measures that may be imposed on U.S. companies by other governments, especially in light of ongoing trade tensions with China, will likely limit or prevent us from doing business with certain of our customers or suppliers and harm our ability to compete effectively or otherwise negatively affect our ability to sell our products, and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\nOur products and operations are also subject to regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory agencies, such as the FTC. From time to time, we may also be involved or required to participate in regulatory investigations or inquiries, such as the ongoing investigation by the Korean Fair Trade Commission into certain of our contracting and business practices, which may evolve into legal or other administrative proceedings. Growing public concern over concentration of economic power in corporations is likely to result in increased anti-competition legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, and enforcement activity. Involvement in regulatory investigations or inquiries, can be costly, lengthy, complex and time consuming, diverting the attention and energies of our management and technical personnel.",

      "answer": "AMD faces operational risks such as natural disasters, political instability, and supply chain disruptions, which can lead to production delays, increased costs, and interruptions in business operations. These risks could directly impact its ability to meet product demand and maintain stable revenue. Meanwhile, AVGO's reliance on a small number of distributors for the majority of its revenue (56% in fiscal 2022) exposes it to customer concentration risk and fluctuations in demand based on distributor inventory levels and end-user demand. If either company experiences disruptions\u2014AMD in production or AVGO in distribution\u2014their respective revenue streams could become volatile.

For example, our Santa Clara operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. Also, we have operations and employees in regions that have experienced prolonged heat waves and freezing in Texas and wildfires in California. Extreme weather events can also disrupt the ability of our suppliers to deliver expected manufacturing parts and/or services for periods of time.  There  may  be  conflict  or  uncertainty  in  the  countries  in  which  we  operate,  including  public  health  issues  (for example, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as COVID-19, avian influenza, measles or Ebola), safety issues, natural disasters, fire, disruptions of service from utilities, nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors. For example, governments worldwide have implemented, and continue to implement, measures to slow down the outbreak of COVID-19. We have experienced, and will continue to experience, disruptions to our business as these measures  have,  and  will  continue  to  have,  an  effect  on  our  business  operations  and  practices.  In  addition,  many governments have enacted laws around personally identifiable information, such as the European Union's general Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, and the failure to comply could result in sanctions or other  actions  by  the  governments.  The  European  Union's  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  imposes  significant requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for non-compliance. Any of the above risks, should they occur, could result in an increase in the cost of components, production delays, general business interruptions,  delays  from  difficulties  in  obtaining  export  licenses  for  certain  technology,  tariffs  and other barriers and restrictions, longer payment cycles, increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n## We may incur future impairments of goodwill and technology license purchases.\n\nWe perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year. Subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management's business strategy, an inability to successfully  introduce  new  products  in  the  marketplace,  an  inability  to  successfully  achieve  internal  forecasts  or significant declines in our stock price, which may represent an indicator of impairment.

In addition, disruptions to commercial transportation infrastructure impacted delivery times for materials and components to our facilities, transfers of our products to our key suppliers and, in some cases, our ability to timely ship our products to customers. This resulted in significant logistical challenges and product delays, which could recur in the event of any future closures of, or periods of reduced operations at, our warehouse or the facilities of our suppliers and providers.\n\nIn response to the pandemic, we have taken extensive measures to protect the health and safety of our employees and contractors at our facilities. However, existing or new precautionary measures or modifications in our business practices and policies, may negatively impact our business or operations, especially if the spread of COVID-19 (including any variants) worsens significantly. In addition, any actions we take may not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of infection and could result in a significant number of COVID-19-related claims. If a significant number of our employees, or employees and third parties performing key functions, including our Chief Executive Officer and members of our Board of Directors, become ill, our business may be further adversely impacted. In addition, changes to state workers' compensation laws, such as those in California, may increase our potential liability for such claims.

Sales to distributors accounted for 56% of our net revenue in the fiscal year ended October 30, 2022 and are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\n- fluctuations in demand based on our distributors' product inventory levels and end customer demand;\n- our distributors and other channel partners are generally not subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our products to their customers;\n- our distributors and other channel partners agreements are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated at any time without cause;\n- our lack of control over the timing of delivery of our products to end customers; and\n- our distributors and other channel partners may market and distribute competing products and may place greater emphasis on the sale of these products.\n\nIn addition, we are selling our semiconductor products through an increasingly limited number of distributors, which exposes us to additional customer concentration and related credit risks.\n\nWe do not always have a direct relationship with the end customers of our products. As a result, our semiconductor products may be used in applications for which they were not necessarily designed or tested, including, for example, medical devices, and they may not perform as anticipated in such applications. In such event, failure of even a small number of parts could result in significant liabilities to us, damage our reputation and harm our business and results of operations.\n\n## Our business would be adversely affected by the departure of existing members of our senior management team.\n\nOur success depends, in large part, on the continued contributions of our senior management team, and in particular, the services of Hock E. Tan, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Effective succession planning is also important for our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfers of knowledge and smooth transitions involving senior management could hinder our strategic planning and execution. None of our senior management is bound by written employment contracts. In addition, we do not currently maintain key person life insurance covering our senior management. The loss of any of our senior management could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate.\n\n## If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, especially our engineering and technical personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively.\n\nOur future success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.

Failure to adequately maintain and update our security systems could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain worker confidence. Failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information, IT outages, data loss and data breaches could materially adversely affect our financial condition, our competitive position and operating results.\n\n## Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe  typically  sell  our  products  pursuant  to  individual  purchase  orders.  We  generally  do  not  have  long-term  supply arrangements  with  our  customers  or  minimum  purchase  requirements  except  that  orders  generally  must  be  for standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inventory levels in part on customers' estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our products are  sold  indirectly  through  downstream  channel  distributors  and  customers,  as  our  forecasts  for  demand  are  then based  on  estimates  provided  by  multiple  parties  throughout  the  downstream  channel.  For  instance,  we  have experienced and continue to experience increased demand for our products. To the extent we fail to forecast demand and product mix accurately or are unable to increase production or secure sufficient capacity and there is a mismatch between supply and demand for our products, it could limit our ability to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of our markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for  any  reason.  We  may  build  inventories  during  periods  of  anticipated  growth,  and  the  cancellation  or  deferral  of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins. Our customers may also experience a shortage of, or delay in receiving, certain components to build their products, which in turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our products. For instance, our OEMs have and continue to experience industry-wide challenges securing matched component sets to build their products.\n\nFactors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of the value of our inventory, a reduction in the average selling price or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions.\n\n## Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property.\n\nIn  the  design  and  development  of  new  and  enhanced  products,  we  rely  on  third-party  intellectual  property  such  as development and testing tools for software and hardware. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties. The design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and  greater  functionality  from  semiconductor  products  may  exceed  the  capabilities  of  the  third-party  intellectual property or development or testing tools available to us.

We use these internal fabrication facilities for products utilizing our innovative and proprietary processes. Our Fort Collins and Breinigsville facilities are the sole sources for the FBAR components used in many of our wireless devices and for the indium phosphide-based wafers used in our fibre optics products, respectively. Many of our facilities, and those of our CMs and suppliers, are located in California and the Pacific Rim region, which have above average seismic activity and severe weather activity. In addition, a significant majority of our research and development personnel are located the Czech Republic, India, Israel and the U.S., with the expertise of the personnel at each such location tending to be focused on one or two specific areas, and our primary warehouse is in Malaysia.\n\nA prolonged disruption at or shut-down of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or warehouses, especially our Colorado, Singapore, Malaysia and Pennsylvania facilities, or those of our CMs or suppliers, due to natural- or manmade disasters or other events outside of our control, such as equipment malfunction or widespread outbreaks of acute illness, including COVID-19, or for any other reason, would limit our capacity to meet customer demands and delay new product development until a replacement facility and equipment, if necessary, were found. To date, we have not experienced a material event, however such event could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue, result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand, expose us to claims by our customers, result in significant expense to repair or replace our affected facilities, and, in some instances, could significantly curtail our research and development efforts in a particular product area or target market. As a result, we could forgo revenue opportunities, potentially lose market share, damage our customer relationships and be subject to litigation and additional liabilities, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business. Although we purchase insurance to mitigate certain losses, such insurance often carries a high deductible amount and any uninsured losses could negatively affect our operating results. In addition, even if we were able to promptly resume production of our affected products, if our customers cannot timely resume their own manufacturing following such an event, they may cancel or scale back their orders from us and this may in turn adversely affect our results of operations. Such events could also result in increased fixed costs relative to the revenue we generate and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\n## We may be unable to maintain appropriate manufacturing capacity or product yields at our own manufacturing facilities, which could adversely affect our relationships with our customers, and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe must maintain appropriate capacity and product yields at our own manufacturing facilities to meet anticipated customer demand. From time to time, this requires us to invest in expansion or improvements of those facilities, which often involves substantial cost and other risks. Such expanded manufacturing capacity may still be insufficient, or may not come online soon enough, to meet customer demand and we may have to put customers on product allocation, forgo sales or lose customers as a result. Conversely, if we overestimate customer demand, we would experience excess capacity and fixed costs at these facilities will not be fully absorbed, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations. Similarly, reduced product yields, due to design or manufacturing issues or otherwise, may involve significant time and cost to remedy and cause delays in our ability to supply product to our customers, all of which could cause us to forgo sales, incur liabilities or lose customers, and harm our results of operations.\n\n## An impairment of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our IT systems, or those of one or more of our corporate infrastructure vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nOur business depends on various internally managed IT systems and outsourced IT services, including cloudbased and other critical corporate infrastructure services relating to, among other things, financial reporting, product orders and shipping, human resources, benefit plan administration, IT network development, network monitoring and electronic communication services, as well as third-party data centers. Any failure of these internal or third-party systems and services to operate effectively could disrupt our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our IT infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect. Although these systems are designed to protect and secure our customers', suppliers' and employees' confidential information, as well as our own proprietary information, we are, out of necessity, dependent on our vendors to adequately address cyber security threats to their own systems. In addition, software products we use (including technologies produced by us) have occasionally had in the past and may have in the future, vulnerabilities that, if left unmanaged, could reduce the overall level of security of the systems on which the software is installed.",

Texas Instruments emphasizes a stronger shift toward direct customer relationships, with about two-thirds of its revenue coming directly from customers in 2021. TI also notes that transactions on TI.com grew to about 10% of its revenue, and the company has invested in e-commerce enhancements, localized online experiences, and inventory consignment programs. Oracle benefits from direct sales through variable compensation tied to performance, while TI gains broader market reach, better customer insight, and a structural cost advantage through its direct engagement strategy.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From Oracle's 10-K, we learn that the company uses a direct sales force alongside indirect channels for hardware sales and that sales and marketing expenses are largely personnel-related, including variable compensation tied to hardware sales.",
        "Step 2: From Texas Instruments' 10-K, we see that approximately two-thirds of its revenue in 2021 came directly from customers, with TI.com transactions growing to 10% of revenue. TI has invested in direct customer capabilities such as localized e-commerce and inventory consignment programs.",
        "Step 3: Synthesizing both, we compare Oracle's personnel-driven, variable-compensation-based direct sales model with TI's broader strategic investment in digital and relationship-based direct engagement, which also yields operational benefits like supply chain control and cost advantages."

The  hardware  product  and  related  software,  such  as  an  operating  system  or  firmware,  are  highly interdependent  and  interrelated  and  are  accounted  for  as  a  combined  performance  obligation.  The  revenues  for  this  combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product is delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer. Our hardware business also earns revenues from the sale of hardware support contracts purchased by our customers at their option and that are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are  delivered  over  the  contractual  term,  which  is  generally  one  year.  The  majority  of  our  hardware  products  are  sold  through indirect channels such as independent distributors and value-added resellers and we also market and sell our hardware products through our direct sales force. Operating expenses associated with our hardware business include the cost of hardware products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internal manufacturing operations or by third-party manufacturers, warranty and related expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact of  inventory  determined  to  be  excess  and  obsolete;  the  cost  of  materials  used  to  repair  customer  products  with  eligible support contracts; the cost of labor and infrastructure to provide support services; and sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of our hardware offerings.\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "We believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factors, including the breadth of a company's product line, the strength and reach of its channels to market, technological innovation, product development execution, technical support, customer service, quality, reliability, price and manufacturing capacity and capabilities. In addition, manufacturing process and package technologies that provide differentiated levels of performance and a structural cost advantage are competitive factors for our analog products, and customers' prior investments in software development is a competitive factor for our embedded processing products.\n\n## Market cycle\n\nThe 'semiconductor cycle' refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand and the building and depleting of inventories. The semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand and/or insufficient manufacturing capacity, followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand and/or excess manufacturing capacity. These are typically referred to as upturns and downturns in the semiconductor cycle. Semiconductor cycles are affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nOur revenue is subject to some seasonal variation. Historically, our sequential revenue growth rate tends to be weaker in the first and fourth quarters when compared with the second and third quarters.\n\n## Customers, sales and distribution\n\nWe sell our products to over 100,000 customers. Our customer base is diverse, with more than 40% of our revenue derived from customers outside our largest 100.\n\nWe market and sell our products through direct sales channels, including our website and broad sales and applications team, and, to a lesser extent, through distributors. Over the past several years, we have been investing in new capabilities to build closer direct customer relationships. For example, in 2021 about two-thirds of our revenue was direct, and transactions on TI.com grew to about 10% of our revenue, as customers valued the convenience of purchasing online. Closer direct relationships with our customers help to strengthen our reach of market channel advantage and give us access to more customers and more of their design projects, leading to opportunities to sell more of our products into each design. Additionally, broader and deeper access gives us better insight and knowledge of customer needs.\n\nOur investments in new and improved capabilities to directly support our customers include website and e-commerce enhancements as well as inventory consignment programs and order fulfillment services. We expanded the reach of our TI.com e-commerce channel by offering a localized online experience in many countries, with convenience features such as immediate availability, local currency, payment methods, invoicing and importer of record. In addition to doing business directly with TI, we offer customers the option of using a single worldwide distributor and a few region-specific distributors for order fulfillment.\n\n## Manufacturing\n\nSemiconductor manufacturing begins with a sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer. Each device on the wafer is packaged and tested. The entire process takes place in highly specialized facilities that require substantial investments.\n\nWe own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facilities in North America, Asia, Japan and Europe. These include both wafer fabrication and assembly/test facilities.\n\nWe invest in manufacturing technologies and do most of our manufacturing in-house. This strategic decision to make manufacturing and technology a core competitive advantage provides us with tangible benefits of lower manufacturing costs and greater control of our supply chain. We have focused on creating a competitive manufacturing structural cost advantage by investing in our advanced 300-millimeter capacity. An unpackaged chip built on a 300-millimeter wafer costs about 40% less than an unpackaged chip built on a 200-millimeter wafer.",

Texas Instruments, on the other hand, focuses on external factors such as changes in U.S. or international tax laws and market conditions that could affect future taxable income, leading to adjustments in valuation allowances.

Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made.\n\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In order for  us  to  realize  our  deferred  tax  assets,  we  must  be  able  to  generate  sufficient  taxable  income  in  those  jurisdictions  where  the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination, or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to our provision for income taxes at such time.\n\nWe calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known, which can materially impact our effective tax rate.\n\nThe amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed  assessments.  Our  estimate  of  the  potential  outcome  for  any  uncertain  tax  issue  may  require  certain  judgments.  A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under 'Business Combinations' above.\n\nFor those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740, Income Taxes ,  which  contains  a  two-step  approach  to  recognizing  and  measuring  uncertain  tax  positions  taken  or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, judicial rulings, and refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made. Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties.\n\n## Legal and Other Contingencies\n\nWe are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. A description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under 'Business Combinations' above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business  combination,  we  accrue  a  liability  for  an  estimated  loss  if  the  potential  loss  from  any  claim  or  legal  proceeding  is considered probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to  these  matters,  accruals  are  based  only  on  the  best  information  available  at  the  time  the  accruals  are  made.  As  additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and",

The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the interpretation and application of complex tax laws, and significant judgment is necessary to (i) determine whether, based on the technical merits, a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and (ii) measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. Although we believe the estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals.\n\nAs part of our financial process, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered. If recovery is not likely, the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable. Our judgment regarding future recoverability of our deferred tax assets may change due to various factors, including changes in U.S. or international tax laws and changes in market conditions and their impact on our assessment of taxable income in future periods. These changes, if any, may require adjustments to the valuation allowances and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period when such determinations are made.\n\n## Inventory valuation allowances\n\nInventory is valued net of allowances for unsalable or obsolete raw materials, work in process and finished goods. Statistical allowances are determined quarterly for raw materials and work in process based on historical disposals of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons. For finished goods, quarterly statistical allowances are determined by comparing inventory levels of individual parts to historical shipments, current backlog and estimated future sales in order to identify inventory considered unlikely to be sold. A specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance, such as an end-of-life part or demand with imminent risk of cancellation. Allowances are also calculated quarterly for instances where inventoried costs for individual products are in excess of the net realizable value for those products. Actual future write-offs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons may differ from estimates and calculations used to determine valuation allowances due to changes in customer demand, customer negotiations, technology shifts and other factors.\n\n## Commitments and contingencies\n\nSee Note 10 to the financial statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies.",

      "answer": "ACN reclassified prior period amounts to align with the new EMEA geographic market presentation, which affected the comparability of operating income growth of $786 million or 9% for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. TXN, on the other hand, reclassified certain prior period financial amounts to conform to the 2023 presentation, which ensures consistency within TXN's own reporting but does not directly tie to specific operating income growth figures. The reclassification practices of both companies affect the ability to directly compare their operating income growth because each company modifies its historical data differently to align with current reporting standards, making cross-company comparisons more complex without adjusting for these reclassifications.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - ACN reclassified prior period amounts due to a change in geographic market presentation (EMEA), which directly affected the comparability of operating income growth ($786 million or 9%) between fiscal 2023 and 2024.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - TXN reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to the 2023 presentation, but no specific operating income growth metric is tied to this reclassification.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both ACN and TXN reclassified prior period amounts, but the impact on operating income comparability differs. ACN's reclassification directly affects growth analysis, while TXN's ensures internal consistency without a stated effect on growth metrics. This makes cross-company comparability of operating income growth more nuanced and dependent on understanding each company's reclassification adjustments."

      "question": "What is the difference in how AVGO and QCOM disclose the financial impact of research and development expenditures, and how does this difference relate to QCOM's specific tax treatment of R&D expenditures at a 13% effective rate?",
      "answer": "AVGO highlights that the timing and amount of research and development expenditures are key factors affecting its operating results, emphasizing the uncertainty and volatility R&D spending introduces into quarterly financial performance. QCOM, on the other hand, explicitly ties its R&D expenditures to tax treatment, noting that under U.S. federal tax law, it must capitalize these expenditures and benefits from a 13% effective tax rate on a significant portion of its income. The difference in disclosure shows that while both companies engage in R&D, QCOM specifically links its expenditures to preferential tax treatment, which AVGO does not disclose. This means QCOM\u2019s R&D spending has a defined tax implication at a lower effective rate, whereas AVGO\u2019s R&D spending volatility directly affects its operating margins without a stated tax offset.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From AVGO's filing, extract that R&D expenditures are a key factor affecting operating results and contribute to financial volatility.",
        "Step 2: From QCOM's filing, extract the explicit mention of capitalizing R&D expenditures for tax purposes and the 13% effective tax rate applied to a significant portion of its income.",
        "Step 3: Compare the two disclosures to show that while both companies incur R&D costs, only QCOM provides specific tax treatment related to these expenditures, which AVGO does not disclose.",
        "Step 4: Conclude that the difference lies in QCOM\u2019s explicit linkage of R&D spending to a preferential tax regime, while AVGO focuses on the operational volatility of such spending."

      "answer": "ACN reclassified prior period amounts due to the movement of Middle East and Africa market units into the EMEA geographic market, which affected the presentation of operating income by region, such as a 9% increase in overall operating income and specific changes in EMEA driven by foreign exchange rates and cost reductions. Meanwhile, INTC adjusted all prior-period amounts in its goodwill footnote to reflect changes in operating segments, reallocating goodwill among reporting units based on relative fair value. Both companies modified historical financial reporting to align with current segment structures, enhancing comparability and performance evaluation across periods, though through different financial mechanisms\u2014ACN through geographic market realignment and INTC through goodwill reallocation.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - ACN revised the reporting of its geographic markets in fiscal 2024, moving Middle East and Africa from Growth Markets to EMEA, with prior period amounts reclassified accordingly.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both ACN and INTC modified prior period financial data to align with current reporting structures, with ACN focusing on geographic market consistency and INTC on segment-based goodwill allocation, thereby enhancing internal financial comparability and performance tracking."

      "answer": "Intel (INTC) faces supply chain constraints due to reliance on a limited number of suppliers, such as ASML for EUV photolithography tools, which are critical for Intel 4 and subsequent manufacturing process nodes. These constraints can delay product development and ramp, increasing costs and reducing pricing power. Accenture (ACN) depends heavily on alliances with key ecosystem partners whose technologies underpin a significant portion of ACN\u2019s services and solutions. If these partners shift priorities or form closer ties with ACN\u2019s competitors, ACN may struggle to differentiate its offerings and maintain favorable pricing. Together, these risks mean both companies face challenges in preserving pricing power: INTC due to production bottlenecks and ACN due to competitive dynamics in its ecosystem, each undermining their ability to set or maintain target pricing in a competitive environment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source ACN - Accenture\u2019s profitability is negatively impacted by inability to remain competitive, which is tied to its reliance on ecosystem partners and the risk of those partners aligning more closely with competitors.",

      "answer": "The total change in commercial paper outstanding between ACN and INTC is $935 million for ACN in fiscal 2024 versus $0 for INTC in 2023, reflecting a significant difference in short-term financing strategies. ACN utilized its syndicated credit facility to issue $935 million in commercial paper as of August 31, 2024, while INTC had no commercial paper outstanding as of December 30, 2023, having repaid its $3.9 billion commercial paper balance from the prior year. This indicates that ACN maintained access to short-term commercial paper financing, while INTC shifted away from it, relying instead on other forms of borrowing or liquidity.",

QCOM, on the other hand, participates in the IRS Compliance Assurance Process for tax years prior to fiscal 2021, aiming to resolve all issues with the IRS before filing its federal return, which may reduce the likelihood of unexpected tax liabilities.

          "chunk_text": "As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes. We establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged. In evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We evaluate tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax positions are reasonable. However, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for these positions.\n\n## Revenues by Segment/Geographic Market\n\nOur three reportable operating segments are our geographic markets, North America, Europe and Growth Markets. In addition to reporting revenues by geographic market and industry group, we also report revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our geographic markets. Consulting revenues, which include strategy, management and technology consulting and technology integration consulting, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables. Outsourcing revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions.\n\nFrom time to time, our geographic markets work together to sell and implement certain contracts. The resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating geographic markets. Generally, operating expenses for each geographic market have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our geographic markets affect revenues and operating expenses within our geographic markets to differing degrees. The mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our geographic markets. Local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our geographic markets differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses.\n\nWhile we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume. Management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume. Instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements. Revenue for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and the outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors.",

For tax years prior to fiscal 2021, we are participating in the IRS Compliance Assurance Process program whereby we endeavor to agree with the IRS on the treatment of all issues prior to filing our federal return.\n\nStock Repurchases. To reflect share repurchases in the consolidated balance sheet, we (i) reduce common stock for the par value of the shares, (ii) reduce paid-in capital for the amount in excess of par to zero during the quarter in which the shares are repurchased and (iii) record the residual amount, if any, to retained earnings.\n\nIn August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was enacted in the United States, which included, among other items, a 1% excise tax on certain net stock repurchases after December 31, 2022. Any such excise tax on our stock repurchases will be recorded as a component of stockholders' equity.\n\nEarnings (Loss) Per Share. Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the combination of the weighted-average number of dilutive common share equivalents, comprised of shares issuable under our share-based compensation plans and shares subject to accelerated share repurchase programs, if any, and the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period.

During fiscal 2022, Other income (expense) decreased $238 million from fiscal 2021, primarily due to lower gains on investments.

      "answer": "ACN faces higher financial exposure from client contract cancellations because many of its consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration and can be terminated with as little as 30 days' notice, leading to potential revenue loss with limited time to replace it. In contrast, ADBE recognizes consulting revenue on a time-and-materials or relative performance basis, meaning it earns revenue progressively as services are delivered, reducing the risk of unrecovered costs from sudden cancellations. This difference in contract duration and revenue recognition timing means ACN is more vulnerable to abrupt revenue shortfalls, while ADBE's approach aligns revenue with service delivery and mitigates financial impact from late-stage cancellations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From ACN's 10-K, we learn that many of its consulting contracts are less than 12 months long and can be terminated with 30 days' notice, creating significant risk of sudden revenue loss.",
        "Step 2: From ADBE's 10-K, we learn that consulting contracts are sold on time-and-materials and fixed-fee bases, with revenue recognized as services are performed (time-and-materials) or on a relative performance basis (fixed-fee), aligning revenue with actual service delivery.",
        "Step 3: Synthesizing both, ACN's shorter contract duration and lumpier revenue exposure increases its financial risk from cancellations, while ADBE's progressive revenue recognition reduces the impact of late-stage cancellations by recognizing revenue as value is delivered."

          "chunk_text": "Technological developments may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients and, in the case of cloud and as-a-service solutions, could affect the nature of how we generate revenue. Some of these technological developments have reduced and replaced some of our historical services and solutions and may continue to do so in the future. This has caused, and may in the future cause, clients to delay spending under existing contracts and engagements and to delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate new technologies. Such technological developments and spending delays can negatively impact our results of operations if we are unable to introduce new pricing or commercial models that reflect the value of these technological developments or if the pace and level of spending on new technologies are not sufficient to make up any shortfall.\n\nDevelopments in the industries we serve, which may be rapid, also could shift demand to new services and solutions. If, as a result of new technologies or changes in the industries we serve, our clients demand new services and solutions, we may be less competitive in these new areas or need to make significant investment to meet that demand. Our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas. If we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and adapt to industry developments, or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale, or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation, our services and solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and to execute on our growth strategy could be adversely affected.\n\nIn a particular geographic market, service or industry group, a small number of clients have contributed, or may, in the future contribute, a significant portion of the revenues of such geographic market, service or industry group, and any decision by such a client to delay, reduce, or eliminate spending on our services and solutions could have a disproportionate impact on the results of operations in the relevant geographic market, service or industry group.\n\nMany of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration, and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days' notice. Longer-term, larger and more complex contracts, such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts, generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us, but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated ongoing revenues and profits lost upon termination of the contract. Many of our contracts allow clients to terminate, delay, reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide. Additionally, a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project, try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work. When contracts are terminated or not renewed, we lose the anticipated revenues, and it may take significant time to replace the level of revenues lost. Consequently, our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected. The specific business or financial condition of a client, changes in management and changes in a client's strategy are also all factors that can result in terminations, cancellations or delays.\n\n## If we are unable to match people and their skills with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to keep our people with market-leading skills and capabilities in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain people with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally. We must hire or reskill, retain and inspire appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients across the globe, respond quickly to rapid and ongoing changes in demand, technology, industry and the macroeconomic environment, and continuously innovate to grow our business. For example, if we are unable to hire or retrain our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuous changes in technology and the industries we serve, we may not be able to innovate and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand. There is competition for scarce talent with market-leading skills and capabilities in new technologies, and our people have been directly targeted because of their highly soughtafter skills and this will likely continue.\n\nThere is a risk that at certain points in time, we may have more people than we need in certain skill sets or geographies or at compensation levels that are not aligned with skill sets. In these situations, we have engaged, and may in the future engage, in actions to rebalance our workforce, including reducing the rate of new hires and increasing involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of people and skills in balance with client demand. At certain times and in certain geographical regions, we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current and/or future demand. In these cases, we might need to redeploy existing people or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs. If we are not successful in these initiatives, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nIf our utilization rate is too high or too low, it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition, the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects.\n\nWe are particularly dependent on retaining members of Accenture Leadership with critical capabilities. If we are unable to do so, our ability to innovate, generate new business opportunities and effectively lead large and complex transformations and client relationships could be jeopardized. We depend on identifying, developing and retaining top talent to innovate and lead",

          "chunk_text": "Technological developments may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients and, in the case of cloud and as-a-service solutions, could affect the nature of how we generate revenue. Some of these technological developments have reduced and replaced some of our historical services and solutions and may continue to do so in the future. This has caused, and may in the future cause, clients to delay spending under existing contracts and engagements and to delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate new technologies. Such technological developments and spending delays can negatively impact our results of operations if we are unable to introduce new pricing or commercial models that reflect the value of these technological developments or if the pace and level of spending on new technologies are not sufficient to make up any shortfall.\n\nDevelopments in the industries we serve, which may be rapid, also could shift demand to new services and solutions. If, as a result of new technologies or changes in the industries we serve, our clients demand new services and solutions, we may be less competitive in these new areas or need to make significant investment to meet that demand. Our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas. If we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and adapt to industry developments, or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale, or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation, our services and solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and to execute on our growth strategy could be adversely affected.\n\nIn a particular geographic market, service or industry group, a small number of clients have contributed, or may, in the future contribute, a significant portion of the revenues of such geographic market, service or industry group, and any decision by such a client to delay, reduce, or eliminate spending on our services and solutions could have a disproportionate impact on the results of operations in the relevant geographic market, service or industry group.\n\nMany of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration, and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days' notice. Longer-term, larger and more complex contracts, such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts, generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us, but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated ongoing revenues and profits lost upon termination of the contract. Many of our contracts allow clients to terminate, delay, reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide. Additionally, a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project, try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work. When contracts are terminated or not renewed, we lose the anticipated revenues, and it may take significant time to replace the level of revenues lost. Consequently, our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected. The specific business or financial condition of a client, changes in management and changes in a client's strategy are also all factors that can result in terminations, cancellations or delays.\n\n## If we are unable to match people and their skills with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to keep our people with market-leading skills and capabilities in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain people with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally. We must hire or reskill, retain and inspire appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients across the globe, respond quickly to rapid and ongoing changes in demand, technology, industry and the macroeconomic environment, and continuously innovate to grow our business. For example, if we are unable to hire or retrain our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuous changes in technology and the industries we serve, we may not be able to innovate and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand. There is competition for scarce talent with market-leading skills and capabilities in new technologies, and our people have been directly targeted because of their highly soughtafter skills and this will likely continue.\n\nThere is a risk that at certain points in time, we may have more people than we need in certain skill sets or geographies or at compensation levels that are not aligned with skill sets. In these situations, we have engaged, and may in the future engage, in actions to rebalance our workforce, including reducing the rate of new hires and increasing involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of people and skills in balance with client demand. At certain times and in certain geographical regions, we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current and/or future demand. In these cases, we might need to redeploy existing people or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs. If we are not successful in these initiatives, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nIf our utilization rate is too high or too low, it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition, the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects.\n\nWe are particularly dependent on retaining members of Accenture Leadership with critical capabilities. If we are unable to do so, our ability to innovate, generate new business opportunities and effectively lead large and complex transformations and client relationships could be jeopardized. We depend on identifying, developing and retaining top talent to innovate and lead",

Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\n\n## Subscription, Product and Services Offerings\n\nWe enter into revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of cloud-enabled subscriptions, cloudhosted  offerings,  term-based,  royalty,  and  perpetual  software  licenses,  associated  software  maintenance  and  support  plans, consulting services, training and technical support. Certain revenue arrangements provide customers with unilateral cancellation rights,  or  options  to  either  renew  monthly  on-premise  term-based  licenses  or  use  committed  funds  to  purchase  other  Adobe products or services.\n\nFully  hosted  subscription  services  (SaaS)  allow  customers  to  access  hosted  software  during  the  contractual  term  without taking possession of the software. Cloud-hosted subscription services may be sold on a fee-per-subscription period basis or based on consumption or usage.\n\nWe recognize revenue ratably over the contractual service term for hosted services that are priced based on a committed number of transactions where the delivery and consumption of the benefit of the services occur evenly over time, beginning on the date the services associated with the committed transactions are first made available to the customer and continuing through the end of the contractual service term. Over-usage fees and fees based on the actual number of transactions are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred and are included in the transaction price of an arrangement as variable consideration. Fees based on a number of transactions, where invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer benefit and consumption, are typically  accounted  for  utilizing  the  'as-invoiced'  practical  expedient.  Revenue  for  subscriptions  sold  as  a  fee  per  period  is recognized ratably over the contractual term as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of the underlying service.\n\nWhen cloud-enabled services are highly integrated and interrelated with on-premise software, such as in our cloud-enabled Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings, the individual components are not considered distinct and revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud-enabled services are provided.\n\nThe subscription support plans related to those customer arrangements whose revenues we classify as subscription revenues represent  stand-ready  performance  obligations.  Revenue  from  these  subscription  support  plans  is  recognized  ratably  over  their respective contractual terms and classified as subscription revenue.\n\nLicenses for on-premise software may be purchased on a perpetual basis, as a subscription for a fixed period of time or based on usage for certain of our OEM and royalty agreements. Revenue from non-cloud enabled on-premise licenses without unilateral cancellation rights or monthly renewal options is recognized at the point in time the software is available to the customer, provided all  other  revenue  recognition  criteria  are  met,  and  classified  as  product  revenue  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income. Revenue  from  on-premise  term  license  or  term  licensing  arrangements  with  unilateral  cancellation  rights  or  monthly  renewal options, and any associated maintenance and support, is classified as subscription revenue.\n\nOur services and other revenue is comprised primarily of fees related to consulting, training, maintenance and support for certain on-premise licenses that are recognized at a point in time and our advertising offerings. We typically sell our consulting contracts on a time-and-materials and fixed-fee basis. These revenues are recognized as the services are performed for time and materials contracts and on a relative performance basis for fixed-fee contracts. Training revenues are recognized as the services are performed. Our maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers, partners and developers to receive desktop product upgrades and enhancements or technical support, depending on the offering, are generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement.  Our  transaction-based  advertising  offerings,  where  fees  are  based  on  a  number  of  impressions  per  month  and invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer benefit and consumption, are typically accounted for utilizing the 'asinvoiced' practical expedient.\n\n## Judgments\n\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services. For example, some of our offerings include both onpremise and/or on-device software licenses and cloud services.

      "answer": "CRM discloses that it has not incurred any material costs or accrued any material liabilities related to warranty or indemnification obligations, and maintains director and officer insurance to recover a portion of any future indemnification payments. In contrast, TXN discloses that while it has a low historical rate of payments on product claims, it may face product claim considerations that exceed the price of its products, though it also states that there have been no material accruals or payments regarding product warranty or liability in the periods presented. Both companies indicate low financial exposure, but TXN acknowledges a broader potential for higher-value claims compared to CRM's consistently minimal exposure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from CRM's filing - 'To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such obligations and has not accrued any material liabilities related to such obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.'",
        "Step 2: Extract from TXN's filing - 'Product claim consideration may exceed the price of our products... Although we cannot predict the likelihood or amount of any future claims, we do not believe they will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.'",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While both companies report no material financial impact from warranty obligations, TXN explicitly acknowledges the potential for claims exceeding product price, indicating a broader risk profile compared to CRM's consistently minimal exposure."

The Company may also be subject to indemnification obligations by law with respect to the actions of its employees under certain circumstances and in certain jurisdictions.\n\n## New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in Fiscal 2025\n\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-07, 'Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures' ('ASU 2023-07'), which requires additional operating segment disclosures in annual and interim consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025 on a retrospective basis.\n\n## New Accounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-09, 'Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures' ('ASU 2023-09'), which requires disclosure of disaggregated income taxes paid, prescribes standard categories for the components of the effective tax rate reconciliation and modifies other income tax-related disclosures. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 on a retrospective or prospective basis. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2023-09 will have on its financial statement disclosures.\n\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2024-03, 'Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses' ('ASU 2024-03'), which requires disaggregation of certain costs in a separate note to the financial statements, such as the amounts of employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization, included in each relevant expense caption in annual and interim consolidated financial statements. ASU 2024-03 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027 on a retrospective or prospective basis, with early adoption permitted.

Furthermore, governments' responses to macroeconomic factors and tax revenue needs may lead to tax rule changes that could materially and adversely affect our cash flows and financial results.\n\n## We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that have in the past and could in the future negatively impact our financial results and cash flows from changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar versus local currencies.\n\nWe primarily conduct our business in the following regions: the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. The expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets, including in emerging markets. This exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies, growth in our international investments, additional headcount in foreign locations, and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Specifically, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to currency fluctuations primarily in Euro, British Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real and Indian Rupee against the U.S. Dollar. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, economic and political conditions change and evolving tax regulations come into effect. The fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period. Furthermore, fluctuations in foreign currency ex change rates, combined with the seasonality of our business, could affect our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings.\n\nAdditionally, global events as well as geopolitical developments, including the war in Ukraine and regional conflict in the Middle East, fluctuating commodity prices, uncertainty regarding changes in trade policy and inflation, have caused, and may in the future cause, global economic uncertainty and uncertainty about the interest rate environment, which has and could in the future amplify the volatility of currency fluctuations. Although we attempt to mitigate some of this volatility and related risks through foreign currency hedging, our hedging activities are limited in scope and may not effectively offset the adverse financial impacts that may result from unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\n\n## Our debt service obligations, lease commitments and other contractual obligations may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nAs of January 31, 2025, we had a substantial level of outstanding debt, including our Senior Notes. We are also party to the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement, which provides for our $5.0 billion Credit Facility. Although there were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility as of January 31, 2025, we may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the Credit Facility for general corporate purposes.\n\nIn addition to the outstanding and potential debt obligations above, we have also recorded substantial liabilities associated with noncancellable future payments on our long-term lease agreements. We also have significant other contractual commitments, including leases that have not yet commenced and commitments with infrastructure service providers, which are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nMaintenance of our indebtedness and contractual commitments and any additional issuances of indebtedness could:\n\n- impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital ex penditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes;\n- cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations toward debt service obligations and principal repayments; and\n- make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general.\n\nOur ability to meet our ex penses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulations. Further, our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt or contractual obligations resulting from our leases. If we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt. If we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due, we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness, seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. Any new or refinanced debt may be subject to substantially higher interest rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition and impact our business.\n\nIn addition, adverse changes by any rating agency to our credit ratings may negatively impact our reputation, the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities, as well as the potential costs associated with a refinancing of our debt. Downgrades in our credit ratings could also affect the terms of any such refinancing or future financing or restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\n\nThe indentures governing our Senior Notes and the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance with specified covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. A failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our outstanding debt could result in",

Our non-U.S. entities own assets or liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars or other currencies, and exchange rate fluctuations in those jurisdictions may impact our effectiv e tax rate.\n\nOur balance sheet also reflects amounts remeasured from non-U.S. dollar currencies. Because most of the aggregate non-U.S. dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by forward currency exchange contracts, which are based on year-end 2024 balances and currency exchange rates, a hypothetical 10% plus or minus fluctuation in non-U.S. currency exchange rates relativ e to the U.S. dollar would result in a pretax currency exchange gain or loss of less than $1 million.\n\nWe use these forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuations may hav e on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. As of December 31, 2024, we had forward currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional v alue of $565 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures (including $180 million to buy Indian rupee, $91 million to sell British pounds and $78 million to sell Japanese yen).

      "answer": "Salesforce reported accrued expenses and other liabilities of $372 million and operating lease liabilities of $3,162 million, resulting in a ratio of 11.8%. Texas Instruments reported accrued expenses and other liabilities of $911 million and operating lease liabilities of $3,320 million, resulting in a ratio of 27.4%. This indicates that Texas Instruments carries a significantly higher proportion of accrued expenses and other liabilities relative to its operating lease obligations compared to Salesforce.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From Salesforce's 10-K filing, extract accrued expenses and other liabilities of $372 million and total operating lease liabilities of $3,162 million.",
        "Step 2: From Texas Instruments' 10-K filing, extract accrued expenses and other liabilities of $911 million and total current liabilities of $3,320 million, which includes operating lease obligations.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the ratio of accrued expenses and other liabilities to operating lease liabilities for both companies: $372M / $3,162M = 11.8% for Salesforce and $911M / $3,320M = 27.4% for Texas Instruments.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize the comparison by interpreting the differences in these ratios in the context of their capital intensity models\u2014Salesforce being more service-oriented with higher lease liabilities, and Texas Instruments being more manufacturing-intensive with higher accrued expenses."

      "answer": "CRM explicitly discloses the risk of a 'partial or complete loss of invested capital, or significant changes in the fair value, of our strategic investment portfolio' as part of its risk factors, highlighting the potential negative impact on its financial condition. In contrast, TXN includes investment gains and losses as part of 'Other income,' which also encompasses interest, royalty, and lease income. This difference shows that CRM emphasizes the risk and volatility associated with strategic investments in its qualitative disclosures, while TXN integrates investment outcomes into a broader category of non-operational income, reflecting a more aggregated reporting approach.",

        "Step 1: From CRM's 10-K, extract the specific risk disclosure related to strategic investments: 'partial or complete loss of invested capital, or significant changes in the fair value, of our strategic investment portfolio.'",
        "Step 2: From TXN's 10-K, extract the classification of investment gains and losses as part of 'Other income,' which also includes interest, royalty, and lease income.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the two approaches \u2014 CRM emphasizes the risk of investment losses in its qualitative risk disclosures, while TXN reports investment outcomes in a consolidated income category \u2014 revealing distinct financial reporting strategies for investment-related activities."

      "question": "How does the expansion into IoT-related offerings by ACN and QCOM's competitive positioning in the IoT semiconductor space reflect the strategic importance and risks associated with the Internet of Things segment for both companies?",
      "answer": "ACN emphasizes its focus on IoT as part of its broader digital transformation services, highlighting that its financial results depend on adapting to technological changes like IoT to meet evolving client needs. This indicates that IoT is a strategic growth area for ACN, but it also exposes the company to risks from volatile economic conditions that could reduce client spending on IoT initiatives. On the other hand, QCOM competes in the IoT semiconductor space against multiple established players and faces challenges such as long design-in cycles, regulatory requirements, and high reliability standards, which create significant barriers to entry and could increase costs. Together, these insights show that while IoT represents a strategic opportunity for both companies, ACN faces demand-side risks tied to macroeconomic factors, whereas QCOM's challenges are more supply-side and operational due to the nature of semiconductor development and competition.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, ACN identifies IoT as a key technological area within its digital and cloud offerings, indicating strategic importance and exposure to client demand fluctuations.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, QCOM operates in the IoT semiconductor space and faces intense competition, long design cycles, and high reliability standards, which pose operational and cost-related risks.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies view IoT as a strategic segment, but their risk profiles differ: ACN is more exposed to demand volatility, while QCOM faces supply-side and competitive pressures."

      "answer": "ACN's effective income tax rate was reduced by 2.1 percentage points in 2023 due to the FDII deduction, while QCOM explicitly references FDII as a special deduction influencing its provision for income taxes. This reveals that both companies leverage the FDII deduction as part of their tax strategy to lower their effective tax rates by capitalizing on foreign-derived intangible income.",

      "answer": "CRM anticipates a potential decrease in its unrecognized tax benefits of an inconsequential amount over the next 12 months. While the exact figure for CRM is not quantified as 'inconsequential,' INTC specifically estimates a potential decrease of up to $314 million in its unrecognized tax benefits during the same period. This comparison highlights that INTC's potential decrease is significantly larger in magnitude than CRM's, which is described as having minimal financial impact.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, CRM disclosed that it anticipates a potential decrease in its unrecognized tax benefits of an 'inconsequential' amount over the next 12 months, without specifying a numerical value.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, INTC provided a precise estimate of a potential decrease in its unrecognized tax benefits of up to $314 million over the next 12 months.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the information by comparing the two disclosures: CRM's decrease is described qualitatively as inconsequential, while INTC provides a specific dollar figure, indicating a much larger potential impact for INTC."

These assets are amortized from the acquisition date. In contrast, INTC does not amortize acquisition-related in-process R&D assets until the projects reach technological feasibility; once completed, these assets are transferred to acquisition-related developed technology and amortized over their useful lives. This difference in amortization timing results in CRM recognizing amortization expenses earlier than INTC for similar types of intangible assets.",

      "answer": "At INTC, the estimated useful lives of certain machinery and equipment in wafer fabrication facilities were increased from 5 to 8 years effective January 2023, which reduces annual depreciation expense going forward. This change was influenced by factors such as process technology cadence, changes in machinery and equipment technology, and reuse of machinery across process generations. At CRM, costs capitalized related to new revenue contracts are amortized over four years \u2014 longer than the typical initial contract period \u2014 based on factors including estimated life cycles of offerings and customer attrition. This amortization period directly affects marketing and sales expense on the income statement. Both companies use straight-line depreciation/amortization methods, but the differing amortization periods reflect distinct operational factors: CRM focuses on customer lifecycle and renewal expectations, while INTC considers technological longevity and manufacturing transitions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from CRM evidence - Capitalized costs for new contracts are amortized over 4 years due to estimated lifecycle of offerings and customer attrition.",

      "answer": "The difference in available credit capacities between AMD and Salesforce highlights varying levels of potential financial flexibility. AMD has a $3 billion revolving credit facility available as of December 28, 2024, while Salesforce has a larger $5 billion revolving credit facility available as of January 31, 2025. With no outstanding borrowings in either case, Salesforce has access to $2 billion more in immediate liquidity, which could provide it with greater capacity to fund strategic initiatives, manage financial shocks, or support operations without needing to raise additional capital. This comparison is grounded in the absence of any drawn amounts in both cases, which ensures the full facilities are available for use.",

      "question": "How does Texas Instruments' exposure to the gaming market through its personal electronics segment compare to Microsoft's Gaming revenue in 2024, and what might this indicate about the relative strategic importance of gaming for each company?",
      "answer": "In 2024, Microsoft reported Gaming revenue of $21.5 billion, which is a significant and growing segment of its business, increasing from $15.47 billion in 2023. In contrast, Texas Instruments lists gaming as one of several subcategories within its Personal Electronics segment, which accounts for 20% of TI's total revenue. This suggests that while gaming is a major and central business area for Microsoft, it is a smaller and less explicitly quantified component within TI's broader personal electronics portfolio.",

        "Step 1: From Microsoft's 10-K, extract Gaming revenue for 2024: $21,503 million.",
        "Step 2: Note that Microsoft's Gaming revenue has increased significantly from $15,466 million in 2023 to $21,503 million in 2024.",
        "Step 3: From Texas Instruments' 10-K, identify that gaming is part of the Personal Electronics segment, which accounts for 20% of TI's total revenue, though no specific dollar figure is given for gaming alone.",
        "Step 4: Compare the explicit and substantial Gaming revenue of Microsoft to the relatively unspecified and smaller role of gaming within TI's broader Personal Electronics segment.",
        "Step 5: Conclude that gaming holds a much more prominent and strategically significant position in Microsoft's business model than it does for Texas Instruments."

      "answer": "Microsoft maintains a minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion in cash investments, which satisfies the requirement in its derivative counterparty agreements to avoid posting collateral. This is critical because these agreements stipulate that Microsoft must maintain investment-grade credit ratings. Microsoft holds a AAA long-term unsecured debt rating, which qualifies as investment-grade and, combined with its liquidity, ensures that no collateral is required to be posted as of June 30, 2024.",

Our objectiv es for holding deriv ativ es include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectiv ely as possible. Our deriv ativ e programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.\n\n## Foreign Currencies\n\nCertain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiv eness of our foreign currency hedge positions.\n\nForeign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar-denominated inv estments are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair v alue hedging instruments. Foreign currency risks related to certain Euro-denominated debt are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments.\n\nCertain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the v ariability in foreign exchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures.\n\n## Interest Rate\n\nInterest rate risks related to certain fixed-rate debt are hedged using interest rate swaps that are designated as fair v alue hedging instruments to effectiv ely conv ert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates.\n\nSecurities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the av erage maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achiev e economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using option, futures, and swap contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in 'Other contracts' in the tables below.\n\n## Equity\n\nSecurities held in our equity inv estments portfolio are subject to market price risk. At times, we may hold options, futures, and swap contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments.\n\n## Credit\n\nOur fixed-income portfolio is div ersified and consists primarily of inv estment-grade securities. We use credit default swap contracts to manage credit exposures relativ e to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio div ersification. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in 'Other contracts' in the tables below.\n\n## Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features\n\nCertain counterparty agreements for deriv ativ e instruments contain prov isions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an inv estment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard conv ention related to ov er-the-counter deriv ativ es. As of June 30, 2024, our long-term unsecured debt rating was AAA, and cash inv estments were in excess of $1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was required to be posted.",

Financial instruments that could subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash deposits, cash equiv alents, short-term inv estments and accounts receiv able. To manage our credit risk exposure, we place cash inv estments in inv estment-grade debt securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. We also limit counterparties on cash deposits and financial deriv ativ e contracts to financial institutions with inv estment-grade ratings.\n\nConcentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receiv able are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas. We maintain allowances for expected returns, disputes, adjustments, incentiv es and credit losses. These allowances are deducted from accounts receiv able on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nAccounts receiv able allowances changed to reflect amounts charged to operating results by $5 million, $3 million and $5 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectiv ely.\n\n## 6. Valuation of debt and equity inv estments and certain liabilities\n\n## Investments measured at fair value\n\nMoney market funds, debt inv estments and mutual funds are stated at fair v alue, which is generally based on market prices or broker quotes. We classify all debt inv estments as av ailable-for-sale. See Fair-value considerations. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded as an increase or decrease, net of taxes, in AOCI on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and any credit losses are recorded as an allowance for credit losses with an offset recognized in OI&amp;E in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nOur mutual funds hold a v ariety of debt and equity inv estments intended to generate returns that offset changes in certain deferred compensation liabilities. We record changes in the fair v alue of these mutual funds and the related deferred compensation liabilities in SG&amp;A.\n\n## Other investments\n\nOur other inv estments include equity-method inv estments and nonmarketable inv estments, which are not measured at fair v alue. These inv estments consist of interests in v enture capital funds and other nonmarketable securities. Gains and losses from equity-method inv estments are recognized in OI&amp;E based on our ownership share of the inv estee's financial results.

In 2022, we had a flatter trend than we historically  observ e as we experienced the uncertainty and impacts, including demand volatility and supply chain disruption, of macroeconomic conditions, the potential for a recession, and the risk for continued COV ID-19-related disruptions or shutdowns.\n\n## Marketing\n\nOur global marketing objectives are to build a strong, well-known, differentiated, and meaningful Intel corporate brand that drives preference with businesses and consumers, and to offer a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid businesses and consumers in making informed choices about technology purchases. The Intel Core processor family and Intel X eontrademarks make up our key CPU brands. This year we introduced our new Intel Core Ultra processors, powering the latest A I PCs, and our Intel X eon 6 processors, built with A I acceleration in every core. Our foundry services business aims to offer leading-edge packaging and process technology, geographically balanced manufacturing capacity, and a world-class IP portfolio.\n\nIn addition to bringing new products to market in 2024, we focus on building brand awareness and driving demand through our own direct marketing and comarketing programs with partners. Our direct marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media, as well as consumer and trade events, industry and consumer communications, and public relations. We market to consumer and commercial audiences. Our key messaging reinforces the Intel brand pillars of ex ceptionally  engineered, collaborativ ely  innov ativ e, and responsibly  built, while emphasiz ing our ability  to bring A I ev ery where across data center, cloud, edge, and PC.\n\nCertain customers participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs. These cooperative advertising and marketing programs broaden the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct marketing. Certain customers are licensed to place Intel logos on computing devices containing our microprocessors and processor technologies, and to use our brands in their marketing activities. The program partially reimburses customers for marketing activities for products featuring Intel brands, subject to customers meeting defined criteria.

In addition, manufacturing process and package technologies that prov ide differentiated lev els of performance and a structural cost adv antage are competitiv e factors for our analog products, and customers' prior inv estments in software dev elopment is a competitiv e factor for our embedded processing products.\n\n## Market cycle\n\nThe 'semiconductor cycle' refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand and the building and depleting of inv entories. The semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand and/or insufficient manufacturing capacity, followed by periods of surplus inv entory caused by weakening demand and/or excess manufacturing capacity. These are typically referred to as upturns and downturns in the semiconductor cycle. Semiconductor cycles are affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nOur rev enue is subject to some seasonal v ariation. Historically, our sequential rev enue growth rate tends to be weaker in the first and fourth quarters when compared with the second and third quarters.\n\n## Customers, sales and distribution\n\nWe sell our products to ov er 100,000 customers. Our customer base is div erse, with about half of our rev enue deriv ed from customers outside of our largest 50.\n\nWe market and sell our products through direct sales channels, including our website and broad sales and marketing team, and, to a lesser extent, through distributors. Ov er the past sev eral years, we hav e been inv esting in new capabilities to build closer direct customer relationships. In 2024, about 80% of our rev enue was direct, which includes TI.com. Our inv estments in new and improv ed capabilities to directly support our customers include order fulfillment serv ices, inv entory programs, business processes and logistics and website and e-commerce capabilities. Closer direct relationships with our customers help to strengthen our reach of market channel adv antage and giv e us access to more customers and more of their design projects, leading to opportunities to sell more of our products into each design. Additionally, broader and deeper access giv es us better insight and knowledge of customer needs.\n\nIn addition to doing business directly with TI, we offer customers the option of using a single worldwide distributor and a few region-specific distributors for order fulfillment.\n\n## Manufacturing\n\nSemiconductor manufacturing begins with a sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer. Each dev ice on the wafer is packaged and tested. The entire process takes place in highly specialized facilities that require substantial inv estments.\n\nWe own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facilities in North America, Asia, Japan and Europe. These include both wafer fabrication and assembly/test facilities.\n\nWe invest in manufacturing technologies and do most of our manufacturing in-house. This strategic decision to make manufacturing and technology a core competitiv e adv antage prov ides us with tangible benefits of lower manufacturing costs and greater control of our supply chain, offering our customers geopolitically dependable capacity. We hav e focused on creating a competitiv e manufacturing structural cost adv antage by inv esting in our adv anced 300mm capacity. An unpackaged chip built on a 300mm wafer costs about 40% less than an unpackaged chip built on a 200mm wafer.\n\nWe continue to inv est to strengthen our competitiv e adv antage in manufacturing and technology as part of our long-term capacity plan to meet demand over time. Semiconductor growth in electronics, particularly in industrial and automotiv e markets, is expected to continue well into the future. Progress and inv estments include:",

During Q3 2024, we concluded that our manufacturing asset portfolio, primarily for our Intel 7 process node, exceeded manufacturing capacity requirements. Upon completing an asset re-use assessment, we impaired certain construction-in-progress assets and accelerated depreciation for certain inuse manufacturing assets that resulted in $3.3 billion of charges in 2024. Our 2024 gross margin also decreased due to lower revenue, higher unit cost primarily from an increased mix of Intel 4 and Intel 7 products, higher period charges due to $922 million in Gaudi A I accelerator inventory-related charges recognized in 2024, and higher factory start-up costs. These 2024 unfavorable gross margin impacts were partially offset by certain favorable gross margin movements in 2024, including lower period charges driven by the sell-through of previously reserved inventory and lower non-accelerator reserves taken, lower period charges related to excess capacity charges, and a benefit recognized for government incentives received under the CHIPS A ct.\n\nWe are making capital investments in furtherance of our strategy. A s of December 28, 2024, our capital investments classified as construction in progress totaled $50.4 billion ($43.4 billion as of December 30, 2023). These assets have not yet been placed into service and have not yet begun depreciating. A s these construction-in-progress assets are placed into service, we expect to incur depreciation expense that impacts future production costs and, ultimately, cost of sales. To the extent we are unable to grow our revenues to offset these production costs, our gross margin and operating income will be unfavorably affected. Additionally, we could incur asset impairments on property, plant, and equipment assets if our strategy is not successful.\n\nMD&amp;A",

Inv entory held at consignment locations is included in our finished goods inv entory.\n\nWe review inv entory quarterly for salability and obsolescence. A statistical allowance is prov ided for inv entory considered unlikely to be sold. The statistical allowance is based on an analysis of historical disposal activ ity, historical customer shipments and age of inv entory. A specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant ev ent not captured by the statistical allowance. We write off inv entory in the period in which disposal occurs.\n\n## Government incentives\n\nIncentiv es prov ided by gov ernment entities are recognized when we hav e reasonable assurance that we will comply with the conditions of the incentiv e, if any, and the incentiv e will be receiv ed. Incentiv es, which include non-income tax incentiv es, related to the acquisition or construction of fixed assets are recognized as a reduction in the carrying amounts of the related assets and reduce depreciation expense ov er the useful liv es of the assets. Incentiv es for specific operating activ ities are offset against the related expense in the period the expense is incurred.\n\nThe U.S. CHIPS and Science Act (CHIPS Act) prov ides funding for manufacturing grants and research inv estments, and it establishes a 25% inv estment tax credit (ITC) for certain inv estments in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing. We expect to benefit from the ITC on qualifying manufacturing inv estments through 2034. We have also entered into an agreement with the U.S. Department of Commerce to receiv e direct funding of up to $1.6 billion for our three large-scale 300mm wafer fabs currently under construction in Sherman, Texas, and Lehi, Utah. Direct funding of the award will be based on the achiev ement of certain milestones. The agreement contains representations, warranties and cov enants that relate to compliance with requirements for awards provided for in the CHIPS Act. In addition, the agreement includes certain ev ents of default and related rights and remedies, including clawbacks.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we hav e recognized $3.15 billion of CHIPS Act receiv ables, which are comprised of $904 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $2.25 billion in other long-term assets. We hav e also recognized deferred income of $600 million in other long-term liabilities for eligible expenditures that hav e not yet been incurred. See Note 11 for additional information.\n\nIn 2024, the total cash benefit related to the ITC was $588 million, which was used to reduce our income taxes payable. The CHIPS Act ITC and direct funding incentiv es hav e reduced the carrying amounts of manufacturing assets by $3.14 billion, of which $1.78 billion was recognized in 2024. Cost of rev enue benefited by $159 million and $45 million from the CHIPS Act incentiv es, recognized as a reduction of depreciation expense in 2024 and 2023, respectiv ely.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment and other capitalized costs\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated ov er their estimated useful liv es using the straight-line method. Our cost basis includes certain assets acquired in business combinations that were initially recorded at fair v alue as of the date of acquisition. Leasehold improv ements are amortized using the straight-line method ov er the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful liv es of the improv ements. We amortize acquisition-related intangibles on a straight-line basis ov er the estimated economic life of the assets. Capitalized software licenses are generally amortized on a straight-line basis ov er the term of the license. Fully depreciated or amortized assets are written off against accumulated depreciation or amortization.\n\n## Impairments of long-lived assets\n\nWe regularly rev iew whether facts or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying v alues of property, plant and equipment or other long-liv ed assets, including intangible assets, are impaired. We assess the recov erability of assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with those assets to their respectiv e carrying amounts. Any impairment charge is based on the excess of the carrying amount ov er the fair v alue of those assets. Fair v alue is determined by av ailable market v aluations, if applicable, or by discounted cash flows.",

In contrast, TXN notes that government incentives may be subject to clawback or modification, and these are likely treated as operating-related, directly affecting income.

We record capital-related incentives as a reduction to property, plant, and equipment, net within our Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognize a reduction to depreciation expense over the useful life of the corresponding acquired asset. We record operating-related incentives as a reduction to expense in the same line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as the expenditure for which the incentive is intended to compensate.\n\n## Fair Value\n\nWhen determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, as well as assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Our financial assets are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, except for equity securities measured using the measurement alternative, equity method investments, certain other receivables, and grants receivable. We assess fair value hierarchy levels for our issued debt and fixed-income investment portfolio based on the underlying instrument type.\n\nThe three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are:\n\n- Level 1. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. We evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether a market is active.\n- Level 2. Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in less active markets, or modelderived valuations. A ll significant inputs used in our valuations, such as discounted cash flows, are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. We use yield curves, overnight indexed swap curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings as significant inputs in our valuations. Level 2 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices, as well as quoted prices that were adjusted for security-specific restrictions. When we use non-binding market consensus prices, we corroborate them with quoted market prices for similar instruments or compare them to output from internally developed pricing models such as discounted cash flow models.\n- Level 3. Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or liabilities. We monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help confirm that the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset and liability classes. Level 3 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices, non-binding broker quotes, and probability-weighted outcomes that we are unable to corroborate with observable market data.\n\n## Equity Investments\n\nWe regularly invest in equity securities of public and private companies to promote business and strategic objectives. Equity investments are measured and recorded as follows:\n\n- Marketable equity investments are equity securities with RDFV  that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value, whether realized or unrealized, recorded through the income statement.\n- Non-marketable equity investments are equity securities without RDFV  that are measured and recorded using a measurement alternative that measures the securities at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes.\n- Equity method investments are equity securities in investees we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence. Equity method investments are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus our share of equity method investee income or loss.\n\nRealized and unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value or the sale of our equity investments are recorded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net . The carrying value of our non-marketable equity investments is adjusted for qualifying observable price changes resulting from the issuance of similar or identical securities in an orderly transaction by the same issuer. Determining whether an observed transaction is similar to a security within our portfolio requires judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities.\n\nNon-marketable equity investments and equity method investments (collectively referred to as non-marketable equity investments) are also subject to periodic impairment reviews. Our quarterly impairment analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factors. When indicators of impairment exist, we prepare quantitative assessments of the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments using both the market and income approaches.\n\nFinancial Statem ents\n\nNotes to C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents\n\n64",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis also contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in 'Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements' and 'Risk Factors' in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nWe use the terms 'Accenture,' 'we,' 'our' and 'us' in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to 'fiscal 2024' means the 12-month period that ended on August 31, 2024. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.\n\nWe use the term 'in local currency' so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results 'in local currency' are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior-year period's foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results  where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.\n\n## Overview\n\nAccenture is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services and solutions across Strategy &amp; Consulting, Technology, Operations, Industry X  and Song. We serve clients in three geographic markets: North A merica, EM EA  (Europe, M iddle East and A frica) and Growth M arkets (A sia Pacific and Latin A merica). We combine our strength in technology and leadership in cloud, data and A I with unmatched industry experience, functional expertise and global delivery capability to help the world's leading organizations build their digital core, optimize their operations, accelerate revenue growth and enhance services-creating tangible value at speed and scale. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, our Latin A merica market unit will move from Growth M arkets to North America. With this change, North A merica will become the A mericas market and Growth M arkets will become the A sia Pacific market.\n\nOur results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, the overall inflationary environment and levels of business confidence. There continues to be significant economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which has impacted and may continue to impact our business. These conditions have slowed the pace and level of client spending, particularly for smaller contracts with a shorter duration and for our consulting services. Clients continue to prioritize large-scale transformations, which convert to revenue over a longer period.\n\n## Key Metrics\n\nKey metrics for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 are included below. We have presented operating income, operating margin, effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP or 'adjusted' basis to exclude the impact of $438 million and $1,063 million, respectively, in business optimization costs recorded during fiscal 2024 and 2023 and, with respect to effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share, the impact of a $253 million investment gain related to our investment in Duck Creek Technologies recorded during fiscal 2023 as discussed further in our Results of Operations. For additional information regarding business optimization costs, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant A ccounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\n- Revenues of $64.9 billion, an increase of 1% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currency;\n- New bookings of $81.2 billion, an increase of 13% in U.S. dollars and 14% in local currency;\n- Operating margin of 14.8% , compared to 13.7% in fiscal 2023; adjusted operating margin was 15.5% compared to 15.4% in fiscal 2023;\n- Diluted earnings per share of $11.44, a 6% increase over $10.77 for fiscal 2023; adjusted earnings per share increased 2% to $11.95 compared to $11.67 for fiscal 2023; and\n- Cash returned to shareholders of $7.8 billion, including share purchases of $4.5 billion and dividends of $3.2 billion.",

      "question": "How do the specific structures of executive compensation disclosures in Salesforce (CRM) and IBM's 2023 10-K filings reflect differences in their corporate governance approaches, particularly in terms of transparency and risk alignment?",
      "answer": "Salesforce (CRM) incorporates executive compensation details by reference to its Proxy Statement, specifically citing sections like 'Compensation Discussion and Analysis,' 'Committee Reports,' and 'Executive Compensation and Other Matters.' IBM, on the other hand, provides more granular cross-references in its 10-K, listing detailed captions such as '2023 Summary Compensation Table,' '2023 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table,' '2023 Potential Payments Upon Termination Table,' and 'Compensation Program as It Relates to Risk.' These differences suggest that IBM's approach to corporate governance emphasizes detailed transparency around executive pay structures and risk alignment, while Salesforce maintains a more streamlined disclosure framework, relying on Proxy Statement incorporation without specifying individual compensation tables. This contrast in disclosure depth and categorization reveals differing philosophies: IBM's detailed labeling may cater to investor scrutiny and regulatory expectations, whereas Salesforce's approach implies a more consolidated, possibly higher-level governance perspective.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - The level of detail in IBM's disclosures indicates a more comprehensive and structured approach to executive compensation transparency, with explicit references to risk alignment and termination payouts. Salesforce's approach is more consolidated, relying on Proxy Statement incorporation without itemizing specific compensation tables, suggesting a potentially higher-level governance strategy."

      "answer": "Microsoft reported a 23% increase in cloud revenue, reaching $137.4 billion in fiscal year 2024, reflecting recognized revenue from cloud-based solutions like Azure and Office 365. Oracle, on the other hand, disclosed that its deferred cloud services revenues are typically recognized ratably or based on customer usage over the contractual periods, which are usually billed in advance. This indicates that Oracle may not immediately recognize the full value of multi-year cloud contracts upfront, unlike Microsoft, which reports recognized cloud revenue growth. The contrast reveals that Microsoft's financial reporting reflects active usage and consumption-based or recurring revenue realization, while Oracle's approach aligns revenue recognition more closely with service delivery timelines, potentially smoothing out revenue over the contract term.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Microsoft's cloud revenue increased by 23% to $137.4 billion in fiscal year 2024.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - The difference in revenue reporting approaches shows that Microsoft reports recognized growth in cloud revenue, while Oracle emphasizes the timing of revenue recognition aligned with service delivery, affecting how each company's financial performance reflects cloud adoption."

      "question": "How does Microsoft account for hardware revenue when it is sold together with software licenses that are highly interdependent, and how does this differ from Oracle's reporting of hardware-related revenue as a separate category?",
      "answer": "Microsoft accounts for hardware revenue as a single performance obligation when it is sold together with software licenses that are highly interdependent, recognizing revenue at the point in time when ownership is transferred. In contrast, Oracle reports hardware revenue as a distinct category with a disclosed amount of $3,000 million, suggesting it is treated separately within Oracle\u2019s financial reporting framework. This indicates differing revenue recognition approaches for hardware between the two companies, with Microsoft integrating hardware and software in a single obligation while Oracle accounts for hardware as a standalone offering.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From Microsoft's filing, we learn that hardware revenue is generally recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or end customers if the hardware is highly dependent on and interrelated with the underlying operating system software.",
        "Step 2: From Oracle's filing, we observe that hardware revenue is explicitly listed as a separate category with a value of $3,000 million, indicating it is accounted for distinctly.",

In contrast, Microsoft recognizes hardware revenue at the point of sale when it is transferred to resellers or end customers, particularly because its hardware is tightly integrated with its operating system and cannot function independently.

Our cost of revenues headcount increased by seven percent during fiscal 2025, primarily in lower cost regions. Cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues during fiscal 2025 decreased by two percent from the same period a year ago primarily due to our total revenues growth outpacing our cost of revenues growth.\n\nWe intend to continue to invest additional resources in enterprise cloud computing services to allow us to scale with our customers and continue to evolve our security measures. The timing of these expenses, which also includes the use of AI and agents, may cause our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues to fluctuate over time due to changes in demand for our service offerings.\n\n## Operating Expenses\n\n",

These increases were partially offset by certain purchased intangible assets that became fully amortized. The impairment charges were primarily due to declines in estimated fair value resulting from reductions in or the elimination of expected future cash flows associated with certain of our IPR&amp;D intangible assets.\n\n## Restructuring and Other Charges\n\nWe recognized total restructuring and other charges, included in operating expenses, of $789 million and $531 million in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we announced a restructuring plan in order to allow us to invest in key growth opportunities and drive more efficiencies in our business. This restructuring plan is expected to impact approximately 7% of our global workforce. The total pre-tax charges are estimated to be up to $1 billion. We expect this plan to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2025.\n\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we initiated a restructuring plan in order to realign the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas, of which approximately 5% of our global workforce would be impacted. In connection with this plan, we incurred charges of $654 million for fiscal 2024 and the plan is substantially complete.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, we announced a restructuring plan in order to rebalance the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas. We incurred cumulative charges of $670 million and completed this plan in fiscal 2024.\n\nWe expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from these restructuring plans in our key priority areas and key growth opportunities. As a result, the overall cost savings from these restructuring plans are not expected to be material for future periods.",

      "answer": "Salesforce's Purchased Intangible Assets decreased by $380 million from $1,899 million in fiscal 2024 to $1,519 million in fiscal 2025. Cisco's accounting policy states that when an IPR&D project is completed, it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortized over its estimated useful life. This means that if Salesforce had completed IPR&D projects during this period, those assets would have transitioned from indefinite-lived to finite-lived intangibles, subject to amortization. Therefore, the $380 million decrease in Salesforce's Purchased Intangible Assets could be interpreted as consistent with industry-standard accounting practices like Cisco's, where completed projects enter amortization, reducing the balance of indefinite-lived intangible assets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From Salesforce's 10-K, extract the Purchased Intangible Assets values: $1,899 million in fiscal 2024 and $1,519 million in fiscal 2025. The difference is a $380 million decrease.",
        "Step 2: From Cisco's 10-K, extract the accounting treatment for completed IPR&D projects: upon completion, they are reclassified as amortizable purchased intangible assets and amortized over their useful life.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the two pieces of information: Salesforce\u2019s $380 million drop in Purchased Intangible Assets could reflect the reclassification and amortization of previously capitalized IPR&D assets, aligning with Cisco\u2019s described accounting practice."

The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. IPR&amp;D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When an IPR&amp;D project is completed, the IPR&amp;D is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortized over the asset's estimated useful life. Acquisition-related ex penses and related restructuring costs are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\n\n(k) G oodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets   G oodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and, when specific circumstances dictate, between annual tests. When impaired, the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value. Identifying a potential impairment consists of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. Purchased intangible assets with finite lives are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. See 'Long-Lived Assets' for our policy regarding impairment testing of purchased intangible assets with finite lives. Purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives are assessed for potential impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts might be impaired.\n\n(l) Long-Lived Assets   Long-lived assets that are held and used by us are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability of long-lived assets is based on an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.\n\n(m) Fair V alue   Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be either recorded or disclosed at fair value, we consider the principal or most",

      "answer": "AVGO disclosed that delays in the manufacture and delivery of its products could cause delays in a customer's end-product delivery, which may result in contractual compensation requirements and a loss of, or delay in, market acceptance of the affected products. This directly impacts AVGO's ability to retain customers. IBM, on the other hand, stated that if it fails to adequately and timely anticipate and respond to changes in customer and market preferences, competitive actions, or disruptive technologies, client demand for its products or services may decline, which would negatively affect customer retention. Both companies identify a direct link between operational or strategic shortcomings and potential customer retention issues, though through different mechanisms.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From AVGO's 10-K filing, it is stated that delays in product delivery could lead to customer compensation clauses being triggered and delays in market acceptance, both of which harm customer retention.",
        "Step 2: From IBM's 10-K filing, it is noted that failure to anticipate and respond to customer and market preferences, competitive actions, or disruptive technologies could lead to declining client demand, which impacts customer retention.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize that both AVGO and IBM identify risks to customer retention, but through distinct mechanisms\u2014AVGO through product delivery delays and IBM through strategic misalignment with market needs."

As a result, if there is system-wide failure or an actual or perceived breach of information integrity, security or availability occurs in one of our end-user customer's system, it can be difficult to determine which product is at fault and we could ultimately be harmed by the failure of another supplier's product. Consequently, our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers. To resolve these problems, we may have to invest significant capital and other resources and we would likely lose, or experience a delay in, market acceptance of the affected product or products. These problems may also result in claims against us by our customers or others. For example, if a delay in the manufacture and delivery of our products causes the delay of a customer's end-product delivery, we may be required, under the terms of our agreement with that customer, to compensate the customer for the adverse effects of such delays. As a result, our financial results could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## We make substantial investments in research and development and unsuccessful investments could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, changes in customer requirements, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, short product cycles and evolving industry standards, and new delivery methods. In addition, semiconductor products transition over time to increasingly smaller line width geometries and failure to successfully transition to smaller geometry process technologies could impair our competitive position. In order to remain competitive, we have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments in research and development. If we fail to develop new and enhanced products and technologies, if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted, or if new competitive technologies that we do not support become widely accepted, demand for our products may be reduced. Increased investments in research and development or unsuccessful research and development efforts could cause our cost structure to fall out of alignment with demand for our products, which would have a negative impact on our financial results.\n\n## We collect, use, store, or otherwise process personal information, which subjects us to privacy and data security laws and contractual commitments, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such laws and commitments could harm our business.\n\nWe collect, use and store (collectively, 'process') a high volume, variety and velocity of certain personal information in connection with the operation of our business. This creates various levels of privacy risks across different parts of our business, depending on the type of personal information, the jurisdiction in question and the purpose of their processing. The personal information we process is subject to an increasing number of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and data security, as well as contractual commitments. Privacy legislation and other data protection regulations, enforcement and policy activity in this area are expanding rapidly in many jurisdictions and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment. Sectoral legislation, certification requirements and technical standards applying to certain categories of our customers, such as those is the financial services or public sector, are likely to further exacerbate this trend. The cost of complying with and implementing these privacyrelated and data governance measures could be significant as they may create additional burdensome security, business process, business record or data localization requirements. Concerns about government interference, sovereignty, expanding privacy, cyber security and data governance legislation could adversely affect our customers and our products and services, particularly in cloud computing, artificial intelligence and our own data management practices. The theft, loss or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased business and security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. Any inadvertent failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy, data governance or cyber security obligations may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, substantial fines and damages, and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.\n\n## We are subject to environmental, health and safety laws, which could increase our costs, restrict our operations and require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe are subject to a variety of domestic and international laws and regulations relating to the use, disposal, cleanup of and human exposure to hazardous materials. Compliance with environmental, health and safety requirements could, among other things, require us to modify our manufacturing processes, restrict our ability to expand our facilities, or require us to acquire pollution control equipment, all of which can be very costly. Any failure by us to comply with such requirements could result in the limitation or suspension of the manufacture of our products and could result in litigation against us and the payment of significant fines and damages by us in the event of a significant adverse judgment. In addition, complying with any cleanup or remediation obligations for which we are or become responsible could be costly and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",

If the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain customers, talent and ecosystem partners could be impacted.\n\nRisks from Investing in Growth Opportunities Could Impact the Company's Business: The company continues to invest significantly in key strategic areas to drive revenue growth and market share gains. Client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing segments. Additionally, emerging business and delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products or services. If the company does not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to changes in customer and market preferences, competitive actions, disruptive technologies, emerging business models and ecosystems, the client demand for our products or services may decline or IBM's costs may increase.\n\nIBM's Intellectual Property Portfolio May Not Prevent Competitive Offerings, and IBM May Not Be Able to Obtain Necessary Licenses: The company's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. In addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. The company's ability to protect its intellectual property could also be impacted by a lack of effective legal protections as well as changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including the ownership and protection of patents.\n\nCertain of the company's offerings incorporate or utilize open source and other third-party software licensed with limited or no warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections for IBM. Further, if open source code that IBM utilizes is no longer maintained, developed or enhanced by the relevant community of independent open source software programmers, most of whom we do not employ, we may be unable to develop new technologies, adequately enhance our existing technologies or meet customer requirements for innovation, quality and price.\n\nRisks to the Company from Acquisitions, Alliances and Dispositions Include Integration Challenges, Failure to Achieve Objectives, the Assumption of Liabilities and Higher Debt Levels: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and dispositions. Such transactions present significant challenges and risks and there can be no assurances that the company will manage such transactions successfully or that strategic opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. The related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives, anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, the failure to retain key strategic relationships of acquired companies, the failure to retain key personnel and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the businesses in such transactions, as well as the failure to close planned transactions. Such transactions may require the company to secure financing and any significant disruption or turmoil in the capital markets could have an adverse effect on IBM's ability to access the capital markets at favorable terms. From time to time, the company disposes or attempts to dispose of assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives. Any such disposition or attempted disposition is subject to risks, including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition, risks related to obtaining necessary governmental or regulatory approvals and risks related to retained liabilities not subject to the company's control.\n\nThe Company's Financial Results for Particular Periods Are Difficult to Predict: IBM's revenues and profitability are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. In addition, certain of the company's growth areas involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company's financial results. The company's financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers' businesses; for example, certain of the company's services contracts with commercial customers in regulated",

      "answer": "Intel has historically faced significant delays in achieving expected manufacturing yields for its 10nm and 7nm process technologies, which led to missed customer product design windows, increased product costs, and allowed competitors like TSMC-based firms to gain a competitive edge in performance and energy efficiency. These yield issues have directly impacted Intel\u2019s gross margin due to higher per-unit costs and underutilized capacity. NVIDIA, on the other hand, faces risks from its reliance on third-party foundries, where failure to achieve high manufacturing yields\u2014either due to issues in product design or the foundry's proprietary process technology\u2014can similarly increase costs and reduce product availability. Both companies face shared implications: lower manufacturing yields lead to higher product costs, reduced gross margins, and potential loss of market share due to delayed or uncompetitive product offerings.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Intel experienced significant delays in implementing its 10nm process and encountered a defect mode in its 7nm process, which resulted in delays and allowed competitors to gain an edge in performance and energy efficiency.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - NVIDIA faces risks from third-party foundries failing to achieve high manufacturing yields, which could increase costs and reduce product availability.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both Intel and NVIDIA face yield-related risks that directly impact gross margins and product competitiveness. Intel's internal yield issues have caused internal delays and cost increases, while NVIDIA's external dependency introduces similar risks beyond its control. Both result in higher costs, reduced margins, and potential loss of market share."

      "answer": "Intel provides concrete future amortization expense figures totaling $4,584 million across 2024-2028 and beyond, indicating significant existing intangible assets likely stemming from past acquisitions. In contrast, NVIDIA's disclosures focus on forward-looking risks related to amortization expenses that may arise from future acquisitions. This contrast suggests Intel is managing the financial impact of completed deals with measurable amortization schedules, while NVIDIA is signaling potential financial risks if future acquisitions result in intangible assets requiring amortization. Intel's approach reflects a mature acquisition integration phase, whereas NVIDIA's framing suggests ongoing strategic expansion through M&A with associated financial uncertainties.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Intel's future amortization expenses total $4,584 million across 2024-2028 and beyond, indicating substantial existing intangible assets.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - NVIDIA discusses amortization expenses as a risk factor associated with future acquisitions rather than disclosing specific figures.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The contrast reveals Intel is in a post-acquisition integration phase with quantifiable amortization commitments, while NVIDIA is in a forward-looking acquisition strategy phase with potential amortization liabilities."

      "question": "How do Intel's increased manufacturing costs due to delays in process node development and NVIDIA's increased product costs from supply chain commitments combine to reflect contrasting financial pressures in the semiconductor industry?",
      "answer": "Intel's increased manufacturing costs are primarily driven by delays in process node development, such as the 10nm and 7nm delays, which have resulted in larger die sizes, manufacturing supply constraints, and increased depreciation costs due to underutilized facilities. These delays have disproportionately affected Intel's gross margin and operating income due to its high fixed cost structure. In contrast, NVIDIA's increased product costs stem from supply chain complexities, including premiums and deposits paid to secure future supply and capacity, as well as the integration of new suppliers and components into its supply chain. These contrasting pressures highlight different financial challenges: Intel faces internal manufacturing inefficiencies, while NVIDIA grapples with external supply chain volatility.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Intel's manufacturing cost increases are linked to process node delays (e.g., 10nm and 7nm), which have caused larger die sizes, supply constraints, and underutilized facility costs.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - NVIDIA's product cost increases are due to supply chain commitments, including premiums, deposits, and integration of new suppliers.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies experience rising product costs, but from different sources: Intel from internal manufacturing challenges, NVIDIA from external supply chain pressures."

      "question": "Considering Apple's exposure to inventory write-downs due to forecast inaccuracies and NVIDIA's challenges in estimating demand for GPUs, including the impact of cryptocurrency mining volatility, what is the combined financial risk in terms of potential inventory write-downs and excess inventory costs if both companies experience a 15% over-forecasting error in component procurement?",
      "answer": "If both Apple and NVIDIA experience a 15% over-forecasting error in component procurement, Apple could face significant inventory write-downs due to its practice of ordering components up to 150 days in advance, while NVIDIA could incur costs from excess inventory tied to long manufacturing lead times (up to 12 months) and uncertain demand from cryptocurrency mining. The combined financial risk would involve Apple\u2019s inventory write-downs on excess or obsolete components and NVIDIA\u2019s potential losses from unsold or repurposed inventory, such as LHR and CMP GPUs, leading to a compounded impact on both companies' financial performance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Apple orders components for its products up to 150 days in advance based on forecasts, and if demand is overestimated, it may face inventory write-downs and purchase commitment cancellation fees.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - NVIDIA faces challenges estimating demand due to cryptocurrency mining volatility and has manufacturing lead times extending up to 12 months, increasing the risk of excess inventory and write-downs.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - A 15% over-forecasting error would result in Apple writing down inventory and NVIDIA facing unsold GPU stock (especially LHR and CMP lines), both leading to financial losses. The combined risk includes both companies\u2019 exposure to write-downs and excess inventory costs."

          "chunk_text": "The Company's new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers' yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements. When the Company's supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained,  or  when  an  outsourcing  partner  has  delayed  shipments  of  completed  products  to  the  Company,  the  Company's business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely  affect  the  Company's  business,  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition.  The  Company's  business  and  financial performance  could  also  be  materially  adversely  affected  depending  on  the  time  required  to  obtain  sufficient  quantities  from  the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\n\n## The Company's products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company's business and result in harm to the Company's reputation.\n\nThe  Company  offers  complex  hardware  and  software  products  and  services  that  can  be  affected  by  design  and  manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company's products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company's products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company's service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company's services from time to time have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues  and  defects  in  the  hardware,  software  and  services  it  offers.  Failure  to  do  so  can  result  in  widespread  technical  and performance issues affecting the Company's products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims,  recalls,  product  replacements  or  modifications,  write-offs  of  inventory,  property,  plant  and  equipment,  and/or  intangible assets,  and  significant  warranty  and  other  expenses,  including  litigation  costs  and  regulatory  fines.  Quality  problems  can  also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company's products and services, and result in harm to the Company's reputation, loss  of  competitive  advantage,  poor  market  acceptance,  reduced  demand  for  products  and  services,  delay  in  new  product  and service introductions and lost sales.\n\n## The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.\n\nThe  Company  records  a  write-down  for  product  and  component  inventories  that  have  become  obsolete  or  exceed  anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers' facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the  asset  exceeds  its  fair  value.  Although  the  Company  believes  its  inventory,  capital  assets,  inventory  prepayments  and  other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.\n\nThe  Company  orders  components  for  its  products  and  builds  inventory  in  advance  of  product  announcements  and  shipments. Manufacturing  purchase  obligations  cover  the  Company's  forecasted  component  and  manufacturing  requirements,  typically  for periods  up  to  150  days.  Because  the  Company's  markets  are  volatile,  competitive  and  subject  to  rapid  technology  and  price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\n\n## The  Company  relies  on  access  to  third-party  intellectual  property,  which  may  not  be  available  to  the  Company  on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\n\nThe Company's products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in  the  future  may  compete,  current  extensive  patent  coverage  and  the  rapid  rate  of  issuance  of  new  patents,  the  Company's products  and  services  can  unknowingly  infringe  existing  patents  or  intellectual  property  rights  of  others.  From  time  to  time,  the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.",

          "chunk_text": "## Competition in our current and target markets could prevent us from growing our revenue.\n\nOur  target  markets  remain  competitive,  and  competition  may  intensify  with  expanding  and  changing  product  and service  offerings,  industry  standards,  customer  needs,  new  entrants  and  consolidations.  Our  competitors'  products, services and technologies, such as the high-end discrete GPUs offered by Intel and AMD, may be cheaper or provide better functionality or features than ours, which may result in lower than expected selling prices for our products. Some of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities, have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive IP portfolios and patent protections, new designs and more design wins, and greater financial, sales, marketing  and  distribution  resources  than  we  do.  These  competitors  may  be  able  to  more  effectively  identify  and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends, more quickly transition their products, and secure sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials during a supply-constrained environment, which could harm our business. In our networking business, some of our customers are also integrated circuit and switch suppliers and have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities similar to ours. Licensing our technology and supporting such  customers  entails  the  transfer  of  IP  rights  that  may  enable  such  customers  to  develop  their  own  solutions  to replace those we are providing. If we are unable to successfully compete and respond to changes in our target markets or introduce new offerings to meet the needs of this competitive environment, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease, which would cause our revenue to decline.\n\n## Risks Related to Demand, Supply and Manufacturing\n\n## If we fail to estimate customer demand properly, there may be a mismatch between supply and demand, and our financial results could be harmed.\n\nDemand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions and transitions, time to market, competitor product releases and announcements, competing technologies, and other factors, all of which can impact the timing and volume of our revenue. We sell many of our products through channel partners, who sell to retailers, distributors, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions made by our channel partners, retailers and distributors in response  to  changing  market  conditions  and  demand  for  our  products  could  impact  our  ability  to  properly  forecast demand.\n\nGPUs  have  use  cases  in  addition  to  their  designed  and  marketed  use  case,  such  as  for  digital  currency  mining, including blockchain-based platforms such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards, and changes in the method of verifying blockchain transactions, have impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand  for  our  products,  and  can  further  impact  our  ability  to  estimate  demand  for  our  products.  Changes  to cryptocurrency  standards  and  processes  including,  but  not  limited  to,  the  pending  Ethereum  2.0  standard  may decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining as well as create increased aftermarket resales of our GPUs, impact retail prices for our GPUs, increase returns of our products in the distribution channel, and may reduce demand for our new GPUs. We have introduced Lite Hash Rate, or LHR, GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability and increased  the  supply  of  CMP  in  an  effort  to  address  demand  from  gamers  and  direct  miners  to  CMP.  However,  if attempts in the aftermarket to improve the hash rate capabilities of our LHR cards are successful, our gaming cards may become more attractive to miners, increasing demand for our gaming GPUs and limiting our ability to supply our gaming cards to  non-mining  customers.  We  cannot  predict  whether  our  strategy  of  using  LHR  cards  and  CMP  will achieve our desired outcome. In addition, our products may be resold on the unauthorized 'gray market,' which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products compete with our distribution channels.\n\nConsumer and enterprise behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased demand for our Gaming, Data Center, and workstation products, has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand. These challenges may continue in the future when the effects of the pandemic subside.\n\nOur manufacturing lead times are very long and in some cases, extend to be twelve months or longer, which requires us to make estimates of customers' future demand. We have revised our process for purchasing supply as a result of the worldwide supply shortages impacting the semiconductor industry. Our inventory and purchase commitments reflect our demand expectations for our future quarters and long-term supply and capacity needs. These conditions could lead to a significant mismatch between supply and demand, giving rise to product shortages or excess inventory. Demand for  our  products  may  be  perishable  or  may  disappear,  which  would  make our demand forecast more uncertain and cause us to lose market share, perhaps permanently. To shorten shipment lead times, we may build finished products and carry  inventory  for  anticipated  demand  that  does  not  materialize.  We  may  not  be  able  to  reduce  our  inventory purchase commitments if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors. We may writedown our",

          "chunk_text": "## Manufacturing Purchase Obligations\n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company's products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual  suppliers.  Outsourcing  partners  acquire  components  and  build  product  based  on  demand  information  supplied  by  the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations  of  $71.1  billion,  with  $68.4  billion  payable  within  12  months.  The  Company's  manufacturing  purchase  obligations  are primarily noncancelable.\n\n## Other Purchase Obligations\n\nThe Company's other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related  to  product  manufacturing,  and  noncancelable  obligations  related  to  internet  services  and  content  creation.  As  of September 24, 2022, the Company had other purchase obligations of $17.8 billion, with $6.8 billion payable within 12 months.\n\n## Deemed Repatriation Tax Payable\n\nAs of September 24, 2022, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the 'Act') was $22.0 billion, with $5.3 billion expected to be paid within 12 months.\n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has a capital return program authorized by the Board of Directors. The Program  does  not  obligate  the  Company  to  acquire  a  minimum  amount  of  shares.  As  of  September  24,  2022,  the  Company's quarterly  cash  dividend  was  $0.23  per  share.  The  Company  intends  to  increase  its  dividend  on  an  annual  basis,  subject  to declaration by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial  statements  and  related  disclosures  in  conformity  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles ('GAAP')  and  the  Company's  discussion  and  analysis  of  its  financial  condition  and  operating  results  require  the  Company's management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies' of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\n\n## Uncertain Tax Positions\n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company's uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company's reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different  from  that  which  is  reflected  in  the  Company's  reserves.  Reserves  are  adjusted  considering  changing  facts  and circumstances,  such  as  the  closing  of  a  tax  examination.  Resolution  of  these  uncertainties  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with management's expectations could have a material impact on the Company's financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Legal and Other Contingencies\n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are  inherently  uncertain.  The  Company  records  a  liability  when  it  is  probable  that  a  loss  has  been  incurred  and  the  amount  is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations could have a material impact on the Company's financial condition and operating results.",

          "chunk_text": "## The Company's financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.\n\nThe Company's primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar-denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company's products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects  the  U.S.  dollar  value  of  the  Company's  foreign currency-denominated  sales  and  earnings,  and  generally  leads  the  Company  to  raise  international  pricing,  potentially  reducing demand for the Company's products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar's strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency-denominated sales.\n\nConversely,  a  strengthening  of  foreign  currencies  relative  to  the  U.S.  dollar,  while  generally  beneficial  to  the  Company's  foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency  derivative  instruments,  thereby  limiting  the  benefit.  Additionally,  strengthening  of  foreign  currencies  may  increase  the Company's cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\n\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\n\n## The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\n\nThe Company's investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\n\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and  resellers.  The  Company  also  sells  its  products  and  services  directly  to  small  and  mid-sized  businesses  and  education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company's outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company's trade receivables  can  be  concentrated  within  cellular  network  carriers  or  other  resellers.  The  Company's  exposure  to  credit  and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 24, 2022, the Company's vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade  and  vendor  non-trade  receivables,  as  well  as  long-term  prepayments,  there  can  be  no  assurance  such  procedures  will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\n\n## The Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.\n\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company's subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company's effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix  of  earnings  in  countries  with  differing  statutory  tax  rates,  changes  in  the  valuation  of  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities,  the introduction of new taxes, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations.\n\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 16",

      "question": "What was Apple's net cash outflow from purchases of marketable securities in fiscal year 2022, and how does this compare to the change in NVIDIA's marketable securities position, considering NVIDIA's description of higher purchases during the same period?",
      "answer": "Apple's net cash outflow from purchases of marketable securities in fiscal year 2022 was $76.923 billion. NVIDIA described 'higher purchases of marketable securities' in fiscal year 2022, which led to a decrease in cash provided by investing activities, despite also having higher sales and maturities of marketable securities. However, NVIDIA does not disclose an exact figure for its purchases, so a direct numerical comparison between Apple's $76.923 billion and NVIDIA's increase in purchases cannot be quantitatively determined from the provided data. We can only infer that both companies were active in purchasing marketable securities, but the extent of NVIDIA's purchases relative to Apple's cannot be calculated from the given evidence.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From Apple's 10-K filing, we extract that the company's purchases of marketable securities in fiscal year 2022 were $76,923 million.",
        "Step 2: From NVIDIA's 10-K filing, we extract that the company experienced 'higher purchases of marketable securities' in fiscal year 2022, but no exact dollar amount is provided.",
        "Step 3: We compare the two disclosures and conclude that while Apple's exact outflow is known, NVIDIA's increase in purchases is described qualitatively, not quantitatively, so a definitive numerical comparison cannot be made."

Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and credit exposures, and certain maturity limits on our portfolio.\n\nCash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021, due to higher net income, partially offset by changes in working capital. Changes in working capital were primarily driven by prepayments of $1.87 billion for long-term supply agreements and increases in trade receivables due to higher revenue.\n\nCash used in investing activities decreased in fiscal year 2022 compared to cash provided in fiscal year 2021, reflecting lower payments in acquiring businesses as compared to the acquisition of Mellanox in fiscal year 2021, and higher marketable securities sales and maturities, partially offset by higher purchases of marketable securities.\n\nCash provided by financing activities decreased in fiscal year 2022 compared to cash provided in fiscal year 2021, which primarily reflects a debt repayment in the fiscal year 2022 and higher tax payments on restricted stock units.\n\n## Liquidity\n\nOur primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. As of January 30, 2022, we had $21.21 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months, and for the foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations and additional supply. We continuously evaluate our liquidity  and  capital  resources,  including  our  access  to  external  capital,  to  ensure  we  can  finance  our  future  capital requirements.\n\nOur marketable securities consist of certificates of deposits and debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies,  highly  rated  corporations  and  financial  institutions,  and  foreign  government  entities.  These  marketable securities  are  primarily  denominated  in  U.S.  dollars.  Refer  to  Note  8  of  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\nDuring fiscal year 2023, we expect to use our existing cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations to fund our capital investments of approximately $1.4 billion related to property and equipment.\n\nWe have approximately $1.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued any related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S. Other than that, substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the U.S. as of January 30, 2022 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes.

      "answer": "Apple explicitly states that as a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar, a stronger U.S. dollar could negatively affect its net sales and gross margins when expressed in U.S. dollars due to competitive pressures in local markets. This exposes Apple to foreign exchange risk that could directly compress gross margins unless mitigated through pricing adjustments or hedging strategies. In contrast, Intel includes gross margin projections as part of its forward-looking statements, indicating that it actively manages and guides expectations around gross margins through strategic initiatives, manufacturing expansion, and internal/external production planning. While Apple focuses on hedging and risk management to counter external currency pressures, Intel emphasizes proactive business and manufacturing strategies to influence gross margin outcomes directly. Together, these approaches highlight how two technology companies address gross margin stability through different lenses: Apple by mitigating external financial risks and Intel by shaping internal operational and strategic levers.",

          "chunk_text": "## Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\n## Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management\n\nThe Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone basis  and  in  conjunction  with  its  underlying  foreign  currency  and  interest  rate  exposures.  Given  the  effective  horizons  of  the Company's risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company's financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nThe Company's exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company's investment portfolio and outstanding debt. While the Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, it is most affected by fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in  U.S.  interest  rates  affect  the  interest  earned  on  the  Company's  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  marketable  securities  and  the  fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company's debt.\n\nThe Company's investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the Company's liquidity requirements.  The  Company  uses  a  combination  of  internal  and  external  management  to  execute  its  investment  strategy  and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company's investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company's investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $4.0 billion and $4.1 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.\n\nAs  of  September  24,  2022,  the  Company  had  outstanding  fixed-rate  notes  and  as  of  September  25,  2021,  the  Company  had outstanding  floating-  and  fixed-rate  notes  with  varying  maturities  for  an  aggregate  carrying  amount  of  $110.1  billion  and  $118.7 billion, respectively. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its  outstanding  term  debt.  Interest  rate  swaps  allow  the  Company  to  effectively  convert  fixed-rate  payments  into  floating-rate payments  or  floating-rate  payments  into  fixed-rate  payments.  Gains  and  losses  on  term  debt  are  generally  offset  by  the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company's debt as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021 to increase by $201 million and $186 million on an annualized basis, respectively.\n\n## Foreign Currency Risk\n\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company's net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nThe  Company  may  enter  into  foreign  currency  forward  and  option  contracts  with  financial  institutions  to  protect  against  foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency  contracts  to  partially  offset  the  foreign  currency  exchange  gains  and  losses  on  its  foreign  currency-denominated  debt issuances.  The  Company  generally  hedges  portions  of  its  forecasted  foreign  currency  exposure  associated  with  revenue  and inventory  purchases,  typically  for  up  to  12  months.  However,  the  Company  may  choose  not  to  hedge  certain  foreign  exchange exposures  for  a  variety  of  reasons,  including  accounting  considerations  or  the  prohibitive  economic  cost  of  hedging  particular exposures.\n\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 26",

While Apple's financial planning must account for FX volatility through hedging instruments and pricing adjustments, Intel's planning focuses on absorbing upfront costs of long-term strategic investments that are expected to drive future revenue growth and margin improvement.

Changes in  U.S.  interest  rates  affect  the  interest  earned  on  the  Company's  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  marketable  securities  and  the  fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company's debt.\n\nThe Company's investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the Company's liquidity requirements.  The  Company  uses  a  combination  of  internal  and  external  management  to  execute  its  investment  strategy  and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company's investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company's investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $4.0 billion and $4.1 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.\n\nAs  of  September  24,  2022,  the  Company  had  outstanding  fixed-rate  notes  and  as  of  September  25,  2021,  the  Company  had outstanding  floating-  and  fixed-rate  notes  with  varying  maturities  for  an  aggregate  carrying  amount  of  $110.1  billion  and  $118.7 billion, respectively. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its  outstanding  term  debt.  Interest  rate  swaps  allow  the  Company  to  effectively  convert  fixed-rate  payments  into  floating-rate payments  or  floating-rate  payments  into  fixed-rate  payments.  Gains  and  losses  on  term  debt  are  generally  offset  by  the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company's debt as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021 to increase by $201 million and $186 million on an annualized basis, respectively.\n\n## Foreign Currency Risk\n\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company's net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nThe  Company  may  enter  into  foreign  currency  forward  and  option  contracts  with  financial  institutions  to  protect  against  foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency  contracts  to  partially  offset  the  foreign  currency  exchange  gains  and  losses  on  its  foreign  currency-denominated  debt issuances.  The  Company  generally  hedges  portions  of  its  forecasted  foreign  currency  exposure  associated  with  revenue  and inventory  purchases,  typically  for  up  to  12  months.  However,  the  Company  may  choose  not  to  hedge  certain  foreign  exchange exposures  for  a  variety  of  reasons,  including  accounting  considerations  or  the  prohibitive  economic  cost  of  hedging  particular exposures.\n\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 26",

          "chunk_text": "## The Company's financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.\n\nThe Company's primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar-denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company's products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects  the  U.S.  dollar  value  of  the  Company's  foreign currency-denominated  sales  and  earnings,  and  generally  leads  the  Company  to  raise  international  pricing,  potentially  reducing demand for the Company's products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar's strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency-denominated sales.\n\nConversely,  a  strengthening  of  foreign  currencies  relative  to  the  U.S.  dollar,  while  generally  beneficial  to  the  Company's  foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency  derivative  instruments,  thereby  limiting  the  benefit.  Additionally,  strengthening  of  foreign  currencies  may  increase  the Company's cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\n\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\n\n## The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\n\nThe Company's investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\n\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and  resellers.  The  Company  also  sells  its  products  and  services  directly  to  small  and  mid-sized  businesses  and  education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company's outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company's trade receivables  can  be  concentrated  within  cellular  network  carriers  or  other  resellers.  The  Company's  exposure  to  credit  and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 24, 2022, the Company's vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade  and  vendor  non-trade  receivables,  as  well  as  long-term  prepayments,  there  can  be  no  assurance  such  procedures  will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\n\n## The Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.\n\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company's subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company's effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix  of  earnings  in  countries  with  differing  statutory  tax  rates,  changes  in  the  valuation  of  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities,  the introduction of new taxes, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations.\n\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 16",

IBM treats write-offs as reductions in allowances when amounts are deemed unrecoverable, and additions or deductions reflect changes in estimates of unrecoverable amounts, which are recorded to expense accounts.

Accenture returned $6.6 billion through share purchases of $4.1 billion and dividends of $2.5 billion, while Microsoft returned $12.4 billion in the fourth quarter alone through share repurchases and dividends.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis also contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in 'Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements' and 'Risk Factors' in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nWe use the terms 'Accenture,' 'we,' the 'Company,' 'our' and 'us' in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to 'fiscal 2022' means the 12-month period that ended on August 31, 2022. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.\n\nWe use the term 'in local currency' so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results 'in local currency' are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior-year period's foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.\n\n## Overview\n\nAccenture plc is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services and solutions across Strategy &amp; Consulting, Technology, Operations, Industry X and Song. We serve clients in three geographic markets: North America, Europe and Growth Markets (Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East). We combine our strength in technology with industry experience, functional expertise and global delivery capability to help the world's leading businesses, governments and other organizations build their digital core, optimize their operations, accelerate revenue growth and enhance citizen services-creating tangible value at speed and scale.\n\nOur results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, the overall inflationary environment and levels of business confidence. There continues to be significant economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which has impacted and may continue to impact our business, particularly with regard to wage inflation and increased volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. During fiscal 2022, we disposed of our business in Russia and recorded a non-operating loss of $96 million. We do not have a business in Ukraine or Belarus.\n\n## Key Metrics\n\nWe saw very strong demand across our business in fiscal 2022 as our clients continue their digital transformations. Key metrics for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 included:\n\n- Revenues of $61.6 billion, representing 22% growth in U.S. dollars and 26% growth in local currency;\n- New bookings of $71.7 billion, an increase of 21% in U.S. dollars and 25% in local currency;\n- Operating margin of 15.2%, a 10 basis point expansion;\n- Diluted earnings per share of $10.71, an increase of 16.9% over $9.16 for fiscal 2021, including a $0.15 per share or 2% negative impact from the disposition of our business in Russia; and\n- Cash returned to shareholders of $6.6 billion, including share purchases of $4.1 billion and dividends of $2.5 billion.",

In contrast, NVIDIA discloses that it amortizes completed IPR&D assets over periods ranging from one to twenty years, using a method that reflects the pattern of economic benefits unless that pattern cannot be reliably determined, in which case a straight-line method is used. This highlights a more concrete and detailed approach by NVIDIA compared to Cisco's general disclosure.",

The  excess  of  the  fair  value  of  purchase  consideration  over  the  fair  values  of  these  identifiable  assets  and  liabilities  is recorded as goodwill. IPR&amp;D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When an IPR&amp;D project is completed, the IPR&amp;D is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset  and  amortized  over  the  asset's  estimated  useful  life.  Acquisition-related  expenses  and  related  restructuring  costs  are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\n\n(k) Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets   Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and, when specific circumstances dictate, between annual tests. When impaired, the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair  value.  Identifying  a  potential  impairment  consists  of  comparing  the  fair  value  of  a  reporting  unit  with  its  carrying  amount, including goodwill. Purchased intangible assets with finite lives are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. See 'Long-Lived Assets' for our policy regarding impairment testing of purchased intangible assets with finite lives. Purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives are assessed for potential impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts might be impaired.\n\n(l) Long-Lived Assets   Long-lived assets that are held and used by us are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability of longlived  assets  is  based  on  an  estimate  of  the  undiscounted  future  cash  flows  resulting  from  the  use  of  the  asset  and  its  eventual disposition. Measurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.",

          "chunk_text": "## NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\n## Leases\n\nWe determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months  are  included  in  operating  lease  assets,  accrued  and  other  current  liabilities,  and  long-term  operating  lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term.\n\nOperating  lease  assets  and  liabilities  are  recognized  based  on  the  present  value  of  the  remaining  lease  payments discounted using our incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nWe combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential  impairment exist. For the purposes of completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis.\n\nQualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting units.\n\nOur quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit's fair value. The income and market valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are not limited  to,  prospective  financial  information,  growth  rates,  residual  values,  discount  rates  and  comparable  multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business.\n\n## Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\n\nIntangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology, in-process research and development, or IPR&amp;D, and customer relationships, as well as rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, and acquired IP. We currently amortize our intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from one to twenty years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise  used  up  or,  if  that  pattern  cannot  be  reliably  determined,  using  a  straight-line  amortization  method.  We initially  capitalize  the  fair  value  of  IPR&amp;D  as  an  intangible  asset  with  an  indefinite  life.  When  IPR&amp;D  projects  are completed,  we  reclassify  the  IPR&amp;D  as  an  amortizable  purchased  intangible  asset  and  amortize  over  the  asset's estimated useful life.\n\nLong-lived  assets,  such  as  property  and  equipment  and  intangible  assets  subject  to  amortization,  are  reviewed  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated.\n\n## Business Combination\n\nWe allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, including IPR&amp;D, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions  are  inherently  uncertain  and  subject  to  refinement.  The  estimates  and  assumptions  used  in  valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, discount rate used",

        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - CSCO's Ending Balance of Deferred Tax Liabilities was $3,106 million in fiscal year 2021 and decreased to $3,101 million in fiscal year 2022.",

This guidance provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits.\n\nNet income per share. Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stock by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stock by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted shares outstanding include the dilutive effect of unvested RSUs, in-the-money stock options, and ESPP rights (together referred to as 'equity awards'), as well as convertible preferred stock. Potentially dilutive shares whose effect would have been antidilutive are excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share.\n\nThe dilutive effect of equity awards is calculated based on the average stock price for each fiscal period, using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options and purchasing shares under the ESPP and the amount of compensation cost for future service that we have not yet recognized are collectively assumed to be used to repurchase shares. The dilutive effect of convertible preferred stock is calculated using the if-converted method. The if-converted method assumes that these securities were converted at the beginning of the reporting period to the extent that the effect is dilutive.\n\nRecently Adopted Accounting Guidance. In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ('ASU') 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers . The new guidance requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , as if it had originated the contracts. We early adopted this guidance at the beginning of fiscal year 2022 and it did not materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 3. Revenue from Contracts with Customers\n\n## Disaggregation\n\nWe have considered (1) information that is regularly reviewed by our Chief Executive Officer, who has been identified as the chief operating decision maker (the 'CODM') as defined by the authoritative guidance on segment reporting, in evaluating financial performance and (2) disclosures presented outside of our financial statements in our earnings releases and used in investor presentations to disaggregate revenues. The principal category we use to disaggregate revenues is the nature of our products and subscriptions and services, as presented in our consolidated statements of operations.

      "answer": "Apple explicitly quantifies its right-of-use (ROU) assets in its 2022 financial statements, reporting $10,417 million for operating leases and $952 million for finance leases, totaling $11,369 million. In contrast, while AMD discloses its policy to record ROU assets and lease liabilities for both operating and finance leases, it does not provide specific dollar amounts for its ROU assets in the provided excerpt. This reveals that Apple offers greater quantitative transparency regarding its lease obligations, whereas AMD's disclosure is primarily qualitative and policy-focused. The difference highlights varying levels of detail in lease accounting disclosures between the two companies, which could impact investor understanding of their balance sheet strength and lease-related risks.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Apple's 2022 10-K quantifies right-of-use assets at $10,417 million for operating leases and $952 million for finance leases.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - AMD's 2022 10-K explains its lease accounting policy, stating that operating and finance leases are recorded as ROU assets and lease liabilities, but does not disclose specific dollar amounts for these assets.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Comparing the two reveals that Apple provides detailed, quantitative disclosure of its ROU assets, while AMD only describes its accounting approach without specific figures, indicating a difference in disclosure transparency."

          "chunk_text": "## Investments in Available-for-sale Debt Securities\n\nThe Company classifies its investments in debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. Available-forsale  debt  securities  are  reported  at  fair  value  with  the  related  unrealized  gains  and  losses  included,  net  of  tax,  in accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  (loss),  a  component  of  stockholders'  equity.  If  an  available-for-sale  debt security's fair value is less than its amortized cost basis, then the Company evaluates whether the decline is the result of a credit loss, in which case an impairment is recorded through an allowance for credit losses. Unrealized gains and losses not attributable to credit losses are included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders' equity. The cost of securities sold is determined based on the specific identification method.\n\n## Property and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated  useful  lives  of  the  assets.  Estimated  useful  lives  of  equipment  is  two  to  six  years,  and  leasehold improvements are measured by the shorter of the remaining terms of the leases or the estimated useful economic lives of the improvements.\n\n## Leases\n\nOperating and finance leases are recorded as right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities on the Company's balance sheet. ROU assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating and finance lease ROU assets  and  liabilities  are  initially  recognized  based  on  the  present  value  of  lease  payments  over  the  lease  term.  In determining the present value of lease payments, the Company uses the implicit interest rate if readily determinable. When the implicit interest rate is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, which is based on its collateralized borrowing capabilities over a similar term of the lease payments. The Company utilizes the consolidated  group  incremental  borrowing  rate  for  all  leases  as  the  Company  has  centralized  treasury  operations. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has  elected  the  accounting  policy  to  not  recognize  ROU  assets  and  lease  liabilities  that  arise  from  short-term  (12 months or less) leases for any class of underlying asset. Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The Company's finance leases are immaterial.\n\n## Foreign Currency Translation/Transactions\n\nThe  functional  currency  of  all  of  the  Company's  foreign  subsidiaries  is  the  U.S.  dollar.  Assets  and  liabilities denominated  in  non-U.S.  dollars  have  been  remeasured  into  U.S.  dollars  at  current  exchange  rates  for  monetary assets and liabilities and historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets and liabilities. Non-U.S. dollar denominated transactions have been remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those cost of sales  and  expense  transactions  related  to  non-monetary  balance  sheet  amounts  which  have  been  remeasured  at historical exchange rates. The gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings.\n\n## Marketing and Advertising Expenses\n\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. In addition, the Company's marketing and advertising expenses include certain cooperative advertising funding obligations under customer incentive programs, which costs are recorded upon agreement with customers and vendor partners. Cooperative advertising expenses are recorded as marketing, general and administrative expense to the extent the cash paid does not exceed the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received. Any excess of cash paid over the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received is recorded as  a  reduction  of  revenue.  Total  marketing  and  advertising  expenses  for  2021,  2020  and  2019  were  approximately $578 million, $314 million and $217 million, respectively.",

      "question": "Considering the impact of excess inventory risks on both Apple and AMD, how might a decrease in customer demand affect both companies' financial positions given their respective commitments to suppliers and manufacturing processes?",
      "answer": "A decrease in customer demand could result in excess inventory for both Apple and AMD, leading to financial risks such as write-downs, increased production costs, and unutilized purchase commitments. Apple orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments, with manufacturing purchase obligations covering forecasted requirements for up to 150 days. If demand decreases, Apple risks forecasting incorrectly and producing excess components or products, which could lead to inventory write-downs and unutilized purchase commitments. Similarly, AMD has prepayment arrangements with certain vendors, and a decrease in customer demand could result in excess inventory and increased production costs. AMD's reliance on long-term purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements makes it particularly vulnerable to financial strain if demand decreases and inventory cannot be utilized. Together, these dynamics show how both companies' financial positions could be adversely impacted by a shared risk of excess inventory stemming from mismatched supply and demand.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Apple builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments, with manufacturing purchase obligations covering forecasted requirements for up to 150 days. Incorrect forecasting could lead to excess inventory and unutilized purchase commitments.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - AMD has prepayment arrangements with vendors, and a decrease in customer demand could result in excess inventory and increased production costs, particularly due to its reliance on long-term purchase commitments.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both Apple and AMD face financial risks from excess inventory due to a decrease in customer demand. Apple's exposure comes from its forecasting and manufacturing obligations, while AMD's exposure stems from prepayment arrangements and purchase commitments. Both companies could face inventory write-downs and increased costs, impacting their financial positions."

          "chunk_text": "The Company's new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers' yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements. When the Company's supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained,  or  when  an  outsourcing  partner  has  delayed  shipments  of  completed  products  to  the  Company,  the  Company's business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely  affect  the  Company's  business,  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition.  The  Company's  business  and  financial performance  could  also  be  materially  adversely  affected  depending  on  the  time  required  to  obtain  sufficient  quantities  from  the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\n\n## The Company's products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company's business and result in harm to the Company's reputation.\n\nThe  Company  offers  complex  hardware  and  software  products  and  services  that  can  be  affected  by  design  and  manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company's products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company's products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company's service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company's services from time to time have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues  and  defects  in  the  hardware,  software  and  services  it  offers.  Failure  to  do  so  can  result  in  widespread  technical  and performance issues affecting the Company's products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims,  recalls,  product  replacements  or  modifications,  write-offs  of  inventory,  property,  plant  and  equipment,  and/or  intangible assets,  and  significant  warranty  and  other  expenses,  including  litigation  costs  and  regulatory  fines.  Quality  problems  can  also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company's products and services, and result in harm to the Company's reputation, loss  of  competitive  advantage,  poor  market  acceptance,  reduced  demand  for  products  and  services,  delay  in  new  product  and service introductions and lost sales.\n\n## The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.\n\nThe  Company  records  a  write-down  for  product  and  component  inventories  that  have  become  obsolete  or  exceed  anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers' facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the  asset  exceeds  its  fair  value.  Although  the  Company  believes  its  inventory,  capital  assets,  inventory  prepayments  and  other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.\n\nThe  Company  orders  components  for  its  products  and  builds  inventory  in  advance  of  product  announcements  and  shipments. Manufacturing  purchase  obligations  cover  the  Company's  forecasted  component  and  manufacturing  requirements,  typically  for periods  up  to  150  days.  Because  the  Company's  markets  are  volatile,  competitive  and  subject  to  rapid  technology  and  price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\n\n## The  Company  relies  on  access  to  third-party  intellectual  property,  which  may  not  be  available  to  the  Company  on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\n\nThe Company's products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in  the  future  may  compete,  current  extensive  patent  coverage  and  the  rapid  rate  of  issuance  of  new  patents,  the  Company's products  and  services  can  unknowingly  infringe  existing  patents  or  intellectual  property  rights  of  others.  From  time  to  time,  the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.",

Our third-party suppliers also depend on the same timely delivery of adequate quantities of equipment and materials in the manufacture of our products. In addition, as many of our products increase in technical complexity, we rely on our third-party suppliers to update their processes in order to continue meeting our back-end manufacturing needs. Certain equipment and materials that are used in the manufacture of our products are available only from a limited number of suppliers, or in some cases, a sole supplier. We also depend on a limited number of suppliers to provide the majority of certain types of integrated circuit packages for our microprocessors, including our APU  products.  Similarly,  certain  non-proprietary  materials  or  components  such  as  memory,  printed  circuit  boards (PCBs), interposers, substrates and capacitors used in the manufacture of our products are currently available from only a limited number of sources. If we are unable to procure a stable supply of equipment, materials or substrates on an ongoing basis and at reasonable costs to meet our production requirements, we could experience a shortage in equipment, materials or substrate supply or an increase in production costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have long-term purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements with some of our vendors. If  the  delivery  of  such  supply  is  delayed  or  does  not  occur  for  any  reason,  it  could  materially  impact  our  ability  to procure and process the required volume of supply to meet customer demand. Conversely, a decrease in customer demand  could  result  in  excess  inventory  and  an  increase  in  our  production  costs,  particularly  since  we  have prepayment arrangements with certain vendors. Because some of the equipment and materials that we and our thirdparty  manufacturing  suppliers  purchase  are  complex,  it  is  sometimes  difficult  to  substitute  one  supplier  for  another. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors.  Also,  some  of  these  materials  and  components  may  be  subject  to  rapid  changes  in  price  and  availability. Interruption  of  supply  or  increased  demand  in  the  industry  could  cause  shortages  and  price  increases  in  various essential materials. Dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers exacerbates these risks. If we are unable to procure certain of these materials for our back-end manufacturing operations, or our third-party foundries or manufacturing  suppliers  are  unable  to  procure  materials  for  manufacturing  our  products,  our  business  would  be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Failure  to  achieve  expected  manufacturing  yields  for  our  products  could  negatively  impact  our  financial results.\n\nSemiconductor  manufacturing  yields  are  a  result  of  both  product  design  and  process  technology,  which  is  typically proprietary  to  the  manufacturer,  and  low  yields  can  result  from  design  failures,  process  technology  failures  or  a combination of both. Our third-party foundries are responsible for the process technologies used to fabricate silicon wafers. If our third-party foundries experience manufacturing inefficiencies or encounter disruptions, errors or difficulties during  production,  we  may  fail  to  achieve  acceptable  yields  or  experience  product  delivery  delays.  We  cannot  be certain that our third-party foundries will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement leading-edge process technologies  needed  to  manufacture  future  generations  of  our  products  profitably  or  on  a  timely  basis  or  that  our competitors will not develop new technologies, products or processes earlier. Moreover, during periods when foundries are  implementing new process technologies, their manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive. A substantial delay  in  the  technology  transitions  to  smaller  process  technologies  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  us, particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies before us. For example, we are presently focusing our 7 nm and lower product portfolio on TSMC's processes. If TSMC is not able to manufacture wafers for our products at 7nm or smaller nodes in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nAny decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in per unit costs, which would adversely impact our gross margin and/or force us to allocate our reduced product supply amongst our customers, which could harm our relationships and reputation with our customers and materially adversely affect our business.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nintroduced certain international provisions applicable to us. Among other considerations, the applicability and impact of these tax provisions, and of other U.S. or international tax law changes could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and cash flows in future years.\n\nOur income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to discrete items including, but not limited to, the effects of tax credits, net tax benefits from trading structure changes, tax benefits from  stock-based  compensation  and  settlements  of  tax  examinations,  and  to  net  tax  on  earnings  from  foreign  operations. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations. Our future effective tax rates are likely to be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, the geographic mix of earnings, our repatriation policy or the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, by changes in or our interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, or by unexpected negative changes in business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits.\n\nIn addition, in the United States and other countries where we conduct business and in jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax, including those covered by governing bodies that enact tax laws applicable to us, such as the European Commission of the European Union, we are subject to potential changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including  changes  to  tax  laws  applicable  to  corporate  multinationals  such  as Adobe. These  countries,  governmental  bodies  and intergovernmental economic organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, have or could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined in their jurisdictions that are contrary to the way in which we have interpreted and historically applied the rules and regulations described above in such jurisdictions. In the current global tax policy environment, any changes in laws, regulations and interpretations related to these assertions could adversely affect our effective tax rates, cause us to respond by making changes to our business structure, or result in other costs to us which could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\n\nMoreover,  we  are  subject  to  the  examination  of  our  income  tax  returns  by  the  U.S.  Internal  Revenue  Service  and  other domestic and foreign tax authorities. These tax examinations are expected to focus on our research and development tax credits, intercompany  transfer  pricing  practices  and  other  matters.  We  regularly  assess  the  likelihood  of  outcomes  resulting  from  these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from these examinations. We cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\n\n## Contracting with government entities exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government procurement process.\n\nWe  provide  products  and  services,  directly  and  indirectly,  to  a  variety  of  government  entities,  both  domestically  and internationally.  Risks  associated  with  licensing  and  selling  products  and  services  to  government  entities  include  more  extended sales  and  collection  cycles,  varying  governmental  budgeting  processes  and  adherence  to  complex  procurement  regulations  and other government-specific contractual requirements. We have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to audits and investigations  relating  to  our  government  contracts  and  any  violations  could  result  in  various  civil  and  criminal  penalties  and administrative  sanctions,  including  termination  of  contracts,  payment  of  fines,  and  suspension  or  debarment  from  future government business, as well as harm to our reputation and financial results.\n\n## Risks Related to Financial Performance\n\n## Subscription offerings could create risks related to the timing of revenue recognition.\n\nWe generally recognize revenue from subscription offerings ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which typically  range  from  1  to  36  months. As  a  result,  most  of  the  subscription  revenue  we  report  in  each  quarter  is  the  result  of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Any reduction in new or renewed subscriptions in a quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results until a later quarter. Declines in new or renewed subscriptions may decrease our revenue in future quarters. Lower sales, reduced demand for our products and services, and increases in our attrition rate may not be fully reflected  in  our  results  of  operations  until  future  periods.  Our  subscription  model  could  also  make  it  difficult  for  us  to  rapidly increase  our  revenue  from  subscription-based  or  hosted  services  through  additional  sales  in  any  period,  as  revenue  from  new customers will be recognized over the applicable subscription term.\n\nAdditionally,  in  connection  with  our  sales  efforts  to  enterprise  customers,  a  number  of  factors  could  affect  our  revenue, including longer-than-expected sales and implementation cycles, potential deferral of revenue and alternative licensing arrangements. If any of our assumptions about revenue from our subscription-based offerings prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated.",

These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATING BUSINESSES\n\n- We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.\n- Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).\n- A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO NEW INITIATIVES\n\n- Our growth depends in part on our ability to extend our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets. Our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications, and related technologies and products, as well as in our existing technologies and products, and new technologies, may not generate operating income or contribute to future results of operations that meet our expectations.\n- We may engage in acquisitions and other strategic transactions or make investments, or be unable to consummate planned strategic acquisitions, which could adversely affect our results of operations or fail to enhance stockholder value.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURING\n\n- We depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers for the procurement, manufacture, assembly and testing of our products manufactured in a fabless production model. If we fail to execute supply strategies that provide supply assurance, technology leadership and reasonable margins, our business and results of operations may be harmed. We are also subject to order and shipment uncertainties that could negatively impact our results of operations.\n- There are numerous risks associated with the operation and control of our manufacturing facilities, including a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model; environmental compliance and liability; impacts related to climate change; exposure to natural disasters, health crises, geopolitical conflicts and cyber-attacks; timely supply of equipment and materials; and various manufacturing issues.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO CYBERSECURITY OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR CRITICAL INFORMATION\n\n- Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches of our IT systems, or other misappropriation of our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\n- We may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees, and our attempts to operate under a hybrid work model may not be successful.\n\n## RISKS SPECIFIC TO OUR LICENSING BUSINESS\n\n- The continued and future success of our licensing programs requires us to continue to evolve our patent portfolio and to renew or renegotiate license agreements that are expiring.\n- Efforts by some original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business.\n- Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO REGULATORY AND LEGAL CHALLENGES\n\n- Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings or other legal proceedings.",

Our primary objectives for holding derivative instruments are to manage foreign exchange risk for certain foreign currency revenues, operating expenses, receivables and payables and to manage interest rate risk associated with our cash equivalents, marketable securities and long-term debt. Derivative instruments are recorded at fair value and included in other current or noncurrent assets or liabilities based on their maturity dates. Counterparties to these derivative instruments are all major banking institutions. At September 25, 2022, the aggregate fair value of our derivative instruments recorded in total assets and in total liabilities were $271 million and $346 million, respectively. At September 26, 2021, the aggregate fair value of our derivative instruments recorded in total assets and in total liabilities were $42 million and $111 million, respectively.\n\nForeign Currency Hedges: We manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative instruments, including foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial counterparties, that may or may not be designated as hedging instruments. At September 25, 2022 and September 26, 2021, these derivative instruments had maturity dates between one and 21 months. Gains and losses arising from such contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as gains and losses on derivative instruments, net of income taxes. The hedging gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are subsequently reclassified to revenues or costs and expenses, as applicable, in the consolidated statements of operations in the same period in which the underlying transactions affect our earnings. The cash flows associated with derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedging instruments are classified as cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows, which is the same category as the hedged transaction.\n\nFor foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments, the changes in fair value are recorded in investment and other income (expense), net in the period of change. The cash flows associated with such derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are classified as cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows, which is the same category as the hedged transaction.\n\nInterest Rate Swaps: From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements that allow us to effectively convert fixedrate payments into floating-rate payments on portions of our outstanding long-term debt. We enter into these agreements, in part, to manage interest rate risk associated with our cash equivalents and marketable securities, in addition to changes in the fair value of our outstanding debt. These transactions are designated as fair value hedges, and the gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps substantially offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt that are attributable to changes in the market interest rates. The net gains and losses on the interest rate swaps, as well as the offsetting gains or losses on the related fixed-rate debt attributable to the hedged risks, are recognized as interest expense in the current period. The interest settlement payments associated with the interest rate swap agreements are classified as cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nDuring fiscal 2021, we entered into forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of forecasted interest payments on certain anticipated debt issuances. These have been designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions. The gains and losses arising from such contracts are recorded as a component in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as gains and losses on derivative instruments. When the anticipated debt issuances are completed, the hedging gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified as interest expense over the terms of the related debt issued.\n\nGross Notional Amounts: The gross notional amounts of our foreign currency and interest rate derivatives by instrument type were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. Certain performance obligations may require payment before delivery of the license or service to the customer. Included in trade receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are unbilled receivable balances which have not yet been invoiced, and are typically related to license revenue or services which are delivered prior to invoicing. As of December 3, 2021, the balance of trade receivables,  net  of  allowances  for  doubtful  accounts,  was  $1.88  billion,  inclusive  of  unbilled  receivables  of  $82  million.

      "answer": "Apple's effective tax rate in 2023 was 14.7%, while Intel's effective tax rate was -3.2%, indicating a stark contrast in their tax positions. Intel's negative effective tax rate was primarily driven by significant tax credits and adjustments such as research and development tax credits (-11.4%), non-US income taxed at different rates (-13.4%), and foreign derived intangible income benefit (-9.7%), which collectively reduced their tax burden. In contrast, Apple's effective tax rate, although lower than the statutory federal income tax rate of 21%, was positively influenced by fewer such adjustments, resulting in a more conventional effective tax rate. This comparison highlights how different business structures, global operations, and tax incentives can lead to divergent effective tax outcomes even under the same statutory rate.",

      "question": "How does Apple's exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations potentially impact its gross margins, and how does Intel's inventory valuation methodology affect its ability to manage gross margin volatility?",
      "answer": "Apple's gross margins are negatively impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations because a stronger U.S. dollar reduces the dollar value of its foreign currency-denominated sales, especially when it chooses not to raise international pricing. This directly affects its gross margins. Intel, on the other hand, manages gross margin volatility through its inventory valuation methodology, which involves forecasting demand and writing off excess or obsolete inventory when demand forecasts exceed actual demand. This impacts gross margins by adjusting the cost of goods sold based on inventory write-offs and manufacturing output decisions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From Apple's 10-K, we learn that foreign exchange rate fluctuations negatively impact gross margins, particularly when Apple chooses not to raise international pricing in response to a stronger U.S. dollar.",
        "Step 2: From Intel's 10-K, we see that inventory valuation involves forecasting demand and writing off excess or obsolete inventory when forecasts are too high, which directly affects gross margins by altering the cost of goods sold.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize \u2014 Both companies experience gross margin pressures, but from different sources: Apple from currency risk and Intel from inventory write-offs. Understanding both mechanisms reveals how each company manages gross margin volatility differently."

      "answer": "AVGO faces uncertainty in the timing and extent of software license and subscription revenue due to the nature of its contracts, which may include termination for convenience clauses, leading to fluctuations in operating results. In contrast, NVDA recognizes software license revenue up front when the software is made available to the customer, providing more immediate revenue recognition. This difference suggests that NVDA's approach may offer more predictability in revenue timing compared to AVGO's, where renewal risks and contract terms can materially affect financial stability.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From AVGO's 10-K, it is stated that the timing and extent of software license and subscription revenue is a factor contributing to operating result fluctuations, particularly due to contracts that may lack termination for convenience clauses or may not be renewed on favorable terms.",
        "Step 2: From NVDA's 10-K, it is specified that software license revenue is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer, which contrasts with AVGO's exposure to renewal and contract risk.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the two approaches: AVGO's revenue predictability is more at risk due to contract structure and renewal uncertainty, while NVDA's upfront recognition provides more immediate and predictable revenue, impacting the stability of their respective operating results."

Any additional restrictions could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results and cash flow.\n\n## Failure to enter into software license agreements on a satisfactory basis could materially adversely affect our business.\n\nMany of our existing software customers have multi-year enterprise software license agreements, some of which involve substantial aggregate fee amounts. These customers often do not have a contractual obligation to purchase additional solutions and often have termination for convenience clauses without payment of a substantive penalty. The failure or inability to renew customer agreements of similar scope, on terms that are commercially attractive to us, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results and cash flow, or software license agreements without termination for convenience clauses could cause our operating results to fluctuate.\n\n## Our use of open source software in certain products and services could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.\n\nMany of our products and services incorporate open source software, the use of which may subject us to certain conditions, including the obligation to offer such products for no cost or to make the proprietary source code of those products publicly available. Open source licenses are generally 'as-is' and do not provide warranties, support or assurance of title or controls on origin, which may expose us to potential liability if the software fails to work or has security vulnerabilities.\n\nAlthough we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products to unintended conditions and security vulnerabilities, we may receive third-party claims regarding our compliance with the conditions of such open source licenses and we may be required to take steps to remedy an alleged i nfringement or noncompliance, including modifying or releasing our product code or paying damages.\n\n## Our sales to government customers subject us to uncertainties and governmental regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nOur contracts signed with the U.S. federal, state and local government and non-U.S. government agencies are generally subject to annual fiscal funding approval and may be renegotiated or terminated at the discretion of the government. Termination, renegotiation or the lack of funding approval for a contract could adversely affect our sales, revenue and reputation. Additionally, our government contracts and our arrangements with channel partners who may sell directly to government customers are generally subject to requirements that may generally not be present in commercial contracts and/or may be complex, as well as audits and investigations. Failure to meet contractual requirements could result in various civil and criminal actions and penalties, and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with the government, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.\n\n## Failure to effectively manage our products and services lifecycles could harm our business.\n\nAs part of the natural lifecycle of our products and services, customers are informed when products or services will be reaching their end of life or end of availability and will no longer be supported or receive updates and security patches. If these products or services remain subject to a service contract, the customer may transition to alternative products or services. Failure to effectively manage our products and services lifecycles could lead to customer dissatisfaction and contractual liabilities, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\n\n## Our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations.\n\nOur operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations may occur on a quarterly and annual basis and are due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to many of the risks described elsewhere in this 'Risk Factors' section, these factors include, among others:\n\n- the timing of launches by our customers of new products in which our products are included and changes in end-user demand for our customers' products;\n- fl uctuations in the levels of component or product inventories held by our customers, which may lead to increased requests to delay shipment of our semiconductor products;\n- the shift to cloud-based IT solutions and services, such as hyperscale computing, which may adversely affect the timing and volume of sales of our semiconductor products for use in traditional enterprise data centers;\n- the timing and extent of our software license and subscription revenue, and other non-product revenue;\n- the timing of new software contracts and renewals, including the timing of software contracts that do not have termination for convenience clauses;",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## NVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated F inancial Statements\n\n(Continued)\n\n## License and Development Arrangements\n\nOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP components. A s a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.\n\n## Software Licensing\n\nOur software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with support, which includes the right to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspecified software updates and upgrades. Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. Software support revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.\n\n## Cloud Services\n\nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software and hardware infrastructure without taking possession of the software or hardware, are provided on a subscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage. Revenue related to subscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services based on usage is recognized as usage occurs. Cloud services are typically sold on a standalone basis, but certain offerings may be sold with hardware and/or software and related support.\n\n## Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\n\nOur contracts may contain more than one of the products and services listed above, each of which is separately accounted for as a distinct performance obligation. We account for multiple agreements with a single customer as a single contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract.\n\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in an arrangement with multiple performance obligations on a relative standalone selling  price  basis.  The  standalone  selling  price  reflects  the  price  we  would  charge  for  a  specific  product  or  serv ice  if  it  were  sold  separately   in  similar circumstances and to similar customers. When determining standalone selling price, we maximize the use of observable inputs.\n\n## Product Warranties\n\nWe offer a limited warranty to end-users ranging from one  to three years for products to repair or replace products for manufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\n\n## Stock-based Compensation\n\nWe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units, or PSUs, that are based on our corporate financial performance targets. We use a M onte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of PSUs that are based on our stock performance compared to market performance, or market-based PSUs. The compensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model based on performance targets probable of achievement. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP , using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in M arch and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model. A dditionally , for RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs, we estimate expected forfeitures based on our historical forfeitures.\n\n## Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs\n\nWe currently , are, and will likely  continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including potential regulatory  proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments or judgments. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation,",

      "answer": "ACN assumes an 8.8% annual increase in U.S. health care costs for its postretirement plan, which directly affects its long-term benefit obligation estimates by increasing the projected cash flows needed to cover these costs. This rate is expected to gradually decline to 4.0% by 2049. The reliance on such specific health care cost projections introduces financial risk due to potential inaccuracies in forecasting long-term trends. In contrast, TXN only mentions the existence of assumed health care cost trend rates without disclosing actual figures, making it impossible to assess the magnitude of similar risks in their postretirement obligations. This lack of transparency limits comparative analysis and highlights the importance of detailed disclosures in evaluating financial exposure to health care cost increases.",

      "answer": "Cisco accounts for variability in its cooperative marketing programs by estimating expected usage of these programs, applying either the expected value or most likely estimate method, and updates these estimates at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. This directly impacts their revenue recognition, as deviations from these estimates could adversely affect revenue. Intel, on the other hand, participates in cooperative advertising and marketing programs that partially reimburse customers for marketing activities, and these expenses are accounted for as part of their operating expenditures. While Intel does not explicitly quantify the variability impact, these programs are subject to defined criteria and influence marketing spend forecasting and brand investment returns.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Cisco discloses that cooperative marketing programs are part of variable consideration and directly affect revenue recognition, with estimates updated at each reporting period.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Intel discloses participation in cooperative advertising and marketing programs that reimburse customers for marketing activities involving Intel-branded products.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies disclose the existence and financial relevance of cooperative marketing programs, but differ in how they account for variability: Cisco explicitly ties it to revenue recognition estimates, while Intel treats it as part of operating expenditures subject to defined criteria."

Both companies face inventory risks, but Intel explicitly quantifies its inventory value and emphasizes judgment in forecasting and valuation, while Cisco highlights nonlinear shipping patterns and demand unpredictability as key contributors to inventory risk.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Cisco's 10-K notes that increased procurement to shorten lead times could lead to 'material excess and obsolete inventory charges' if demand decreases.",

      "answer": "Cisco (CSCO) records a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments in excess of future demand forecasts, aligning with its valuation of excess and obsolete inventory. This suggests a proactive financial recognition of inventory risk stemming from fixed supplier agreements. In contrast, Intel (INTC) emphasizes judgment and sensitivity analyses in its inventory valuation, particularly for excess and obsolete inventory, due to factors like dynamic pricing, customer forecasts, and limited historical data for new product launches. Intel\u2019s audit process involves extensive testing of demand forecasts and pricing assumptions, indicating a more analytical and forward-looking approach to inventory risk. The $11.1 billion net inventory figure for Intel further underscores the scale and complexity of its inventory management challenges compared to Cisco\u2019s more commitment-driven risk exposure.",

      "question": "What is the combined impact of R&D tax credits on Cisco's and Intel's effective tax rates in fiscal 2023, given Cisco's effective tax rate of 15.6% and Intel's documented decrease in effective tax rate driven by R&D credits?",
      "answer": "The combined impact of R&D tax credits on Cisco's and Intel's effective tax rates in fiscal 2023 is a reduction reflected in both companies' effective tax rates, with Cisco reporting 15.6% and Intel noting a decrease primarily driven by R&D tax credits. While Cisco's rate was influenced by R&D credits among other factors, Intel specifically highlighted R&D credits as a key contributor to its lower effective tax rate. Without exact figures for Intel's 2023 effective tax rate, the direction and magnitude of the R&D credit's influence are clearly stated in both companies' filings.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Cisco's effective tax rate in fiscal 2023 was 15.6%, influenced by R&D tax credits among other factors.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Intel's effective tax rate decreased in 2023, primarily driven by R&D tax credits, though the exact rate is not stated.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies' effective tax rates were positively impacted by R&D tax credits, but only Cisco provides the exact effective tax rate (15.6%). Intel emphasizes the role of R&D credits without specifying the final effective rate, making a full numerical comparison impossible but the directional impact clear."

Cisco's product gross margin decreased by 2.1 percentage points, primarily due to increased costs from freight, expedite fees, and higher component and commodity costs. These cost pressures were partially offset by favorable pricing actions taken during fiscal 2022.

(1)\n\nProduct gross margin decreased by 2.1 percentage points primarily driven by negative impacts from productivity, largely driven by increased costs related to supply constraints from freight, expedites, and higher component and commodity costs. These impacts were  partially  offset  by  favorable  pricing.  The  benefit  we  saw  from  favorable  pricing  was  primarily  driven  by  price  increases implemented during fiscal 2022, to partially offset increases in components and commodity costs, freight and logistics costs, driven by supply constraints.\n\n## Supply Constraints Impacts and Risks\n\nWe continue to manage through significant supply constraints seen industry-wide due to component shortages caused, in part, by the COVID-19 pandemic, and for which the duration of such constraints is uncertain. These shortages have resulted in increased costs (i.e., component and other commodity costs, freight, expedite fees, etc.) which have had a negative impact on our product gross margin and have resulted in extended lead times for us and our customers. We have taken a number of steps in order to mitigate  the  supply  constraint  related  impacts  including:  partnering  with  several  of  our  key  suppliers  utilizing  our  volume purchasing ability and extending supply coverage, including, in certain cases, revising supplier arrangements; paying significantly higher  component  and  logistics  costs  to  secure  supply;  modifying  our  product  designs  in  order  to  leverage  alternate  suppliers, where  possible;  and  continually  optimizing  our  inventory  build  and  customer  delivery  plans,  among  others.  We  believe  these actions are helping us to optimize our access to critical components and meet customer demand for our products. We continue to see solid demand across the majority of our portfolio. As a result, in order to secure supply to meet customer demand, we have increased our inventory balances, inventory purchase commitments, and inventory deposits and prepayments (see '-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Inventory Supply Chain'), which, in turn, has increased our supply chain exposure. Additionally, in certain situations, we have prepaid or made deposits with suppliers to secure future supply. These actions significantly increase the risk of future material excess and obsolete inventory and related losses if customer demand were to suddenly and significantly decrease in future  periods.  While  we  believe  we  are  taking  the  right  strategic  and  operational  actions  to  address  the  supply  situation,  we recognize the increased risks.\n\n## Service Gross Margin\n\nOur service gross margin percentage increased by 0.3 percentage points primarily due to lower headcount-related and delivery costs and favorable mix of service offerings, partially offset by lower sales volume.\n\nOur service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals, our strategic investments in headcount, and the resources we deploy to support the overall service",

Any  failure  to  maintain  high-quality  technical  support,  or  a  market perception  that  we  do  not  maintain  high-quality  technical  support,  could  adversely  affect  our  reputation,  our  ability  to  sell  and renew our applications and infrastructure offerings to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results, and financial position.\n\nOur cloud offerings and hardware offerings are complex, and if we cannot successfully manage this complexity, including the sourcing  of  technologies  and  components,  the  results  of  these  businesses  will  suffer. We  depend  on  suppliers  to  develop, manufacture and deliver on a timely basis the necessary technologies and components for our hardware products that we market and sell to our customers and that we use as a part of our cloud infrastructure to deliver our cloud offerings, and there are some technologies and components that can only be purchased from a single vendor due to price, quality, technology, availability or other business constraints. Our supply chain operations have been, and likely will continue to be, negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and could also be disrupted by industry consolidation and component constraints or shortages, natural disasters, political unrest,  other  public  health  crises,  changes  to  trade  policies,  port  stoppages  or  other  transportation  disruptions  or  slowdowns,  or other factors affecting the countries or regions where these single source component vendors are located or where the products are being shipped. If one or more of the risks described above occurs, our cloud and license business and hardware business and related operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nWe are susceptible to third-party manufacturing and logistics delays, which could result in the loss of sales and customers. We outsource a majority of our manufacturing, assembly, delivery and technology of, and certain component designs for, our hardware products  to  a  variety  of  companies,  many  of  which  are  located  outside  the  U.S.  From  time  to  time,  these  partners  experience production problems, delays or cannot meet our demand for products. The conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic created, and likely will continue to create, delays in our supply chain. Third-party manufacturing and logistics delays attributable to the effects of COVID-19 caused delays in the manufacturing and fulfilment of certain customer orders during fiscal 2022. Ongoing or future delays in manufacturing could cause the loss of additional sales, delayed revenue recognition or an increase in our hardware products expenses, all of which could adversely affect the margins of our cloud and license business and hardware business. These challenges could arise if we alter our manufacturing strategies, suppliers, or locations.\n\nOur hardware revenues and profitability have declined and could continue to decline. Our hardware business may adversely affect our total revenues and overall profitability and related growth rates. We may not achieve our estimated revenue, profit or other financial projections with respect to our hardware business in a timely manner or at all due to a number of factors, including:\n\n- our focus on certain of our more profitable Oracle Engineered Systems and certain other hardware products we consider strategic and the de-emphasis of certain of our lower profit margin commodity hardware products;\n- changes in strategies and frequency for the development and introduction of new versions or next generations of our hardware products;\n- decreased customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products approach the end of their useful lives; and\n- general supply chain material shortages worldwide, which were further exacerbated globally as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSupply chain shortages have in some instances resulted in increases to the costs of production of our hardware products that we may not be able to pass on to our customers. In addition, we have in some instances responded to such shortages by committing to higher inventory purchases and balances relative to our historical positions in order to secure manufacturing capacity, which has in some instances increased inventory excess and obsolescence risk and adversely impacted our operating cash flows.\n\nOur periodic workforce restructurings and reorganizations can be disruptive. We are currently restructuring our workforce and in the past we have restructured or made other adjustments to our workforce in response to management changes, product changes, performance issues, changes in strategies, acquisitions and other internal",

      "question": "What is the combined percentage of total revenue generated from the Americas by both Cisco (CSCO) and Oracle (ORCL) in their respective 2022 fiscal years, and how does this compare to their previous year percentages?",
      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Cisco (CSCO) generated 57.8% of its total revenue from the Americas, while Oracle (ORCL) generated 57% of its total revenue from the same region. Combined, the Americas contributed 114.8% of total revenue across both companies in 2022. In the prior year (2021), Cisco reported 58.5% and Oracle reported 55%, resulting in a combined total of 113.5%. Therefore, the combined Americas revenue percentage increased by 1.3 percentage points from 2021 to 2022.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Cisco's 2022 Americas revenue percentage is 57.8%, and its 2021 percentage is 58.5%.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Oracle's 2022 Americas revenue percentage is 57%, and its 2021 percentage is 55%.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Combine the percentages for 2022 (57.8% + 57% = 114.8%) and for 2021 (58.5% + 55% = 113.5%), then calculate the difference (114.8% - 113.5% = 1.3 percentage points)."

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2024 and related notes, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, 'Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn  this  section,  we  will  describe  the  general  financial  condition  and  the  results  of  operations  of Adv anced  Micro  Dev ices,  Inc.  and  its  wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectiv ely, 'us,' 'our' or 'AMD'), including a discussion of our results of operations for 2024 compared to 2023, an analysis of changes in our financial condition and a discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements. Discussions of 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and  2022  that  are  not  included  in  this  Form  10-K  can  be  found  in  'Management's  Discussion  and Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of Operations' in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023.\n\n## Overview\n\nIn 2024, we deliv ered strong annual rev enue growth with net rev enue increasing 14% to $25.8 billion, compared to $22.7 billion in 2023. T his growth was driv en by the performance of our Data Center and Client segments. Data Center net rev enue of $12.6 billion increased by 94% compared to $6.5 billion in 2023, driv en by higher sales of our AMD Instinct\u2122 GPUs and AMD EPYC\u2122 CPUs. Client segment net rev enue of $7.1 billion in 2024 increased by 52% compared to $4.7 billion in 2023, primarily due to higher sales of our AMD Ryzen\u2122 mobile and desktop processors. The increase in annual net rev enue was  partially  offset  by  a  decrease  in  net  rev enue  in  our  Gaming  and  Embedded  segments.  Gaming  net  rev enue  of  $2.6  billion  decreased  by  58% compared to $6.2 billion in 2023. The decrease in net rev enue was primarily due to lower semi-custom product rev enue. Embedded net rev enue of $3.6 billion decreased by 33% compared to net rev enue of $5.3 billion in 2023, as customers normalized their inv entory lev els.\n\nDuring the year, we successfully launched multiple leadership products and made significant progress executing our AI strategy. One of our priorities in 2024 was to accelerate growth in our  Data  Center  segment.  The  demand for  our  Data  Center AI  accelerator  products  was  v ery  strong  led  by  large hyperscale  cloud  customers  deploying  our  AMD  Instinct  MI300X   GPU  accelerators.  During  the  year,  we  unv eiled  an  accelerated  AMD  Instinct accelerator roadmap to deliv er an annual cadence of leadership AI solutions. T o further expand our high-performance serv er CPU portfolio, we launched our  5th  Gen  AMD  EPYC\u2122  processors,  formerly  codenamed  'Turin,'  built  with  our  latest  'Z en  5'  core  architecture  designed  to  deliv er  leadership performance and efficiency.\n\nWe took a major step in our AI PC roadmap with the launch of AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series processors that combine leadership compute capabilities based on our 'Zen 5' architecture and an industry-leading neural processing unit (NPU) powered by our X DNA 2 architecture for next-generation AI PCs. We added to our Ryzen family of desktop CPUs with the Ryzen 9000 series processors for laptop and desktop PCs that deliv er leadership performance in gaming, productiv ity and content creation. In our Gaming segment, we extended our multigenerational partnership with Sony as they introduced the PlayStation\u00ae 5 Pro, which features a new AMD semi-custom SoC designed to deliv er increases in graphics and ray tracing performance to enable AIdriv en upscaling.\n\nWe expanded our adaptive computing portfolio with differentiated solutions with the launch of the new Versal\u2122 Series Gen 2 dev ices, including the new Versal AI Edge Series Gen 2 and Versal Prime Series Gen 2 adaptiv e SoCs, which bring preprocessing, AI inference, and postprocessing together in a single dev ice for end-to-end acceleration of AI-driv en embedded systems.\n\nT o execute our AI strategy, we brought together multiple AI teams across AMD to driv e dev elopment of a comprehensiv e software ecosystem spanning our  full  product  portfolio.  We  made  sev eral  key  optimizations  and  introduced  new  features  in  the  latest  AMD  ROCm\u2122  software  that  increased performance  in  key  generativ e  AI  workloads,  expanded  support  and  optimization  for  additional  frameworks  and  libraries,  and  simplified  the  ov erall developer experience. We also made strategic inv estments to further expand our AI software capabilities with the acquisition of Silo AI Oy (Silo AI), an AI lab based in Finland. The acquisition of Silo AI enables customers to accelerate dev elopment and deployment of AI models on AMD hardware. Silo AI has  also  dev eloped  a  software  stack  used  to  train  multiple  state-of-the-art  large  language  models  (LLMs)  on  AMD  Instinct  accelerators  that  can accelerate the dev elopment of highly-performant AMD training solutions.",

        "Step 1: From AMD's 10-K filing, extract Gaming operating income for 2024 ($290 million) and 2023 ($971 million) to calculate the year-over-year decline of $681 million.",
        "Step 2: From Microsoft's 10-K filing, extract the reported $6.0 billion or 39% Gaming revenue increase in 2024, noting the 44-point net impact from the Activision Blizzard acquisition as a key growth driver.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nallocated  on  a  relative  standalone  selling  price  basis  by  maximizing  the  use  of  observable  inputs  to  determine  the standalone selling  price  for  each  performance  obligation);  and  (5)  recognition  of  revenue  when,  or  as,  we  satisfy  a performance obligation.\n\n## Product Sales Revenue\n\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.\n\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated  product  returns  at  the  time  revenue  is  recognized,  based  primarily  on  historical  return  rates.  However,  if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.\n\nOur customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are  earmarked  for  market  segment  development  and  are  designed  to  support  our  partners'  activities  while  also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.\n\n## License and Development Arrangements\n\nOur  license  and  development  arrangements  with  customers  typically  require  significant  customization  of  our  IP components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a  single  performance  obligation  over  the  period  in  which  the  development  services  are  performed.  We  measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.\n\nRefer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe recognize  federal,  state  and  foreign  current  tax  liabilities  or  assets  based  on  our  estimate  of  taxes  payable  or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.\n\nOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with  uncertainties  in  the  application  of  complex  tax  laws.  Our  estimates  of  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.\n\nAs of January 30, 2022, we had a valuation allowance of $907 million related to state and certain other deferred tax assets  that  management  determined  are  not  likely  to  be  realized  due  to  jurisdictional  projections  of  future  taxable income,  tax  attributes  usage  limitation  by  certain  jurisdictions,  and  potential  utilization  limitations  of  tax  attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during the period.\n\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.",

Therefore,  revenues  for  license  support  contracts  and  hardware  support contracts are generally recognized ratably over the contractual periods that the support services are provided.\n\n## Revenue Recognition for Cloud Licenses and On-Premise Licenses\n\nRevenues from distinct cloud license and on-premise license performance obligations are generally recognized upfront at the point in  time when  the  software  is  made  available  to  the  customer  to  download  and  use.  Revenues  from  usage-based  royalty arrangements for distinct cloud licenses and on-premise licenses are recognized at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs. For usage-based royalty arrangements with a fixed minimum guarantee amount, the minimum amount is generally recognized upfront when the software is made available to the royalty customer.\n\n## Revenue Recognition for Hardware Products\n\nThe hardware product and related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are  accounted  for  as  a  combined  performance  obligation. The  revenues  for  this  combined  performance  obligation  are  generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product is delivered and ownership is transferred to the customer.\n\n## Revenue Recognition for Services\n\nServices revenues are generally recognized over time as the services are performed. Revenues for fixed price services are generally recognized over time applying input methods to estimate progress to completion. Revenues for consumption-based services are generally recognized as the services are performed.\n\n## Allocation of the Transaction Price for Contracts that have Multiple Performance Obligations\n\nMany of our contracts include multiple performance obligations. Judgment is required in determining whether each performance obligation is distinct. Oracle products and services generally do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency; therefore,  our  products  and  services  are  generally  not  combined.  We  allocate  the  transaction  price  for  each  contract  to  each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price (SSP) for each performance obligation within each contract.\n\nWe use judgment in determining the SSP for products and services. For substantially  all  performance  obligations  except  cloud licenses  and  on-premise  licenses,  we  are  able  to  establish  the  SSP  based  on  the  observable  prices  of  products  or  services  sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. We typically establish an SSP range for our products and services which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change. Our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses have not historically been sold on a standalone basis, as the vast majority of all customers elect to purchase license support contracts at the time of a cloud license and on-premise license purchase. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net  fees  paid  by  the  customer  to  access  the  license.  We  are  unable  to  establish  the  SSP  for  our  cloud  licenses  and  on-premise licenses based on observable prices given the same products are sold for a broad range of amounts (that is, the selling price is highly variable) and a representative SSP is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence. As a result, the SSP for a cloud license and an on-premise license included in a contract with multiple performance obligations is generally determined by applying a residual approach whereby all other performance obligations within a contract are first allocated a portion of the transaction price based upon their respective SSPs, with any residual amount of transaction price allocated to cloud license and onpremise license revenues.",

NVDA reported a tax benefit of $337 million due to stock-based compensation, while ORCL reported a tax expense of $263 million from the same factor.

Gamers  and  others  are  therefore  able  to  mine cryptocurrency  using  our  GPUs,  although  we  have  limited  visibility  into  how  much  this  impacts  our  overall  GPU demand.  Volatility  in  the  cryptocurrency  market,  including  changes  in  the  prices  of  cryptocurrencies  or  method  of verifying transactions, such as proof of work or proof of stake, can impact demand for our products and degrade our ability to accurately estimate it. We are unable to estimate with any degree of precision the impact this volatility is likely to have in the future.\n\nData Center revenue was up 58% from a year ago primarily driven by sales of NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPUs across both training  and  inference  for  cloud  computing  and AI  workloads  such  as  natural  language  processing  and deep recommender models.\n\nProfessional Visualization revenue was up 100% from a year ago driven by the ramp of NVIDIA Ampere architecture products and strong demand for workstations as enterprises support hybrid work environments, as well as growth in workloads such as 3D design, AI and rendering.\n\nAutomotive revenue was up 6% from a year ago due to self-driving and AI cockpit solutions offset by a decline in legacy cockpit revenue.\n\nOEM and Other revenue was up 84% from a year ago primarily driven by CMP sales. CMP revenue was $550 million for the fiscal year and was nominal in the prior year.\n\nRevenue  for  our  CMP  products  declined  significantly  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  fiscal  year  2022.  We  are  unable  to estimate with any degree of precision the impact that volatility in the cryptocurrency market, as discussed above, is likely to have on future CMP sales.\n\nGross margin for fiscal year 2022 was up 260 basis points from a year ago driven by lower Mellanox acquisition-related charges, including a non-recurring inventory step-up charge of $161 million in fiscal year 2021. Margins also benefited from a higher-end mix within Gaming, partially offset by a mix shift within Data Center.\n\nOperating expenses for fiscal year 2022 were up 27% from a year ago primarily driven by stock-based compensation, compensation-related costs associated with employee growth and higher infrastructure costs.\n\nIncome from operations was $10.04 billion, up 122% from a year ago. Net income and net income per diluted share were $9.75 billion and $3.85, up 125% and 123%, respectively, from a year ago.\n\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $21.21 billion, up from $11.56 billion a year earlier. The increase reflects operating cash flow generation and $5.00 billion of debt issuance proceeds.\n\nWe paid $399 million in quarterly cash dividends in fiscal year 2022.\n\n## Market Platform Highlights\n\nAt  our  November  2021  GPU  Technology  Conference,  we  announced  general  availability  of  NVIDIA  Omniverse Enterprise;  65  new  and  updated  software  development  kits,  including  NVIDIA  Riva,  Modulus,  ReOpt,  Morpheus, cuNumeric, and Clara Holoscan; NVIDIA Quantum-2 400Gbps switch and end-to-end networking platform; and NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin for edge AI and autonomous machines.\n\nIn our Gaming platform during fiscal year 2022, we further expanded our desktop and laptop GeForce RTX 30 Series GPU line-ups; expanded the RTX ecosystem of games and applications to over 240; announced plans to integrate NVIDIA DLSS into the Unity game engine; and introduced a new high-performance membership tier to GeForce NOW.\n\nIn  our  Data  Center  platform,  we  launched  new  NVIDIA A30  and A10  GPUs  for  mainstream AI,  data  analytics  and graphics; debuted a new class of NVIDIA-Certified Systems with leading server OEMs; unveiled NVIDIA Grace, our first Arm-based data center CPU; launched the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite; unveiled the NVIDIA Base Command and Fleet Command AI software offerings; and announced plans to build Earth-2, an AI supercomputer dedicated to addressing the global climate change crisis.\n\nIn our Professional Visualization platform, we unveiled NVIDIA RTX GPUs for next-generation notebook and desktop workstations; and launched NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise for collaborative 3D design, digital twins and virtual worlds and NVIDIA Omniverse for Creators.",

      "answer": "The combined total gross deferred tax assets for ADBE and QCOM in 2024 is $10,876 million ($2,765 million for ADBE and $8,111 million for QCOM). ADBE has a valuation allowance of $725 million, resulting in net deferred tax assets of $2,040 million, while QCOM has a valuation allowance of $2,061 million, resulting in net deferred tax assets of $6,050 million.

For equity method investments, we record impairment losses in earnings only when impairments are considered other-thantemporary.\n\nDerivatives. Our primary objectives for holding derivative instruments are to manage foreign exchange risk for certain foreign currency revenues, operating expenses, receivables and payables and to manage interest rate risk associated with our cash equivalents, marketable securities and long-term debt. Derivative instruments are recorded at fair value and included in other current or noncurrent assets or liabilities based on their maturity dates. Counterparties to these derivative instruments are all major banking institutions. At September 29, 2024, the aggregate fair value of our derivative instruments recorded in total assets and in total liabilities were $30 million and $138 million, respectively. At September 24, 2023, the aggregate fair value of our derivative instruments recorded in total assets and in total liabilities were $32 million and $317 million, respectively.\n\nForeign Currency Hedges: We manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative instruments, including foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial counterparties, that may or may not be designated as hedging instruments. These derivative instruments generally have maturity dates between one and 24 months. Gains and losses arising from such contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as gains and losses on derivative instruments, net of income taxes. The hedging gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are subsequently reclassified to revenues or costs and expenses, as applicable, in the consolidated statements of operations in the same period in which the underlying transactions affect our earnings. For foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments, the changes in fair value are recorded in investment and other income (expense), net in the period of change.\n\nThe cash flows associated with such derivative instruments are classified as cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows, which is the same category as the hedged transaction.\n\nInterest Rate Swaps: From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements that allow us to effectively convert fix ed-rate payments into floating-rate payments on portions of our outstanding long-term debt. We enter into these agreements to manage interest rate risk associated with our cash equivalents and marketable securities, in addition to changes in the fair value of our outstanding debt. These transactions are designated as fair value hedges, and the gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps substantially offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt that are attributable to changes in the market interest rates. The net gains and losses on the interest rate swaps, as well as the offsetting gains or losses on the related fix ed-rate debt attributable to the hedged risks, are recognized as interest ex pense in the current period. The interest settlement payments associated with the interest rate swap agreements are classified as cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nFrom time to time, we also enter into forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of forecasted interest payments on certain anticipated debt issuances. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions. The gains and losses arising from such contracts are recorded as a component in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as gains and losses on derivative instruments. When the anticipated debt is issued, any associated swaps are terminated, and the hedging gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are recorded to interest expense over the term of the hedged portions of the related debt issued.\n\nGross Notional Amounts: The gross notional amounts of our foreign currency and interest rate derivatives by instrument type were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

For equity method investments, we record impairment losses in earnings only when impairments are considered other-thantemporary.\n\nDerivatives. Our primary objectives for holding derivative instruments are to manage foreign exchange risk for certain foreign currency revenues, operating expenses, receivables and payables and to manage interest rate risk associated with our cash equivalents, marketable securities and long-term debt. Derivative instruments are recorded at fair value and included in other current or noncurrent assets or liabilities based on their maturity dates. Counterparties to these derivative instruments are all major banking institutions. At September 29, 2024, the aggregate fair value of our derivative instruments recorded in total assets and in total liabilities were $30 million and $138 million, respectively. At September 24, 2023, the aggregate fair value of our derivative instruments recorded in total assets and in total liabilities were $32 million and $317 million, respectively.\n\nForeign Currency Hedges: We manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative instruments, including foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial counterparties, that may or may not be designated as hedging instruments. These derivative instruments generally have maturity dates between one and 24 months. Gains and losses arising from such contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as gains and losses on derivative instruments, net of income taxes. The hedging gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are subsequently reclassified to revenues or costs and expenses, as applicable, in the consolidated statements of operations in the same period in which the underlying transactions affect our earnings. For foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments, the changes in fair value are recorded in investment and other income (expense), net in the period of change.\n\nThe cash flows associated with such derivative instruments are classified as cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows, which is the same category as the hedged transaction.\n\nInterest Rate Swaps: From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements that allow us to effectively convert fix ed-rate payments into floating-rate payments on portions of our outstanding long-term debt. We enter into these agreements to manage interest rate risk associated with our cash equivalents and marketable securities, in addition to changes in the fair value of our outstanding debt. These transactions are designated as fair value hedges, and the gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps substantially offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt that are attributable to changes in the market interest rates. The net gains and losses on the interest rate swaps, as well as the offsetting gains or losses on the related fix ed-rate debt attributable to the hedged risks, are recognized as interest ex pense in the current period. The interest settlement payments associated with the interest rate swap agreements are classified as cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nFrom time to time, we also enter into forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of forecasted interest payments on certain anticipated debt issuances.

      "question": "How does the reliance on subscription revenue growth for LinkedIn Premium Subscriptions at Microsoft compare with Broadcom's risk related to the timing and extent of software license and subscription revenue in terms of impact on financial stability?",
      "answer": "Microsoft's LinkedIn Premium Subscriptions are a key driver of LinkedIn's revenue, with growth dependent on increasing the number of members and delivering AI-enabled services that provide value and engagement. This subscription-based model contributes directly to financial stability by ensuring predictable and recurring revenue streams. In contrast, Broadcom highlights the timing and extent of software license and subscription revenue as a major factor contributing to fluctuations in their operating results. Broadcom's reliance on renewals and the absence of guaranteed future revenue from multi-year agreements with termination-for-convenience clauses expose them to greater financial volatility. Thus, while both companies depend on subscription revenue, Microsoft's focus on expanding subscriptions supports stability, whereas Broadcom's uncertainty around renewal timing and scope introduces risk to their financial predictability.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Broadcom identifies 'the timing and extent of our software license and subscription revenue' as a key factor in operating result fluctuations.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - LinkedIn's revenue is 'mainly affected by demand from enterprises and professionals for subscriptions to Talent Solutions, Sales Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions.'",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Microsoft's subscription growth strategy for LinkedIn contributes to financial predictability, while Broadcom's exposure to timing and uncertainty in renewals introduces financial volatility."

      "question": "What is the combined total of Adobe's fiscal 2023 subscription revenue and Qualcomm's fiscal 2023 valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, and how does the recognition method of Adobe's subscription revenue contrast with the financial reporting implications of Qualcomm's deferred tax asset valuation?",
      "answer": "Adobe's fiscal 2023 subscription revenue totaled $11.3 billion, while Qualcomm reported a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of $1.2 billion for the same period. Adobe recognizes subscription revenue ratably over the term of customer agreements or based on usage for certain offerings, which provides a more predictable and recurring revenue stream. In contrast, Qualcomm's valuation allowance reflects uncertainty in realizing future tax benefits, which directly impacts its deferred tax asset carrying value and overall financial position. Together, these metrics illustrate contrasting financial reporting approaches: one focused on stable, forward-looking revenue recognition and the other on conservative asset valuation due to market or operational uncertainties.",

      "question": "How does Apple's risk of capital asset impairment due to supply chain constraints compare with Oracle's capital investment strategy as reflected in its fiscal 2022 cash flows?",
      "answer": "Apple faces a risk of capital asset impairment due to its reliance on custom components from single suppliers, which can lead to write-downs if supply constraints or forecast inaccuracies occur. This risk is heightened by the rapid pace of product obsolescence in its industry. In contrast, Oracle reported $11.2 billion in net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2022, which included investments in capital and intangible assets to support growth. This suggests Oracle was actively deploying capital to expand or enhance its asset base, rather than facing impairment risks. Therefore, while Apple's capital assets are exposed to potential impairment due to supply chain volatility and demand forecasting risks, Oracle's capital investment strategy during fiscal 2022 was more focused on growth and less on asset write-downs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Apple records write-downs for capital assets held at suppliers' facilities and inventory prepayments when impairment occurs due to supply chain constraints or forecast inaccuracies.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Oracle reported $11.2 billion in net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2022, including investments in capital and intangible assets to support growth.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Apple's capital assets are at risk of impairment due to supply chain and forecasting challenges, while Oracle's capital activities in fiscal 2022 reflect a growth-oriented strategy involving new investments rather than asset impairments."

          "chunk_text": "The Company's new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers' yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements. When the Company's supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained,  or  when  an  outsourcing  partner  has  delayed  shipments  of  completed  products  to  the  Company,  the  Company's business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely  affect  the  Company's  business,  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition.  The  Company's  business  and  financial performance  could  also  be  materially  adversely  affected  depending  on  the  time  required  to  obtain  sufficient  quantities  from  the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\n\n## The Company's products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company's business and result in harm to the Company's reputation.\n\nThe  Company  offers  complex  hardware  and  software  products  and  services  that  can  be  affected  by  design  and  manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company's products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company's products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company's service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company's services from time to time have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues  and  defects  in  the  hardware,  software  and  services  it  offers.  Failure  to  do  so  can  result  in  widespread  technical  and performance issues affecting the Company's products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims,  recalls,  product  replacements  or  modifications,  write-offs  of  inventory,  property,  plant  and  equipment,  and/or  intangible assets,  and  significant  warranty  and  other  expenses,  including  litigation  costs  and  regulatory  fines.  Quality  problems  can  also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company's products and services, and result in harm to the Company's reputation, loss  of  competitive  advantage,  poor  market  acceptance,  reduced  demand  for  products  and  services,  delay  in  new  product  and service introductions and lost sales.\n\n## The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.\n\nThe  Company  records  a  write-down  for  product  and  component  inventories  that  have  become  obsolete  or  exceed  anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers' facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the  asset  exceeds  its  fair  value.  Although  the  Company  believes  its  inventory,  capital  assets,  inventory  prepayments  and  other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.\n\nThe  Company  orders  components  for  its  products  and  builds  inventory  in  advance  of  product  announcements  and  shipments. Manufacturing  purchase  obligations  cover  the  Company's  forecasted  component  and  manufacturing  requirements,  typically  for periods  up  to  150  days.  Because  the  Company's  markets  are  volatile,  competitive  and  subject  to  rapid  technology  and  price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\n\n## The  Company  relies  on  access  to  third-party  intellectual  property,  which  may  not  be  available  to  the  Company  on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\n\nThe Company's products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in  the  future  may  compete,  current  extensive  patent  coverage  and  the  rapid  rate  of  issuance  of  new  patents,  the  Company's products  and  services  can  unknowingly  infringe  existing  patents  or  intellectual  property  rights  of  others.  From  time  to  time,  the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.",

      "answer": "NVIDIA extended the useful lives of its server, storage, and network equipment, resulting in a $135 million increase in operating income for fiscal year 2024 due to lower depreciation expenses. This indicates a cost management strategy focused on optimizing asset utilization over time. In contrast, Oracle recognizes cloud services revenue ratably or based on customer usage, which reflects a revenue recognition strategy tied directly to service delivery patterns. Comparing these approaches reveals that NVIDIA focuses on spreading infrastructure costs over a longer period to improve profitability metrics, while Oracle aligns revenue recognition closely with actual service consumption, highlighting different financial reporting strategies in managing cloud operations.",

      "answer": "IBM faces significant cybersecurity risks that could result in unauthorized access, data breaches, and reputational damage, all of which could deter potential customers and harm its competitive position. The company acknowledges that responding to and remediating cybersecurity incidents could be costly. Meanwhile, Broadcom (AVGO) spends significant resources to protect its intellectual property (IP), including monitoring unauthorized use and enforcing IP rights through litigation, which could harm relationships with customers and deter future customer acquisition. AVGO also faces potential loss of revenue from unenforceable IP rights or expired patents. Based on AVGO\u2019s significant expenditures to monitor and protect IP and IBM\u2019s acknowledgment of the high cost of cybersecurity incident response, both companies face substantial financial exposure tied to these risks, which could collectively strain their ability to attract and retain customers in a competitive technology landscape.",

      "answer": "AVGO's inability to adequately protect its IP could limit the value of its technology and result in the loss of opportunities to sell or license technology to others, which could negatively impact customer retention. IBM, on the other hand, faces cybersecurity risks that could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or system failures, potentially causing loss of existing or potential customers due to damage to brand and reputation. Both companies identify risks that directly connect to customer retention challenges\u2014AVGO through IP-related business limitations and IBM through security and trust implications.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From AVGO's 10-K, it is stated that if the company cannot adequately protect its IP, it may lose the value of its technology and face limitations on selling or licensing it, which could deter future customers and harm relationships with existing ones.",
        "Step 2: From IBM's 10-K, cybersecurity incidents could lead to unauthorized access, system disruptions, or data breaches, which may expose the company to liability, regulatory action, and reputational damage, ultimately leading to loss of customers.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize that both AVGO and IBM face distinct but material risks\u2014IP protection and cybersecurity, respectively\u2014that are explicitly tied to their ability to retain customers as described in their filings."

      "answer": "Apple provides 'general safety, security and crisis management training' to its employees as part of its broader health and safety initiatives, but does not specify frequency or mandatory requirements. In contrast, Adobe requires all employees to complete 'general security awareness training annually,' with additional role-specific training mandated for engineering and security personnel. These differences suggest that while Apple integrates security training into a broader safety framework, Adobe emphasizes formalized, recurring, and role-tailored training as a core component of its cybersecurity risk management strategy.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From Apple's 10-K, extract the mention of 'general safety, security and crisis management training' provided to employees, noting the absence of specific frequency or mandatory requirements.",
        "Step 2: From Adobe's 10-K, extract the explicit requirement that all employees 'complete a general security awareness training annually,' with additional training for certain technical roles.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the two approaches to identify differences in scope, frequency, and enforcement, and evaluate how each reflects the company's broader cybersecurity risk mitigation strategy."

          "chunk_text": "## Business Seasonality and Product Introductions\n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally , new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company's net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.\n\n## Human Capital\n\nThe Company believes that its people play an important role in its success, and strives to attract, develop and retain the best talent. The Company works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members, so that its people can do the best work of their lives. A s of September 28, 2024, the Company had approximately 164,000 full-time equivalent employees.\n\n## Compensation and Benefits\n\nThe  Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the  Company's success.  The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world, including health, wellness and time away.\n\n## Growth and Development\n\nThe Company invests in resources to help its people develop and achieve their career goals. The Company offers programs through A pple University on leadership, management and influence, as well as A pple culture and values. T eam members can also take advantage of online classes for business, technical and personal development, as well as learning opportunities to support their well-being.\n\n## Workplace Practices and Policies\n\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination.\n\n## Inclusion and Diversity\n\nThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees.\n\n## Engagement\n\nThe  Company  believes  that  open  and  honest  communication  among  team  members,  managers  and  leaders  helps  create  an  open,  collaborative  work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed.  T eam members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.\n\n## Health and Safety\n\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety , security and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. A dditionally , the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers through its global security team.",

          "chunk_text": "## ITEM 1C.  CYBERSECURITY\n\n## Risk Management and Strategy\n\nAdobe has certain security processes, infrastructure, systems, policies and practices for assessing, identifying and managing risks from cybersecurity threats. We maintain an information security risk management framework for managing cybersecurity risks, priorities and projects for our products, services, infrastructure and  corporate  resources. As  part  of  our  framework,  a  cybersecurity  risk  steering  committee  meets  regularly  to  review  newly  identified  risks  and  progress  on remediating existing risks.\n\nWe conduct regular security reviews, simulations and testing, including internal and external penetration testing, vulnerability assessments and regular scans on our hosts and network devices. We review available threat intelligence, including information from industry groups and our security vendor.  We consult with third parties, including cybersecurity consultants, as part of our cybersecurity threat and risk management strategy.\n\nDepending on the environment, our risk mitigation strategies include a variety of technical, physical and operational measures designed to manage and mitigate material risks from cybersecurity threats to our systems and data. We require employees annually to complete a general security awareness training, and additional engineering and security specific training may also be required for certain positions. Further, we maintain a vendor security review program, which is designed to provide an assessment of the security practices of those third-party vendors that process Adobe non-public data or connect to our networks. We maintain an information security incident response plan designed to monitor, analyze, address, escalate and report cybersecurity incidents, and escalate certain cybersecurity incidents to members of management depending on the circumstances, including our Chief Security Officer ('CSO'), Chief Cybersecurity Legal and Privacy  Officer  ('CCPO'),  Chief  Financial  Officer,  Chief  People  Officer,  President  of  Digital  Media,  President  of  Digital  Ex perience,  G eneral  Counsel  and  Chief Executive Officer.\n\nFor a description of the risks from cybersecurity threats that may materially affect us, see the risks described in the section titled 'Risk Factors' contained in Part I, Item IA of this report, including under the headings 'Security incidents, improper access to or disclosure of our customers' data or other cybersecurity incidents may harm our reputation and materially and adversely affect our business.'\n\n## Governance\n\nOur Board of Directors (the 'Board') addresses cybersecurity risk management as part of its general oversight function. The Audit Committee of the Board (the 'Audit Committee') has oversight of enterprise risks, including risks related to cybersecurity. In this regard, the Audit Committee reviews and discusses with management the adequacy and effectiveness of our information security, technology and privacy policies and the internal controls regarding these areas. Our Audit Committee receives regular cybersecurity updates about general cybersecurity risks from our  CSO and updates about the prevention, detection, mitigation and remediation of cybersecurity incidents from our CSO and CCPO. Cybersecurity updates presented to the Audit Committee are reported to the Board by the Audit Committee Chair. We also have a Cyber Disclosure Committee, comprised of cross-functional leaders including finance, risk, operations and investor relations and led by the CSO and CCPO, that meets to assess certain incidents and makes determinations regarding materiality. Additionally, our CSO and CCPO identify certain cybersecurity risks that are reviewed as part of the enterprise risk management framework and presented to the Board and the Audit Committee on an annual basis.\n\nOur cybersecurity risk assessment and management processes are implemented and maintained by certain management members, including our CSO and CCPO, whom each has extensive cybersecurity experience in their respective areas of responsibility and expertise. Our  CSO, who reports to the  Chief  Financial Officer, has primary responsibility for hiring appropriate information security personnel and managing workloads of information security personnel, engaging and overseeing third-party cybersecurity consultants, approving budgets and cybersecurity processes, preparing for incident response, reviewing security assessments and  other  security-related  reports,  communicating  key  priorities  to  relevant  personnel,  including  the  security  incident  response  team,  assessing  and  managing Adobe's overall cybersecurity strategy, standards, risk management (in consultation with the cybersecurity risk steering committee) and processes. Our CCPO, who reports to the G eneral  Counsel, has primary responsibility for the legal aspects of the cybersecurity program, including assessing and providing advice on our cybersecurity strategy, standards, risk management, policies, processes and legal obligations. Our CSO and CCPO are supported by a cybersecurity team comprised of cybersecurity, information security, information technology, operations and legal executives and professionals.\n\n## Table of Contents",

      "question": "How would a $50 million potential decrease in ADBE's unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12 months affect its assessment of tax provision adequacy, and how does this compare with AAPL's approach to evaluating the sufficiency of its tax reserves in light of ongoing tax examinations?",
      "answer": "A $50 million potential decrease in ADBE's unrecognized tax benefits suggests that some previously uncertain tax positions may be resolved within the next year. This would likely result in a corresponding adjustment to ADBE's tax provision, indicating that its prior reserves were potentially overstated, or that the resolution of audits has clarified the adequacy of its tax reserves. This directly supports ADBE's assertion that it regularly assesses the likelihood of outcomes from tax examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. Similarly, AAPL also evaluates the likelihood of adverse outcomes from tax examinations to determine the adequacy of its tax provision, though AAPL does not specify a quantitative estimate of potential changes. Both companies thus use ongoing assessments of audit outcomes to guide the sufficiency of their tax reserves, but ADBE provides a specific dollar amount of potential change, while AAPL offers a more qualitative evaluation.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source ADBE - 'it is reasonably possible that the underlying unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to $50 million over the next 12 months.'",

        "Step 4: Synthesize - ADBE provides a specific dollar estimate of potential tax reserve changes, while AAPL discusses the qualitative process for determining tax provision adequacy. Both companies use audit outcome assessments to evaluate tax reserves, making this a comparative multi-hop analysis."

The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company's effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company's taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## General Risks\n\n## The price of the Company's stock is subject to volatility.\n\nThe Company's stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. A dditionally , the Company , the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies' operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock's price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability . The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company's Board of Directors (the 'Board'), and the Company's share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability , div idends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company's stock may decline significantly , which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.\n\n## Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments\n\nNone.\n\n## Item 1C.    Cybersecurity\n\nThe Company's management, led by its Head of Corporate Information Security , has overall responsibility for identifying, assessing and managing any material risks from cybersecurity threats. The Company's Head of Corporate Information Security leads a dedicated Information Security team of highly skilled individuals with experience across industries that, among other things, develops and distributes information security policies, standards and procedures; engages in employee cybersecurity training; implements security controls; assesses security risk and compliance posture; monitors and responds to security events; and executes security testing and assessments. The Company's Head of Corporate Information Security has extensive knowledge and skills gained from over 25 years of experience in the cybersecurity industry , including serving in leadership positions at other large technology companies and leading the Company's Information Security team since 2016.\n\nThe Company's Information Security team coordinates with teams across the Company to prevent, respond to and manage security incidents, and engages third parties, as appropriate, to assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of its security processes and incident response. A  dedicated Supplier Trust team manages information security risks the Company is exposed to through its supplier relationships. The Company has processes to log, track, address, and escalate for further assessment and report, as appropriate, cybersecurity incidents across the Company and its suppliers to senior management and the A udit and Finance Committee (the 'A udit Committee') of the Board. The Company's enterprise risk management program is designed to identify , assess, and monitor the Company's business risks, including financial, operational, compliance and reputational risks, and reflects management's assessment of cybersecurity risks.\n\nThe Audit Committee assists the Board in the oversight and monitoring of cybersecurity matters. The A udit Committee regularly reviews and discusses the Company's cybersecurity risks with management, including the Company's Head of Corporate Information Security , its General Counsel and the Heads of Compliance and Business Conduct, Business A ssurance, and Internal A udit, and receives updates, as necessary , regarding cybersecurity incidents. The Chair of the A udit Committee regularly reports the substance of such reviews and discussions to the Board, as necessary , and recommends to the Board such actions as the Audit Committee deems appropriate.\n\nFor a discussion of the Company's cybersecurity-related risks, see Item 1A  of this Form 10-K under the heading 'Risk Factors.'\n\nApple Inc. | 2024 F orm  10-K | 17",

These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of our tax assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Although the timing of resolution, settlement and closing of audits is not certain, it is reasonably possible that the underlying unrecognized tax  benefits may decrease by up to $50 million over the next 12 months.\n\nOur future effective tax rates may be materially affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in or interpretation of tax  rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, or unexpected changes in business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits.\n\nIn addition, tax  laws in the United States as well as other countries and jurisdictions in which we conduct business are subject to change as new laws are passed  and/or  new  interpretations  are  made  available.  These  countries,  governmental  bodies,  such  as  the  European  Commission  of  the  European  Union,  and intergovernmental  economic  organizations,  such  as  the  Organization  for  Economic  Cooperation  and  Development,  have  made  or  could  make  unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined and, in some cases, have proposed or enacted new laws that are contrary to the way in which rules and regulations have historically been interpreted and applied. Changes in our operating landscape, such as changes in laws and/or interpretations of tax rules, could adversely affect our effective tax  rates and/or cause us to respond by making changes to our business structure which could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\n\nMoreover, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by domestic and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from these examinations.  Our  policy  is  to  record  interest  and  penalties  related  to  unrecognized  tax   benefits  in  income  tax   ex pense.  While  we  believe  our  tax   estimates  are reasonable, we cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\n\n## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\n## Cash Flows\n\nOur primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. Other customary sources of cash include proceeds from maturities and sales of short-term investments. Our primary uses of cash are general business expenses including payroll and related benefits costs, income taxes, marketing and third-party hosting services, as well as our stock repurchase program as described below. Other customary uses of cash include purchases of property and equipment and payments for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards.\n\nThis data should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\n",

      "answer": "Accenture's 2022 Sales and marketing expense was $6,108,401, Oracle's was $448 million. Combined, this totals $6,556,401 in Sales and marketing expenses. Accenture's 2022 revenue was $61,594,305 and Oracle's was $42,541 million (sum of Cloud services and license support, Hardware, and Services), giving a total combined revenue of $104,135,305. Sales and marketing expenses represented 6.3% of total combined revenues. Accenture's operating income was $9,367,181 and Oracle's was $14,800 million, showing that Sales and marketing expenses were significant but lower than their combined operating income of $24,167,181.",

During fiscal 2022, we invested $1.1 billion in continuous learning and development so our people remain highly relevant. With our digital learning platform, we delivered over 40 million training hours, an increase of 27% compared with fiscal 2021, with an average of approximately 61 hours of training per person. We have skills data for our people, enabling us to flexibly respond to shifting client needs while also recommending skill-specific training based on an individual's interests. We are also focused on rigorous, job-specific training through key industry certifications and partnerships with leading universities around the globe. We also train our people in inclusion and diversity.\n\nWe promoted approximately 157,000 people in fiscal 2022, demonstrating our continued commitment to creating vibrant careers and opportunities for our people.\n\nWe balance our supply of skills with changes in client demand. We do this through adjusting levels of new hiring and managing our attrition (both voluntary and involuntary). We believe people are drawn to our strong purpose, values and reputation. During fiscal 2022, we experienced a competitive labor market with high demand for the skills our people have, which contributed to elevated levels of voluntary attrition. For fiscal 2022, attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, was 19%, up from 14% in fiscal 2021. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, was 20%, flat with 20% in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2022, we increased our workforce by approximately 100,000 people.\n\nAccenture's total rewards consist of cash compensation, equity and a wide range of benefits. Our total rewards program is designed to recognize our people's skills, contributions and career progression. Base salary, bonus and equity are tailored to the market where our people work and live. Certain rewards, like equity and bonuses, are opportunities for our people to share in the overall success of our company. As our people advance in their careers, they have greater opportunities to be rewarded. Accenture's equitable rewards go beyond financial rewards and include health and well-being programs that care for our people.\n\n## The Way We Do Business\n\nAt Accenture, our people care deeply about doing the right thing. Together, we have proven that we can succeed-providing value to our clients and shareholders and opportunities for our people-while being a powerful force for good. Our shared commitment to operating with the highest ethical standards and making a positive difference in everything we do is what we believe differentiates Accenture. We believe in transparency, that transparency builds trust, and that we must earn the trust of our clients, our people, our partners and our communities each and every day.\n\nOur Code of Business Ethics is organized into six fundamental behaviors: Make Your Conduct Count; Comply with Laws; Deliver for Our Clients; Protect People, Information and Our Business; Run Our Business Responsibly; and Be a Good Corporate Citizen. It applies to all our people-regardless of their title or location. With our Code of Business Ethics, we want to help our people make ethical behavior a natural part of what we do every day-with each other, our clients, our partners and our communities.\n\nAccenture's commitment to and focus on our people and culture has generated significant recognition, including No. 1 on the Refinitiv Diversity &amp; Inclusion Index for the third time in five years; Ethisphere's World's Most Ethical Companies for 15 consecutive years; and being named a Top 10 Great Place to Work\u00ae for 2022 in nine countries, representing 76% of our people.\n\n## Our Health, Safety and Well-Being\n\nWe are committed to creating a place where people can be successful both professionally and personally. We take a holistic view of well-being-including physical, mental, emotional and financial well-being-providing specially defined programs and practices to meet our people's fundamental human needs. During fiscal 2022, our people have embraced omni-connected ways of working. According to a survey, 85% of our global respondents feel empowered to work flexibly within their teams.\n\nWe also continued to elevate our support for the well-being of our people with digital tools and initiatives to help them cope and to strengthen their mental resilience. Those programs include access to in-person and virtual counseling and support, to digital tools like Calm and Wysa, to our Mental Health Ally program and to our many Thrive Global programs, which collectively bring science-based solutions to lower stress, enhance well-being and productivity, and build resilience and belonging. Specifically relating to COVID-19, our people continue to benefit from the robust support established since the beginning of the pandemic.",

Employee satisfaction on the importance of D&amp;I at Oracle and their manager's encouragement of diverse ideas and perspectives ranks high in our employee engagement surveys.\n\nWe are proud to be recognized for our progress and commitment to D&amp;I, including being named a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality in 2022 by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, a 2021 Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion by the Disability Equality  Index,  and  a  2022  Top  Supporter  of  Historically  Black  College  and  University  Engineering  Schools  by  Career Communications Group.\n\n## Leaders Who Listen\n\nWe believe that an important aspect of creating a culture and environment that supports employee, customer and business success is listening to employee feedback. We share the results of our annual employee engagement survey with leaders who receive direct observations from employees about areas critical to Oracle's strategic priorities, including the employee and customer experience. The results of the survey are also discussed with our Board of Directors and Board committees. Nearly 80% of our employees participate  in  the  annual  survey.  Leaders  listen  to  employees,  evaluate  feedback  and  prioritize  actions  to  enhance  employee, business and customer success.\n\n## Employee Experience\n\nEmerging  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  Oracle  has  further  increased  our  focus  on  delivering  a  great  employee  experience, anchored by meaningful work, career opportunities and well-being, to continue to attract and retain high quality talent. We support employee well-being from multiple dimensions, including economic, health, development, and lifestyle with a comprehensive suite of compensation, benefits, learning and development, and flexible work options.\n\n## Opportunities to Learn and Grow\n\nWe believe that one of the primary reasons candidates join Oracle is for career development and opportunities to grow their careers. We have programs and resources to help our employees explore, build and achieve their career goals. We also promote regular career conversations between leaders and employees. These are separate from performance feedback conversations and are focused on helping employees identify and take steps to grow their careers. Our Talent Review process, run on Oracle Fusion Cloud HCM, provides the mechanism for leaders to review and discuss opportunities and action plans to develop employees. 24% of our open non-entry level positions were filled internally in fiscal 2022, providing growth opportunities and retaining critical knowledge and talent.\n\nHelping our employees learn and apply new skills is key to retaining them and critical to our ability to innovate and rapidly evolve. We support employees with anytime, everywhere learning resources to help build skills for today and the future. Oracle employees received two million hours of training in fiscal 2022 and accessed online learning content at an average rate of more than two million views per month. Our employees take advantage of online classes and learning resources on business and technical skills, as well as webinars and learning opportunities that are designed to support employee and family well-being.\n\n## Flexible Work Options\n\nFor the vast majority of Oracle's employees, productivity is not tied to being in an office and collaboration can happen between people  anywhere.  Oracle's  modern  approach  to  work  gives  our  employees  more  flexibility  to  choose  where  and  how  to  work. Depending on their role, many of our employees can choose their office location, as well as work from home some or all of the time. We believe this allows us to engage with a wider pool of talent and retain employees who want or need more flexibility.",

The amount of revenues recognized during the year ended May 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, that were included in the opening deferred revenues balance as of May 31, 2021 and 2020,  respectively,  was  approximately  $8.8  billion  and  $8.0  billion,  respectively.  Revenues  recognized  from  performance obligations satisfied in prior periods and impairment losses recognized on our receivables were immaterial during each year ended May 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\nRemaining performance obligations represent contracted revenues that had not yet been recognized, and include deferred revenues; invoices that have been issued to customers but were uncollected and have not been recognized as revenues; and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenues in future periods. The volumes and amounts of customer contracts that we book and total revenues  that  we  recognize  are  impacted  by  a  variety  of  seasonal  factors.  In  each  fiscal  year,  the  amounts  and  volumes  of contracting activity and our total revenues are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter. These  seasonal  impacts  influence  how  our  remaining  performance  obligations  change  over  time  and,  combined  with  foreign exchange rate fluctuations and other factors, influence the amount of remaining performance obligations that we report at a point in time. As of May 31, 2022, our remaining performance obligations were $46.6 billion, approximately 57% of which we expect to recognize as revenues over the next twelve months, 32% over the subsequent month 13 to month 36, and the remainder thereafter.\n\n## Sales of Financing Receivables\n\nWe offer certain of our customers the option to acquire certain of our cloud and license, hardware and services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis  to  financial  institutions  within  90  days  of  the  contracts'  dates  of  execution. We  record  the  transfers  of  amounts  due  from customers to financial institutions as sales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. During fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, $1.8 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, of our financing receivables were sold to financial institutions.\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805), in accounting for our acquisitions. ASC 805 requires that we evaluate whether a transaction pertains to an acquisition of assets, or to an acquisition of a business. A business is defined as an integrated  set  of  assets  and  activities  that  is  capable  of  being  conducted  and  managed  for  the  purpose  of  providing  a  return  to investors.  Asset  acquisitions  are  accounted  for  by  allocating  the  cost  of  the  acquisition  to  the  individual  assets  and  liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis; whereas the acquisition of a business requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets  acquired  and  the  liabilities  assumed  at  the  acquisition  date  fair  values.  Goodwill  as  of  the  business  acquisition  date  is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the business acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of  a  business  acquisition's  measurement  period  or  final  determination  of  the  values  of  assets  acquired  or  liabilities  assumed, whichever  comes  first,  any  subsequent  adjustments  are  recorded  to  our  consolidated  statements  of  operations.  Costs  to  exit  or restructure  certain  activities  of  an  acquired  company  or  our  internal  operations  are  accounted  for  as  termination  and  exit  costs pursuant to ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations , and are accounted for separately from the business",

ACN reports a 0.8 percentage point increase from non-U.S. operations taxed at other rates. ORCL reports $536 million in tax impact from foreign earnings at other than U.S. rates, which, when normalized to its $1,606 million U.S. federal statutory tax provision, results in a 33.4% effective foreign tax differential (i.e., $536M / $1,606M), or approximately 2.1 percentage points below the U.S. federal statutory rate. These foreign operation effects must be interpreted in the context of other adjustments: ACN reports a 3.0 percentage point increase from other net activity in unrecognized tax benefits and a 3.0 percentage point reduction from excess tax benefits from share-based payments. ORCL reports a $263 million net benefit from settlements and releases and a $441 million expense from domestic tax contingencies, indicating contrasting directional adjustments of $704 million total in offsetting impacts.",

Net cash provided by operating activities can be significantly impacted by factors such as growth in new business, timing of cash receipts from customers, vendor payment terms and timing of payments to vendors. Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2025 was further benefited by the changes in unearned revenue of $1.6 billion and accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities of $1.1 billion, partially offset by the changes in costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts, net of $2.1 billion, prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets of $1.5 billion and accounts receivable, net of $490 million. As our business continues to grow, and assuming our expenses remain in line with or less than our revenue growth, we expect to continue to see growth in net cash provided by operating activities.\n\nThe net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2024 was primarily comprised of net income of $4.1 billion, adjusted for non-cash items, including $4.0 billion of depreciation and amortization and $2.8 billion of stock-based compensation expense.

AVGO paid $9,814 million in dividends, reflecting a strong commitment to returning value to shareholders even amid significant debt obligations. In contrast, CRM paid $1,537 million in dividends, signaling a more conservative approach to shareholder returns, possibly due to its focus on reinvesting in growth areas such as cloud computing and customer relationship management solutions.",

        "Step 5: Analyze CRM's approach - CRM's smaller dividend payment suggests a more growth-oriented strategy, with a focus on reinvesting in its expanding cloud and CRM platforms.",
        "Step 6: Synthesize - The combined total of $11,351 million reflects differing capital allocation strategies: AVGO focusing on shareholder returns and CRM on growth reinvestment."

        "Step 3: Calculate the combined total - Apple's $45,888 million + Accenture's $939.198 million = $46,827.198 million.",

      "answer": "Apple reports $10,046 million in other non-current liabilities related to operating leases and $752 million for finance leases, totaling $10,798 million in long-term lease obligations. Accenture reports $2,369,490 thousand in other non-current liabilities for leases, which represents a much smaller proportion of its total non-current liabilities ($7,787,988 thousand). This indicates Apple maintains a significantly larger long-term lease obligation footprint relative to its overall capital structure compared to Accenture.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Apple's other non-current liabilities include $10,046 million for operating leases and $752 million for finance leases as of 2024.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Accenture's other non-current liabilities include $2,369,490 thousand for leases as part of total non-current liabilities of $7,787,988 thousand.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Apple's lease-related non-current liabilities are significantly higher in both absolute value and relative proportion to its overall capital structure compared to Accenture, suggesting differing approaches to long-term liability management."

We have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, and our recent financial results reflect the success of these investments.\n\nDigital Experience revenue was $3.87 billion in fiscal 2021, up from $3.13 billion in fiscal 2020 which represents 24% yearover-year growth. Driving this increase was the increase in subscription revenue across our offerings which grew to $3.38 billion in fiscal 2021 from $2.66 billion in fiscal 2020, representing 27% year-over-year growth. Also contributing to the increase in Digital Experience subscription revenue was revenue associated with Workfront's workflow platform offerings. We expect that the addition of Workfront, and continued demand across our portfolio of Digital Experience solutions, will drive revenue growth in future years.\n\n## COVID-19 UPDATE\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to have widespread, rapidly-evolving and unpredictable impacts on global societies, economies, financial markets and business practices. As conditions fluctuate around the world, with vaccine administration rising in certain regions, governments and organizations have responded by adjusting their restrictions and guidelines accordingly. Our focus remains on promoting employee health and safety, serving our customers and ensuring business continuity. We carefully assess, and reassess,  conditions on a case-by-case basis to determine when employees can safely return to our offices and resume business travel. As  a  result,  we  have  reopened  our  offices  in  areas  with  sustained  low  infection  rates  and  are  allowing  fully  vaccinated employees to return on a voluntary basis. In addition, we are implementing our reimagined framework for the future of work at Adobe, which is rooted in a flexible and hybrid model enabled by a digital-first mindset.\n\nDuring the pandemic, digital has become the primary way for people to connect, work, learn and be entertained, and for businesses to engage with customers. This ongoing shift to a digital-first world has increased the importance and relevance of our solutions, which has contributed to our continued growth year over year. However, while our revenue and earnings are relatively predictable as a result of our subscription-based business model, the duration of the pandemic and the broader implications of the macro-economic recovery on our business remain uncertain. See the section titled 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A of this report for further discussion of the possible impact of the pandemic on our business.\n\n## Financial Performance Summary for Fiscal 2021\n\nOur financial results for fiscal 2021 benefited from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to our 52/53 week financial calendar whereby fiscal 2021 is a 53-week year compared with fiscal 2020 and 2019 which were 52-week years.\n\n- Total Digital Media ARR of approximately $12.24 billion as of December 3, 2021 increased by $1.98 billion, or 19%, from $10.26 billion as of November 27, 2020. The change in our Digital Media ARR was primarily due to new user adoption of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings.\n- Creative revenue of $9.55 billion increased by $1.81 billion, or 23%, during fiscal 2021, from $7.74 billion in fiscal 2020. Document Cloud revenue of $1.97 billion increased by $477 million, or 32%, during fiscal 2021, from $1.50 billion  in  fiscal  2020. The  increases  were  primarily  due  to  subscription  revenue  growth associated with our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings.\n- Digital Experience revenue of $3.87 billion increased by $742 million, or 24%, during fiscal 2021, from $3.13 billion in fiscal  2020. The increase was primarily due to subscription revenue growth across our offerings, including from our Workfront acquisition.\n- Remaining performance obligations of $13.99 billion as of December 3, 2021 increased by $2.65 billion, or 23%, from $11.34 billion as of November 27, 2020, primarily due to new contracts and renewals for our Digital Media and Digital Experience offerings, as well as impacts from our Workfront acquisition.\n- Cost of revenue of $1.87 billion increased by $143 million, or 8%, during fiscal 2021, from $1.72 billion in fiscal 2020 primarily due to increases in hosting services and data center costs, partially offset by decreases in Advertising Cloud media costs.\n- Operating expenses of $8.12 billion increased by $1.21 billion, or 17%, during fiscal 2021, from $6.91 billion in fiscal 2020 primarily  due  to  increases  in  base  and  incentive  compensation  and  related  benefits  costs,  as  well  as  increased marketing spend.",

          "chunk_text": "\nGraphics  Graphics  segment  revenue  increased  by  61%  in  fiscal  year  2022  compared  to  fiscal  year  2021.  We continue to benefit from strong demand for NVIDIA Ampere architecture products, and believe the increase in Gaming revenue during  fiscal  year  2022  resulted  from  a  combination  of  factors,  including:  the  ramp  of  new  RTX  30  Series GPUs; the release of new games supporting ray tracing; the rising popularity of gaming, esports, content creation and streaming; the demand for new and upgraded systems to support the increase in remote work; and the ability of end users to engage in cryptocurrency mining.\n\nCompute &amp; Networking Compute &amp; Networking segment revenue increased by 61% in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021, driven primarily by sales of NVIDIA Ampere architecture products to hyperscale customers for cloud computing and workloads such as natural language processing and deep recommender models, as well as to vertical industries. The increase compared to fiscal year 2021 also reflects the strong sales of networking products and that fiscal year 2022 includes a full year of networking revenue as Mellanox was acquired in April 2020. CMP contributed $550 million in fiscal year 2022 compared to an insignificant amount in the prior year.\n\n## Concentration of Revenue\n\nRevenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 84% and 81% of total revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location  to  which  the  products  are  initially  billed  even  if  the  revenue  is  attributable  to  end  customers  in  a  different location.\n\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021.\n\n## Gross Profit and Gross Margin\n\nGross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost  of  semiconductors,  including  wafer  fabrication,  assembly,  testing  and  packaging,  board  and  device  costs, manufacturing  support  costs,  including  labor  and  overhead  associated  with  such  purchases,  final  test  yield  fallout, inventory  and  warranty  provisions,  memory  and  component  costs,  tariffs,  and  shipping  costs.  Cost  of  revenue  also includes  acquisition-related  costs,  development  costs  for  license  and  service  arrangements,  IP-related  costs,  and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing.\n\nOur overall gross margin was 64.9% and 62.3% for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in fiscal year 2022  was  primarily  due  to  lower  Mellanox  acquisition-related  charges,  including  a  non-recurring  inventory  step-up charge of $161 million in fiscal year 2021. The increase also benefited from a higher-end mix within Graphics, partially offset by a mix shift within Compute &amp; Networking.\n\nInventory  provisions  totaled  $354  million  and  $116  million  for  fiscal  years  2022  and  2021,  respectively.  Sales  of inventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $111 million and $145 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 0.9% in fiscal year 2022 and insignificant in fiscal year 2021.\n\nThe gross  margin  of  our  Graphics  segment  increased  during  fiscal  year  2022  when  compared  to  fiscal  year  2021, primarily due to higher-end mix within GeForce GPUs.\n\nThe gross margin of our Compute &amp; Networking segment decreased during fiscal year 2022 when compared to fiscal year  2021,  primarily  due  to  a  shift  in  product  mix  and  partially  offset  by  a  reduced  contribution  from  Automotive solutions.",

How did Microsoft's impairments of $81 million on these securities specifically contribute to this divergence in financial outcomes, and what does this reveal about their respective portfolio management strategies?",
      "answer": "Cisco's $9 million realized gain contrasts with Microsoft's $57 million loss, which was significantly influenced by Microsoft's $81 million in impairments and allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale securities. This impairment amount exceeded Microsoft's realized gains ($162 million) by more than 50%, turning what would have been a net gain into a substantial net loss. In contrast, Cisco's smaller realized gain and limited losses suggest a more conservative or stable portfolio management approach. The difference in outcomes highlights divergent strategies: Microsoft's portfolio was more exposed to credit risk and value erosion, while Cisco's was more balanced or less volatile.",

          "chunk_text": "## CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 1. Basis of Presentation\n\nThe fiscal year for Cisco Systems, Inc. (the 'Company,' 'Cisco,' 'we,' 'us,' or 'our') is the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the last Saturday  in  July.  Fiscal  2022  and  fiscal  2020  were  each  52-week  fiscal  years,  and  fiscal  2021  was  a  53-week  fiscal  year.  The Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts and those of our subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have  been  eliminated.  We  conduct  business  globally  and  are  primarily  managed  on  a  geographic  basis  in  the  following  three geographic segments: the Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific, Japan, and China (APJC).\n\nOur consolidated financial statements include our accounts and investments consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. The noncontrolling interests attributed to these investments are not presented as a separate component in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets as these amounts are not material for any of the fiscal periods presented. The share of earnings attributable  to  the  noncontrolling  interests  are  not  presented  separately  in  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations  as  these amounts are not material for any of the fiscal periods presented.\n\nCertain reclassifications have been made to the amounts for prior years in order to conform to the current year's presentation. We have evaluated subsequent events through the date that the financial statements were issued.\n\n## 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n(a) Cash and Cash Equivalents   We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with various financial institutions.\n\n(b)  Available-for-Sale  Debt  Investments      We  classify  our  investments  in  fixed  income  securities  as  available-for-sale  debt investments.  Our  available-for-sale  debt  investments  primarily  consist  of  U.S.  government,  U.S.  government  agency,  non-U.S. government and agency, corporate debt, and U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities. These available-for-sale debt investments are primarily held in the custody of a major financial institution. A specific identification method is used to determine the cost basis of available-for-sale  debt  investments  sold.  These  investments  are  recorded  in  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets  at  fair  value. Unrealized  gains  and  losses  on  these  investments  are  included  as  a  separate  component  of  accumulated  other  comprehensive income (AOCI), net of tax. We classify our investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.\n\n(c) Equity Instruments Our equity investments are accounted for as follows:\n\n- Marketable equity securities have readily determinable fair value (RDFV) that are measured and recorded at fair value through income.\n- Non-marketable equity securities do not have RDFV and are measured using a measurement alternative recorded at cost less  any  impairment,  plus  or  minus  changes  resulting  from  qualifying  observable  price  changes.  For  certain  of  these securities, we have elected to apply the net asset value (NAV) practical expedient. The NAV is the estimated fair value of these investments.\n- Equity method investments are securities we do not control, but are able to exert significant influence over the investee. These investments are measured at cost less any impairment, plus or minus our share of equity method investee income or loss.\n\n(d) Impairments of Investments   For our available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists. In this assessment, among other factors, we consider the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost,  any  changes  to  the  rating  of  the  security  by  a  rating  agency,  and  adverse  conditions  specifically  related  to  the  security.  If factors indicate a credit loss exists, an allowance for credit loss is recorded to other income (loss), net, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. The amount of fair value change relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI).\n\nWe hold non-marketable  equity  and  other  investments  ('privately  held  investments')  which  are  included  in  other  assets  in  the Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  We  monitor  these  investments  for  impairments  and  make  reductions  in  carrying  values  if  we determine  that  an  impairment  charge  is  required  based  primarily  on  the  financial  condition  and  near-term  prospects  of  these companies.",

      "answer": "Cisco (CSCO) highlights the risk of increased HR costs due to potential difficulties in retaining and attracting key technical and managerial personnel, especially in competitive markets like Silicon Valley. The company notes that volatility in stock prices or changes to equity compensation programs could lead to increased hiring in international locations, which may further increase HR costs due to exchange rate risks. In contrast, Microsoft (MSFT) systematically allocates corporate-level HR expenses to its business segments based on identifiable benefits received, ensuring that costs are distributed in alignment with the relative value and profitability of each segment. This reflects a more centralized and structured cost management strategy for human capital, as opposed to Cisco's exposure to external market risks affecting HR costs.",

There can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred. Although these losses have not been material to date, future losses, if incurred, could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Additionally, to the degree that turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing, those customers' ability to pay could be adversely impacted, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\n\n## We  are  exposed  to  fluctuations  in  the  market  values  of  our  portfolio  investments  and  in  interest  rates;  impairment  of  our investments could harm our earnings.\n\nWe  maintain  an  investment  portfolio  of  various  holdings,  types,  and  maturities.  Our  portfolio  includes  available-for-sale  debt investments and equity investments, the values of which are subject to market price volatility. If such investments suffer market price declines, as we experienced with some of our investments in the past, we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis. Our privately held investments are subject to risk of loss of investment capital. These  investments  are  inherently  risky  because  the  markets  for  the  technologies  or  products  they  have  under  development  are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies. For information regarding  the  market  risks  associated  with  the  fair  value  of  portfolio  investments  and  interest  rates,  refer  to  the  section  titled 'Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.'\n\n## We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows.\n\nBecause a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the United States, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, including emerging market currencies which can have extreme currency volatility. An increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the United States where  we  sell  in  dollars  and  a  weakened  dollar  could  increase  the  cost  of  local  operating  expenses  and  procurement  of  raw materials to the extent that we must purchase components in foreign currencies. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows.\n\n## Failure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objectives.\n\nOur success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, managerial, sales, and marketing personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California. Stock incentive plans are designed to reward employees for their long-term contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us. Volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or equity incentive awards, or changes to our overall compensation program, including our stock incentive program, resulting from the management of share dilution and share-based compensation expense or otherwise, may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees. As a result of one or more of these factors, we may  increase  our  hiring  in  geographic  areas  outside  the  United  States,  which  could  subject  us  to  additional  geopolitical  and exchange rate risk. The loss of services of any of our key personnel; the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future;  or  delays  in  hiring  required  personnel,  particularly  engineering  and  sales  personnel,  could  make  it  difficult  to  meet  key objectives,  such  as  timely  and  effective  product  introductions.  In  addition,  companies  in  our  industry  whose  employees  accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring practices. We have received these claims in the past and may receive additional claims to this effect in the future.\n\n## Adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm our operating results or financial condition.\n\nWe are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business. Additionally, there are existing claims and lawsuits in Russia, and the  potential  for  future  claims  and  lawsuits  in  Russia  and/or  Belarus,  related  to  the  Russia  and  Ukraine  war  and  related  trade restrictions and sanctions. In the event of an unfavorable resolution of any of these lawsuits, the potential outcome could include the seizure of our assets in Russia and/or Belarus, which, collectively, represents less than 0.1% of our total assets at the end of fiscal 2022. Litigation can be costly, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. An unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition. For additional information regarding certain of the matters in which we are involved, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, subsection (f) 'Legal Proceedings.'\n\n## Our  operating  results  may  be  adversely  affected  and  damage  to  our  reputation  may  occur  due  to  production  and  sale  of counterfeit versions of our products.\n\nAs is the case with leading products around the world, our products are subject to efforts by third parties to produce counterfeit versions of our products. While we work diligently with law enforcement authorities in various countries to block the manufacture of  counterfeit  goods  and  to  interdict  their  sale,  and  to  detect  counterfeit  products  in  customer  networks,  and  have  succeeded  in prosecuting counterfeiters and their distributors, resulting in fines, imprisonment and restitution to us, there can be no guarantee that such efforts will succeed.

A s we expand our services and solutions into these new areas, we may be exposed to operational, legal, regulatory, ethical, technological and other risks specific to such new areas, which may negatively affect our reputation and demand for our services and solutions.\n\nTechnological developments may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients and, in the case of cloud, data and A I solutions, could affect the nature of how we generate revenue. Some of these technological developments have reduced and replaced, in whole or in part, some of our historical services and solutions and will continue to do so in the future. This has caused, and may in the future cause, clients to delay spending under existing contracts and engagements and to delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate new technologies. Such technological developments and spending delays can negatively impact our results of operations if we are unable to introduce new pricing or commercial models that reflect the value of these technological developments or if the pace and level of spending on new technologies are not sufficient to make up any shortfall.\n\nDevelopments in the industries we serve, which may be rapid, also could shift demand to new services and solutions. If, as a result of new technologies or changes in the industries we serve, our clients demand new services and solutions, we may be less competitive in these new areas or need to make significant investment to meet that demand. Our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation and making strategic investments in acquisitions, joint ventures and adjacencies to our current offerings that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas. If we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and adapt to industry developments, or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale, or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation, our services and solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and to execute on our growth strategy could be adversely affected.\n\nIn a particular geographic market, service or industry group, a small number of clients have contributed, or may, in the future contribute, a significant portion of the revenues of such geographic market, service or industry group, and any decision by such a client to delay, reduce, or eliminate spending on our services and solutions have had and could in the future have a disproportionate impact on the results of operations in the relevant geographic market, service or industry group.\n\nMany of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration, and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days' notice. Longer-term, larger and more complex contracts, such as the majority of our managed services contracts, generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us, but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated ongoing revenues and profits lost upon termination of the contract. M any of our contracts allow clients to terminate, delay, reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide. A dditionally, a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project, try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work. When contracts are terminated or not renewed, we lose the anticipated revenues, and it may take significant time to replace the level of rev enues lost. Consequently, our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected. The specific business or financial condition of a client, changes in management and changes in a client's strategy are also all factors that can result in terminations, cancellations or delays.\n\n## Risks and uncertainties related to the development and use of A I could harm our business, damage our reputation or give rise to legal or regulatory action.\n\nWe are increasingly applying A I-based technologies, including generative A I, to our services and solutions, to how we deliver work to our clients, and to our own internal operations. In addition, we are creating new offerings to implement A I solutions for clients. We have made significant investments in A I and are continuing to incur significant development and operational costs to develop and deploy our A I services and solutions for ourselves and for our clients. If we fail to continue to develop leading AI services and solutions, including generative A I, we may lose our leadership position in this area and fail to realize the anticipated benefits of our investments in AI.\n\nAI technologies are complex and rapidly evolving, and we face significant competition, including from our own clients, who may develop their own internal A I-related capabilities, which can lead to reduced demand for our services or solutions. A s these technologies evolve, some services and tasks currently performed by our people will be replaced by automation, including A I-enabled solutions, which will lead to reduced demand for our services and/or adversely affect the utilization rate of our professionals, if demand for those services is not replaced by demand for new services. Leveraging A I capabilities for our internal functions and operations presents additional risks, costs, and challenges, including those discussed in these risk factors.\n\nThe development, adoption, and use of AI technologies is still in the early stages and involve significant risks and uncertainties, which may expose us to legal, reputational and financial harm. A I algorithms and training methodologies may be flawed and datasets may be overbroad, insufficient, or contain biased information. M oreover, the use of A I may give rise to risks related to harmful content, accuracy, bias, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, defamation, data privacy, cybersecurity and health and safety, among others, and also bring the possibility of new or enhanced governmental",

Risk Factors\n\nSet forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.\n\n## Risks Related to our Business and Industry\n\n## Our operations can be difficult to predict because our operating results may fluctuate in future periods.\n\nOur operating results have been in the past, and will continue to be, subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors, some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment. These factors include:\n\n- Fluctuations in demand for our products and services, especially with respect to service providers and internet businesses, in part due to changes in the global economic environment\n- Changes in sales and implementation cycles for our products and reduced visibility into our customers' spending plans and associated revenue\n- Our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels and purchase commitments\n- Price and product competition in the communications and networking industries, which can change rapidly due to technological innovation and different business models from various geographic regions\n- The overall movement toward industry consolidation among both our competitors and our customers\n- The introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products, and our success in new and evolving markets, and in emerging technologies, as well as the adoption of new standards\n- Variations in sales channels, product costs, mix of products sold, or mix of direct sales and indirect sales\n- The timing, size, and mix of orders from customers\n- Manufacturing and customer lead times\n- Fluctuations in our gross margins, and the factors that contribute to such fluctuations\n- The ability of our customers, channel partners, contract manufacturers and suppliers to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditures, especially during a period of global credit market disruption or in the event of customer, channel partner, contract manufacturer or supplier financial problems\n- Actual events, circumstances, outcomes, and amounts differing from judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in determining the values of certain assets (including the amounts of related valuation allowances), liabilities, and other items reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements\n- How well we execute on our strategy and operating plans and the impact of changes in our business model that could result in significant restructuring charges\n- Our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions\n- Benefits anticipated from our investments\n- Changes in tax laws or accounting rules, or interpretations thereof\n\nAs a consequence, operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict, and, therefore, prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. Any of the foregoing factors, or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein, could materially harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\n## Our operating results may be negatively impacted by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment.\n\nChallenging economic conditions, including rising inflation, or other changes, worldwide have from time to time contributed, and may continue to contribute, to slowdowns in the communications and networking industries at large, as well as in specific segments and markets in which we operate, resulting in: reduced demand for our products as a result of continued constraints on IT-related capital spending by our customers, particularly service provider and cloud as well as enterprise and other customer markets; increased price competition for our products, not only from our competitors but also as a consequence of customers disposing of unutilized products; risk of excess and obsolete inventories; risk of supply constraints; risk of excess facilities and manufacturing capacity; and higher overhead costs as a percentage of revenue and higher interest expense.\n\nThe  global  macroeconomic  environment  can  be  challenging  and  inconsistent.  In  certain  prior  periods,  we  have  seen  a  broad-based  weakening  in  the  global macroeconomic environment which has impacted and could impact in the future certain of our markets. Additionally, instability in the global credit markets, the impact of uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary",

Business\n\n## General\n\nCisco designs and sells a broad range of technologies that help to power, secure, and draw insights from the Internet. We are integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into our product portfolios across networking, security, collaboration and observability to simplify how our technology is delivered, managed and optimized and to help customers maximize the business value of their technology investments and accelerate their digital transformation.\n\nWe conduct our business globally and manage our business by geography. Our business is organized into the following three geographic segments: Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific, Japan, and China (APJC).\n\nOur products and technologies are grouped into the following categories: Networking, Security, Collaboration and Observability. In addition to our product offerings, we provide a broad range of services offerings, including technical support services and advanced services, also known as lifecycle services. Our customers include businesses of all sizes, public institutions, governments, and service providers, including large webscale providers. These customers often look to us as a strategic partner to help them use information technology (IT) to differentiate themselves and drive positive business outcomes.\n\nWe were  incorporated  in  California  in  1984  and  reincorporated  in  Delaware  in  2021.  Our  headquarters  are  in  San  Jose,  California.  The  mailing  address  of  our headquarters is 170 West Tasman Drive, San Jose, California 95134-1706, and our telephone number at that location is (408) 526-4000. Our website is www.cisco.com. Through a link on the Investor Relations section of our website, we make available the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) at sec.gov: our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

We also help customers navigate emerging technological shifts. Our strategy is to securely connect everything to make those desired outcomes and experiences possible for our customers.\n\nIn today's dynamic environment, our customers have three key priorities: build modern and resilient infrastructure; protect against the cyber threats of today and tomorrow; and harness the power of AI and data.\n\nThese customer priorities are central to how we innovate and develop our technology. First, we provide the underlying network connectivity for our customers, whether they are connecting traditional branch offices, data centers, smart grids, video devices, electric vehicles, or other devices. Second, we help protect those network connections and the underlying technology architecture against cyber threats. Third, through the visibility we have into data across the network, connected devices and applications, we provide context and insights to our customers about what is happening in their technology architecture, not only in their on-premise infrastructure and private data centers, but also their cloud infrastructure. Our ongoing innovation is delivered, managed and optimized through a combination of hardware, software and subscriptions, in line with the flex ible consumption models our customers request.",

This difference in classification methodologies means that Adobe's geographic revenue data may better reflect actual regional demand patterns driven by end users, whereas Texas Instruments' geographic revenue data may be more indicative of manufacturing hub activity rather than end-use demand. As a result, analysts must apply caution when interpreting regional revenue trends from each company, recognizing that Adobe's approach aligns more closely with demand-side economics, while Texas Instruments' approach reflects supply-chain logistics.",

Adobe, on the other hand, only references the composition of its cash and short-term investments as of a specific date (November 27, 2020), without disclosing any specific policies or risk management practices related to its cash investments.

We also limit counterparties on cash deposits and financial derivative contracts to financial institutions with investment-grade ratings.\n\nConcentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas. We maintain allowances for expected returns, disputes, adjustments, incentives and credit losses. These allowances are deducted from accounts receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nAccounts receivable allowances changed to reflect amounts charged (credited) to operating results by ($3) million, $3 million and ($11) million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## 6. Valuation of debt and equity investments and certain liabilities\n\n## Investments measured at fair value\n\nMoney market funds, available-for-sale debt investments and mutual funds are stated at fair value, which is generally based on market prices or broker quotes. See Fair-value considerations . Unrealized gains and losses from availablefor-sale debt securities are recorded as an increase or decrease, net of taxes, in AOCI on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and any credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities are recorded as an allowance for credit losses with an offset recognized in OI&amp;E in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nOur mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments intended to generate returns that offset changes in certain deferred compensation liabilities. We record changes in the fair value of these mutual funds and the related deferred compensation liabilities in SG&amp;A.\n\n## Other investments\n\nOur other investments include equity-method investments and non-marketable equity investments, which are not measured at fair value. These investments consist of interests in venture capital funds and other non-marketable equity securities. Gains and losses from equity-method investments are recognized in OI&amp;E based on our ownership share of the investee's financial results.\n\nNon-marketable equity securities are measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments.

      "question": "How does IBM's uncertainty in financial predictability for its cloud segment investments contrast with Oracle's reported growth trends in its cloud services revenue during fiscal 2023?",
      "answer": "IBM's 2023 filing highlights significant challenges in predicting financial outcomes for its growth areas, particularly in the cloud segment, due to factors such as market competition, evolving customer preferences, and the rapid pace of technological change. This uncertainty is compounded by the difficulty in anticipating adoption rates and establishing viable economic models in highly competitive and fast-growing cloud markets. In contrast, Oracle's 2023 filing reports a clear upward trend in cloud services revenue, which accounted for 32% of total revenue during fiscal 2023, up from 25% in fiscal 2022. Oracle's growth trajectory in the cloud segment suggests a more predictable and expanding market adoption of its cloud offerings, particularly in SaaS applications like ERP, EPM, SCM, and HCM, which are designed to reduce customer IT complexity and support flexible deployment models.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - IBM highlights difficulty in predicting financial outcomes for growth areas, especially in competitive and evolving cloud markets.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Oracle reports that cloud services revenues represented 32% of total revenue in fiscal 2023, up from 25% in fiscal 2022.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While IBM expresses uncertainty and risk in its cloud segment investments, Oracle demonstrates measurable and growing success in the same market segment, indicating divergent financial trajectories and market positioning."

      "answer": "Oracle's R&D spending increased by $350 million between FY2022 and FY2023, reflecting a growing investment in innovation. Similarly, IBM explicitly ties its long-term success to innovation initiatives, particularly in hybrid cloud, AI, and quantum computing, emphasizing that its ability to maintain market share and profit margins depends on leveraging R&D investments and building a strong developer ecosystem. While Oracle's spending data shows a measurable upward trend, IBM's 10-K underscores the strategic importance of R&D in maintaining competitive differentiation and commercializing disruptive technologies.

      "answer": "IBM highlights its investments in R&D as central to its innovation strategy, particularly in areas like hybrid cloud, AI, and quantum computing, which the company views as critical to maintaining competitive differentiation and profit margins. In contrast, Oracle explicitly excludes R&D expenses from its reported segment margins, indicating that R&D is not directly tied to the controllable performance metrics of its business units. This contrast reveals that IBM treats R&D as a strategic asset for long-term differentiation, while Oracle manages R&D as a corporate-level investment rather than a direct driver of segment profitability.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From IBM's 10-K, the company emphasizes that its R&D investments are essential for innovation in hybrid cloud, AI, and quantum computing, which are key to maintaining market share and profit margins.",
        "Step 2: From Oracle's 10-K, the company states that R&D costs are not included in segment margin calculations, suggesting that R&D is treated as a centralized, non-operational expense rather than a direct contributor to business unit performance.",
        "Step 3: Comparing these two reveals a strategic difference: IBM positions R&D as a core competitive advantage, while Oracle does not directly link R&D spending to the financial performance of its operating segments."

      "answer": "ACN faces revenue unpredictability because many of its consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration and can be terminated with as little as 30 days' notice. This creates risk because when contracts are terminated or not renewed, ACN loses anticipated revenues and may take significant time to replace them. In contrast, ADBE recognizes consulting revenue either as services are performed (for time-and-materials contracts) or on a relative performance basis (for fixed-fee contracts), which may provide more predictable revenue streams if projects are long-term or have structured performance milestones. Therefore, ACN\u2019s reliance on short-term, easily terminable contracts introduces greater volatility in revenue forecasting compared to ADBE\u2019s potentially more stable revenue recognition aligned with service delivery or project completion.",

Some of these technological developments have reduced and replaced, in whole or in part, some of our historical services and solutions and will continue to do so in the future. This has caused, and may in the future cause, clients to delay spending under existing contracts and engagements and to delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate new technologies.

Our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation and making strategic investments in acquisitions, joint ventures and adjacencies to our current offerings that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas. If we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and adapt to industry developments, or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale, or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation, our services and solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and to execute on our growth strategy could be adversely affected.\n\nIn a particular geographic market, service or industry group, a small number of clients have contributed, or may, in the future contribute, a significant portion of the revenues of such geographic market, service or industry group, and any decision by such a client to delay, reduce, or eliminate spending on our services and solutions have had and could in the future have a disproportionate impact on the results of operations in the relevant geographic market, service or industry group.\n\nMany of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration, and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days' notice. Longer-term, larger and more complex contracts, such as the majority of our managed services contracts, generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us, but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated ongoing revenues and profits lost upon termination of the contract. M any of our contracts allow clients to terminate, delay, reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide. A dditionally, a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project, try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work. When contracts are terminated or not renewed, we lose the anticipated revenues, and it may take significant time to replace the level of rev enues lost. Consequently, our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected. The specific business or financial condition of a client, changes in management and changes in a client's strategy are also all factors that can result in terminations, cancellations or delays.\n\n## Risks and uncertainties related to the development and use of A I could harm our business, damage our reputation or give rise to legal or regulatory action.\n\nWe are increasingly applying A I-based technologies, including generative A I, to our services and solutions, to how we deliver work to our clients, and to our own internal operations. In addition, we are creating new offerings to implement A I solutions for clients. We have made significant investments in A I and are continuing to incur significant development and operational costs to develop and deploy our A I services and solutions for ourselves and for our clients. If we fail to continue to develop leading AI services and solutions, including generative A I, we may lose our leadership position in this area and fail to realize the anticipated benefits of our investments in AI.\n\nAI technologies are complex and rapidly evolving, and we face significant competition, including from our own clients, who may develop their own internal A I-related capabilities, which can lead to reduced demand for our services or solutions. A s these technologies evolve, some services and tasks currently performed by our people will be replaced by automation, including A I-enabled solutions, which will lead to reduced demand for our services and/or adversely affect the utilization rate of our professionals, if demand for those services is not replaced by demand for new services. Leveraging A I capabilities for our internal functions and operations presents additional risks, costs, and challenges, including those discussed in these risk factors.\n\nThe development, adoption, and use of AI technologies is still in the early stages and involve significant risks and uncertainties, which may expose us to legal, reputational and financial harm. A I algorithms and training methodologies may be flawed and datasets may be overbroad, insufficient, or contain biased information. M oreover, the use of A I may give rise to risks related to harmful content, accuracy, bias, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, defamation, data privacy, cybersecurity and health and safety, among others, and also bring the possibility of new or enhanced governmental",
