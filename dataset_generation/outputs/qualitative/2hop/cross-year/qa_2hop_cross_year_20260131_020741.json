      "question": "How did the volume and fair value of Federal Funds Purchased & Sec Loaned change between 2023 and 2024, and what does this indicate about BAC's short-term funding strategies?",
      "answer": "In 2023, the volume of Federal Funds Purchased & Sec Loaned showed a net change of $16,466 million, indicating a significant increase in short-term funding liabilities. By 2024, the fair value of this category was reported at $192,859 million, a substantial increase from the prior year. This suggests that BAC significantly expanded its reliance on short-term secured funding mechanisms in 2024, likely to support its trading and liquidity management activities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, the volume of Federal Funds Purchased & Sec Loaned increased by $1,662 million, with a corresponding interest expense increase of $14,804 million, resulting in a net change of $16,466 million.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the fair value of Federal Funds Purchased & Sec Loaned was $192,859 million, a significant amount under the liabilities section, indicating a continued and expanded use of this funding mechanism.",
        "Step 3: The increase from a net change of $16,466 million in 2023 to a fair value of $192,859 million in 2024 indicates a transformation in BAC\u2019s short-term funding strategy, with a much greater reliance on secured funding through repurchase agreements."

      "answer": "The fair value of money market investments held by Bank of America increased from $1.2 billion at December 31, 2023, to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2024. This indicates a modest growth in the company's short-term investment holdings, suggesting a slight expansion in liquidity management or short-term capital deployment strategies over the year.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Bank of America highlighted increasing global regulatory focus on climate change, noting that new or heightened regulatory requirements across state, federal, and non-U.S. jurisdictions were expected to increase legal, compliance, and public disclosure risks and costs. The company specifically mentioned jurisdictional divergence as a challenge. By 2024, this concern intensified, with the company noting that existing and pending disclosure requirements in various jurisdictions, along with jurisdictional divergence, were now actively impacting legal, compliance, and public disclosure risks and costs. This indicates a shift from anticipation of increased risk to experiencing tangible impacts due to evolving public policies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, BAC noted that jurisdictional divergence in climate-related regulation was expected to increase compliance and disclosure risks and costs.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, BAC reported that these risks had materialized, with existing and pending disclosure requirements across jurisdictions actively increasing legal and compliance risks.",
        "Step 3: The evolution reflects a transition from anticipating regulatory changes to facing their real-world implications, indicating a transformation in how public policies are impacting the company."

Regardless  of  the  steps  we  take  to  design effective  controls,  governance,  monitoring  and  testing,  and  implement  new technology and automated processes, we could suffer operational, reputational and financial  harm,  including  funding  or  liquidity  shortfalls,  and  adverse  business decisions and regulatory risk if models fail to properly anticipate and manage risks.\n\n## Failure  to  properly  m anage  data  m ay  adversely  affect  our  ability  to manage compliance risk and business needs, and result in errors in our operations,  reporting  and  decision-m aking,  and  non-com pliance  with LRRs.\n\nWe  rely  on  our  ability  to  manage  and  process  data  accurately ,  timely  and completely, including capturing, transporting, aggregating, using, transmitting data externally ,  and   retaining  and   p rotecting  d ata  ap p rop ria tely .

Such disasters and effects could adversely impact our facilities, employees and clients' ability to repay outstanding loans, disrupt the operations of us and our clients or third parties, cause supply chain or distribution network disruptions, damage collateral and/or result in market volatility, ra p id  d e p o sit o utflo w s o r d ra w d o w ns o f cre d it fa cilitie s, th e  d e te rio ra tio n o f the value of collateral or insurance shortfalls.\n\nThere is also increasing risk related to the transition to a low-carbon economy .

Due to divergent views of stakeholders,  we  are  at  increased  risk  that  any  action,  or  lack  thereof,  by  us concerning our response to climate change will be perceived negatively by some stakeholders,  which  could  adversely  impact  our  reputation  and  businesses.  Our ability to meet our climate-related goals and targets, including our goal to achieve certain  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions  targets  by  2030  and  net  zero  GHG emissions in our financing activities, operations and supply chain before 2050, is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, such as  technological  advances,  clearly  defined  roadmaps  for  industry  sectors,  public policies and better emissions data reporting, and ongoing engagement with clients, suppliers,  investors,  government  officials  and  other  stakeholders.  Due  to  the evolving nature of climate-related risks, which are expected to increase over time, it is difficult to predict, id entify , monitor and  effectively mitigate climate-related  risks and uncertainties.\n\nFurthermore,  there  are  and  will  continue  to  be  challenges  related  to  the availability , q ua lity a nd  d isclosure of climate-related  d ata, includ ing d ata ob tained from third parties, which may result in legal, compliance and/or reputational harm.\n\n## Our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified em ployees is critical to our success, business prospects and com petitive position.\n\nOur performance and competitive position is heavily dependent on the talents, development  and  efforts  of  highly  skilled  individuals.  Competition  for  qualified personnel is intense from within and outside the financial services industry . Our competitors  include  global  institutions  and  institutions  subject  to  different compensation and hiring regulations than those imposed on us. Also, our ability to attract,  develop  and  retain  employees  could  be  impacted  by  our  reputation, professional and development opportunities, changes in regulation or enforcement practices, changes in workforce concerns, expectations, practices and preferences (including remote work), and increasing labor shortages and competition for labor, which could increase labor costs.\n\nWe  must  provide  market-level  compensation  to  attract  and  retain  qualified personnel. As a large financial and banking institution, we are and may become subject to additional limitations on compensation practices by the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC and other global regulators, which may not affect our competitors. Also, because a substantial portion of compensation paid to many of our employees is equity-based awards based on the value of our common stock, declines in our profitability  or  outlook  could  adversely  affect  the  ability  to  attract  and  retain employees.  If  we  are  unable  to  continue  to  attract,  d evelop  and  retain  qualified individuals,  our  business  prospects  and  competitive  position  could  be  adversely affected.",

          "chunk_text": "## PayPal Holdings, Inc.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\n\n## Customer accounts\n\nWe  hold  all  customer  balances,  both  in  the  U.S.  and  internationally,  as  direct  claims  against  us  which  are  reflected  on  our consolidated  balance  sheets  as  a  liability  classified  as  amounts  due  to  customers.  Certain  jurisdictions  where  PayPal  operates require us to hold eligible liquid assets, as defined by applicable regulatory requirements and commercial law in these jurisdictions, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount of all customer balances. Therefore, we restrict the use of the assets underlying the customer balances to meet these regulatory requirements and separately classify the assets as customer accounts in our consolidated balance sheets. We classify the assets underlying the customer balances as current based on their purpose and availability to fulfill our direct obligation under amounts due to customers. Customer funds for which PayPal is an agent and custodian on behalf of our customers are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. These funds include U.S. dollar funds which are deposited at one or more third-party financial institutions insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ('FDIC') and are eligible for FDIC pass-through insurance (subject to applicable limits). We act as an agent in facilitating cryptocurrency transactions on behalf of our customers.  Cryptocurrencies  held  on  behalf  of  our  customers  are  not  PayPal's  assets  and  therefore  are  not  reflected  on  our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nIn June 2018, the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the 'CSSF') agreed that PayPal's management may designate up to 35% of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to be used for European and U.S.  credit  activities.  During  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  an  additional  $700  million  was  approved  to  fund  such  credit activities.  As  of  December  31,  2021,  the  cumulative  amount  approved  by  management  to  be  designated  for  credit  activities aggregated to $2.7 billion and represented approximately 27% of European customer balances that have been made available for our  corporate  use  at  that  date  as  determined  by  applying  financial  regulations  maintained  by  the  CSSF.  At  the  time  PayPal's management designates the European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to be used to extend credit, the balances are classified as cash and cash equivalents and no longer classified as customer accounts on our consolidated balance sheets.  The  remaining  assets  underlying  the  customer  balances  remain  separately  classified  as  customer  accounts  on  our consolidated balance sheets. We identify these customer accounts separately from corporate funds and maintain them in interest and non-interest  bearing  bank  deposits,  time  deposits,  and  available-for-sale  debt  securities.  Customer  balances  deposited  with  our partners on a short-term basis in advance of customer transactions and used to fulfill our direct obligation under amounts due to customers  are  classified  as  cash  and  cash  equivalents  within  our  customer  accounts  classification  on  our  consolidated  balance sheets. See 'Note 8-Funds Receivable and Customer Accounts and Investments' for additional information related to customer accounts.\n\nWe  present  changes  in  funds  receivable  and  customer  accounts  as  cash  flows  from  investing  activities  in  our  consolidated statements of cash flows based on the nature of the activity underlying our customer accounts.\n\n## Funds receivable and funds payable\n\nFunds receivable and funds payable arise due to the time required to initiate collection from and clear transactions through external payment networks. When customers fund their PayPal account using their bank account, credit card, debit card, or withdraw funds from their PayPal account to their bank account or through a debit card transaction, there is a clearing period before the cash is received or settled, usually one to three business days for U.S. transactions and generally up to five business days for international transactions. In addition, a portion of our customers' funds are settled directly to their bank account. These funds are also classified as funds receivable and funds payable and arise due to the time required to initiate collection from and clear transactions through external payment networks.\n\n## Property and equipment\n\nProperty and equipment consists primarily of computer equipment, software and website development costs, land and buildings, leasehold  improvements,  and  furniture  and  fixtures.  Property  and  equipment  are  stated  at  historical  cost  less  accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets; generally, one to four years for computer equipment and software, including capitalized software and website development costs, three years for furniture and fixtures, up to 30 years for buildings and building improvements, and the shorter of five years or the non-cancelable term of the lease for leasehold improvements.",

      "answer": "In 2022, PayPal acknowledged the risk of losses from its Seller Protection Programs and noted that historical loss rates ranged between 0.09% and 0.15% of TPV, with the potential for increased losses due to macroeconomic conditions such as the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. By 2023, PayPal provided more structured financial disclosures, showing that the allowance for transaction losses was $64 million (down from $66 million in 2022), indicating a slight decrease in expected losses. This shift reflects a more defined and quantified approach to managing seller protection risk in 2023 compared to the more qualitative risk assessment in 2022.",

        "In 2022, PayPal described the risk of losses from Seller Protection Programs in qualitative terms, citing historical loss rates between 0.09% and 0.15% of TPV and potential increases due to macroeconomic factors.",

          "chunk_text": "## Credit ratings\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2021,  we  continue  to  be  rated  investment  grade  by  Standard  and  Poor's  Financial  Services,  LLC,  Fitch Ratings,  Inc.,  and  Moody's  Investors  Services  Inc.  We  expect  that  these  credit  rating  agencies  will  continue  to  monitor  our performance,  including  our  capital  structure  and  results  of  operations.  Our  goal  is  to  be  rated  investment  grade,  but  as circumstances change, there are factors that could result in our credit ratings being downgraded or put on a watch list for possible downgrading. If that were to occur, it could increase our borrowing rates, including the interest rate on borrowings under our Credit Agreement.\n\n## CURRENT AND FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENTS\n\nOur  material  cash  requirements  include  funds  to  support  current  and  potential:  operating  activities,  credit  products,  customer protection programs, stock repurchases, strategic investments, acquisitions, other commitments, and capital expenditures and other future obligations.\n\n## Credit products\n\nGrowth in our portfolio of loan receivables increases our liquidity needs, and any inability to meet those liquidity needs could adversely  affect  our  business. We  continue  to  evaluate  partnerships  and  third  party  sources  of  funding  for  our  loans  receivable portfolio.\n\nIn June 2018, the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the 'CSSF') agreed that PayPal's management may designate up to 35% of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to be used for European and U.S. credit activities. During the first quarter of 2021, an additional $700 million was approved to fund such credit activities. As of December 31, 2021, the cumulative  amount  approved  by  management  to  be  designated  for  credit  activities  aggregated  to  $2.7 billion and represented approximately 27% of European customer balances that have been made available for our corporate use at that date as determined by applying financial regulations maintained by the CSSF. We may periodically seek to designate additional amounts of customer balances, if necessary, based on utilization of the approved funds and anticipated credit funding requirements. While our objective is to expand the availability of our credit products with capital from external sources, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving that goal. Under certain exceptional circumstances, corporate liquidity could be called upon to meet our obligations related to our European customer balances.\n\nIn April 2020, PayPal was approved to participate in the PPP administered by the SBA. The program was designed to provide a direct  incentive  for  small  businesses  to  keep  their  workers  on  payroll  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic and includes initial loan repayment  deferrals  and  debt  forgiveness  provisions  for  eligible  borrowers.  Loans  made  under  this  program  are  funded  by  an independent  chartered  financial  institution  that  we  partner  with,  and  the  related  receivables  are  not  purchased  by  PayPal.  We receive a fee for providing origination services and loan servicing for the loans and retain operational risk related to those activities.\n\n## Customer protection programs\n\nThe risk of losses from our buyer and seller protection programs are specific to individual customers, merchants, and transactions, and may also be impacted by regional variations in, and changes or modifications to, the programs, including as a result of changes in  regulatory  requirements.  For  the  periods  presented  in  these  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in  this  report,  our transaction loss rates have ranged between 0.09% and 0.15% of TPV. Historical loss rates may not be indicative of future results. The duration and severity of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and related global economic conditions remain unknown. The negative impacts on macroeconomic conditions could increase the risk of merchant bankruptcy, insolvency, business failure, or other business interruption, which may result in an adverse impact on our transaction losses, particularly for merchants that sell goods or services in advance of the date of their delivery or use.\n\n## Stock repurchases\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we repurchased approximately $3.4 billion of our common stock in the open market under our stock repurchase program authorized in July 2018.  As of December  31, 2021, a total of approximately $5.1 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our July 2018 stock repurchase program.

          "chunk_text": "## Credit ratings\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2021,  we  continue  to  be  rated  investment  grade  by  Standard  and  Poor's  Financial  Services,  LLC,  Fitch Ratings,  Inc.,  and  Moody's  Investors  Services  Inc.  We  expect  that  these  credit  rating  agencies  will  continue  to  monitor  our performance,  including  our  capital  structure  and  results  of  operations.  Our  goal  is  to  be  rated  investment  grade,  but  as circumstances change, there are factors that could result in our credit ratings being downgraded or put on a watch list for possible downgrading. If that were to occur, it could increase our borrowing rates, including the interest rate on borrowings under our Credit Agreement.\n\n## CURRENT AND FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENTS\n\nOur  material  cash  requirements  include  funds  to  support  current  and  potential:  operating  activities,  credit  products,  customer protection programs, stock repurchases, strategic investments, acquisitions, other commitments, and capital expenditures and other future obligations.\n\n## Credit products\n\nGrowth in our portfolio of loan receivables increases our liquidity needs, and any inability to meet those liquidity needs could adversely  affect  our  business. We  continue  to  evaluate  partnerships  and  third  party  sources  of  funding  for  our  loans  receivable portfolio.\n\nIn June 2018, the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the 'CSSF') agreed that PayPal's management may designate up to 35% of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to be used for European and U.S. credit activities. During the first quarter of 2021, an additional $700 million was approved to fund such credit activities. As of December 31, 2021, the cumulative  amount  approved  by  management  to  be  designated  for  credit  activities  aggregated  to  $2.7 billion and represented approximately 27% of European customer balances that have been made available for our corporate use at that date as determined by applying financial regulations maintained by the CSSF. We may periodically seek to designate additional amounts of customer balances, if necessary, based on utilization of the approved funds and anticipated credit funding requirements. While our objective is to expand the availability of our credit products with capital from external sources, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving that goal. Under certain exceptional circumstances, corporate liquidity could be called upon to meet our obligations related to our European customer balances.\n\nIn April 2020, PayPal was approved to participate in the PPP administered by the SBA. The program was designed to provide a direct  incentive  for  small  businesses  to  keep  their  workers  on  payroll  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic and includes initial loan repayment  deferrals  and  debt  forgiveness  provisions  for  eligible  borrowers.  Loans  made  under  this  program  are  funded  by  an independent  chartered  financial  institution  that  we  partner  with,  and  the  related  receivables  are  not  purchased  by  PayPal.  We receive a fee for providing origination services and loan servicing for the loans and retain operational risk related to those activities.\n\n## Customer protection programs\n\nThe risk of losses from our buyer and seller protection programs are specific to individual customers, merchants, and transactions, and may also be impacted by regional variations in, and changes or modifications to, the programs, including as a result of changes in  regulatory  requirements.  For  the  periods  presented  in  these  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in  this  report,  our transaction loss rates have ranged between 0.09% and 0.15% of TPV. Historical loss rates may not be indicative of future results. The duration and severity of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and related global economic conditions remain unknown. The negative impacts on macroeconomic conditions could increase the risk of merchant bankruptcy, insolvency, business failure, or other business interruption, which may result in an adverse impact on our transaction losses, particularly for merchants that sell goods or services in advance of the date of their delivery or use.\n\n## Stock repurchases\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we repurchased approximately $3.4 billion of our common stock in the open market under our stock repurchase program authorized in July 2018.  As of December  31, 2021, a total of approximately $5.1 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our July 2018 stock repurchase program.

      "answer": "In 2022, PayPal applied macroeconomic factors such as forecasted trends in unemployment and benchmark credit card charge-off rates to its revolving consumer credit loss curves, using a single scenario deemed most appropriate for the economic conditions. By 2023, the company updated its expected credit loss models for revolving consumer receivables to include forecasted trends in household disposable income and retail e-commerce sales, replacing unemployment rates after the first quarter of 2023. This reflects a shift in the macroeconomic indicators used to inform loss curves for this segment.",

          "chunk_text": "We also establish an allowance for loans and interest receivable, which represents our estimate of current expected credit losses inherent in our portfolio of loans and interest receivable. This evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments. The allowance is primarily based on expectations of credit losses based on historical lifetime loss data as well as macroeconomic forecasts applied to the portfolio, which is segmented by factors such as geographic region, delinquency, and vintage. Loss curves are generated using historical loss data for each loan portfolio and are applied to segments of each portfolio, categorized by factors such as geographic region, first borrowing versus repeat borrowing, delinquency, credit rating and vintage, which vary by portfolio. We then apply macroeconomic factors such as forecasted  trends  in  unemployment  and  benchmark  credit  card  charge-off  rates, which are sourced externally, using a single scenario that we believe is most appropriate to the economic conditions applicable to a particular period. We utilize externally sourced macroeconomic scenario data to supplement our historical information due to the limited period in which our credit product offerings have been in existence. Projected loss rates, inclusive of historical loss data and macroeconomic factors, are applied to the principal amount of our consumer and merchant receivables. We also include qualitative adjustments  that  incorporate  incremental  information  not  captured  in  the  quantitative  estimates  of  our  current  expected  credit losses. Our consumer receivables consist of revolving products, which do not have a contractual term, and installment products. The reasonable and supportable forecast period for revolving products, installment products, and merchant products that we have included in our projected loss rates, which approximates the estimated life of the loans, is approximately 2 years, approximately 7 months to 2.5 years, and approximately 2.5 to 3.5 years, respectively. In 2020, the reasonable and supportable forecast period for revolving consumer products was based only on externally sourced data due to the lack of availability of historical data, and in 2021, it was updated to reflect historical loss experience with the portfolio. The allowance for current expected credit losses on interest and fees receivable is determined primarily by applying loss curves to each portfolio by geography, delinquency, and period of origination, among other factors.\n\nDetermining appropriate current expected credit loss allowances for loans and interest receivable is an inherently uncertain process and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates. We regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and  events  occur  that  may  impact  the  settlement  or  recovery  of  losses.  The  allowances  are  maintained  at  a  level  we  deem appropriate  to  adequately  provide  for  current  expected  credit  losses  at  the  balance  sheet  date  after  incorporating  the  impact  of externally sourced macroeconomic forecasts. These forecasts project scenarios such as future unemployment and benchmark credit card  charge-off  rates. As  of  December  31,  2021,  we  utilized  externally  published  projections  of  the  U.S.  and  U.K.  forecasted unemployment  rates  over  the  reasonable  and  supportable  forecast  period.  As  of  December  31,  2020,  we  utilized  externally published  projections  of  the  U.S.  forecasted  credit  card  charge-off  rates  and  U.K  forecasted  unemployment  rates  over  the reasonable and supportable forecast period. The overall principal and interest coverage ratio as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was  approximately  9%  and  23%,  respectively. A  significant  change  in  the  forecasted  macroeconomic  factors  could  result  in  a material change in our allowances. Our allowance as of December 31, 2021 took into account continued volatility with respect to macroeconomic conditions and uncertainty around the financial health of our merchant borrowers, including uncertainty around the effectiveness  of  loan  modification  programs  made  available  to  merchants.  Our  allowance  as  of  December  31,  2020  took  into account for the proactive and reactive measures that we took to help reduce financial difficulties experienced by our customers, limitations  in  our  expected  credit  loss  models  that  arose  due  to  the  extreme  fluctuations  in  both  the  actual  and  forecasted macroeconomic conditions in the period, varying degrees of merchant performance in the current environment as well as expected future performance, and to account for payment holidays granted. We are unable to predict the ultimate impact of these actions which may result in adjustments to our allowance for loans and interest receivable in future periods. An increase of 1% in the principal and interest coverage ratio would increase our allowances by approximately $53 million based on the loans and interest receivable balance outstanding as of December 31, 2021.\n\n## ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES\n\nOur  annual  tax  rate  is  based  on  our  income,  statutory  tax  rates,  and  tax  planning  opportunities  available  to  us  in  the  various jurisdictions  in  which  we  operate. Tax  laws  are  complex  and  subject  to  different  interpretations  by  the  taxpayer  and  respective government taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including  evaluating  uncertainties.  We  review  our  tax  positions  quarterly  and  adjust  the  balances  as  new  information  becomes available.  Our  income  tax  rate  is  significantly  affected  by  the  tax  rates  that  apply  to  our  foreign  earnings.  In  addition  to  local country tax laws and regulations, our income tax rate depends on the extent that our foreign earnings are taxed by the U.S. through provisions such as the GILTI tax and base erosion anti-abuse tax or as a result of our indefinite reinvestment assertion. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment about, and intentions concerning, our future operations.",

      "question": "How did PayPal's utilization of European customer balances for credit activities evolve between 2022 and 2023, and what does this indicate about its strategic approach to funding credit products?",
      "answer": "In 2022, PayPal had approved $3.8 billion of European customer balances for credit activities, representing approximately 37% of European customer balances available for corporate use. In 2023, this approved amount decreased to $3.0 billion, representing 39% of European customer balances. This indicates a slight reduction in the total approved funding base but a higher percentage utilization of available balances, suggesting a more efficient use of existing customer balances for credit activities. Additionally, PayPal entered into a new \u20ac40 billion agreement in 2023 to sell consumer installment receivables, with $5.5 billion sold during the year, signaling a strategic shift toward external funding mechanisms to support credit product expansion.",

        "Step 3: Analyze the change: a decrease in total approved funds but an increase in percentage usage and the introduction of a major external funding arrangement."

          "chunk_text": "## Credit ratings\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2021,  we  continue  to  be  rated  investment  grade  by  Standard  and  Poor's  Financial  Services,  LLC,  Fitch Ratings,  Inc.,  and  Moody's  Investors  Services  Inc.  We  expect  that  these  credit  rating  agencies  will  continue  to  monitor  our performance,  including  our  capital  structure  and  results  of  operations.  Our  goal  is  to  be  rated  investment  grade,  but  as circumstances change, there are factors that could result in our credit ratings being downgraded or put on a watch list for possible downgrading. If that were to occur, it could increase our borrowing rates, including the interest rate on borrowings under our Credit Agreement.\n\n## CURRENT AND FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENTS\n\nOur  material  cash  requirements  include  funds  to  support  current  and  potential:  operating  activities,  credit  products,  customer protection programs, stock repurchases, strategic investments, acquisitions, other commitments, and capital expenditures and other future obligations.\n\n## Credit products\n\nGrowth in our portfolio of loan receivables increases our liquidity needs, and any inability to meet those liquidity needs could adversely  affect  our  business. We  continue  to  evaluate  partnerships  and  third  party  sources  of  funding  for  our  loans  receivable portfolio.\n\nIn June 2018, the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the 'CSSF') agreed that PayPal's management may designate up to 35% of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to be used for European and U.S. credit activities. During the first quarter of 2021, an additional $700 million was approved to fund such credit activities. As of December 31, 2021, the cumulative  amount  approved  by  management  to  be  designated  for  credit  activities  aggregated  to  $2.7 billion and represented approximately 27% of European customer balances that have been made available for our corporate use at that date as determined by applying financial regulations maintained by the CSSF. We may periodically seek to designate additional amounts of customer balances, if necessary, based on utilization of the approved funds and anticipated credit funding requirements. While our objective is to expand the availability of our credit products with capital from external sources, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving that goal. Under certain exceptional circumstances, corporate liquidity could be called upon to meet our obligations related to our European customer balances.\n\nIn April 2020, PayPal was approved to participate in the PPP administered by the SBA. The program was designed to provide a direct  incentive  for  small  businesses  to  keep  their  workers  on  payroll  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic and includes initial loan repayment  deferrals  and  debt  forgiveness  provisions  for  eligible  borrowers.  Loans  made  under  this  program  are  funded  by  an independent  chartered  financial  institution  that  we  partner  with,  and  the  related  receivables  are  not  purchased  by  PayPal.  We receive a fee for providing origination services and loan servicing for the loans and retain operational risk related to those activities.\n\n## Customer protection programs\n\nThe risk of losses from our buyer and seller protection programs are specific to individual customers, merchants, and transactions, and may also be impacted by regional variations in, and changes or modifications to, the programs, including as a result of changes in  regulatory  requirements.  For  the  periods  presented  in  these  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in  this  report,  our transaction loss rates have ranged between 0.09% and 0.15% of TPV. Historical loss rates may not be indicative of future results. The duration and severity of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and related global economic conditions remain unknown. The negative impacts on macroeconomic conditions could increase the risk of merchant bankruptcy, insolvency, business failure, or other business interruption, which may result in an adverse impact on our transaction losses, particularly for merchants that sell goods or services in advance of the date of their delivery or use.\n\n## Stock repurchases\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we repurchased approximately $3.4 billion of our common stock in the open market under our stock repurchase program authorized in July 2018.  As of December  31, 2021, a total of approximately $5.1 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our July 2018 stock repurchase program.

      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife maintained a short-term liquidity position of $12.4 billion and a total liquid asset base of $223.0 billion, reflecting a strong buffer to meet business requirements under both normal and stress scenarios. The company emphasized its belief in having ample liquidity and highlighted active monitoring and adjustment of liquidity and capital plans. By 2024, the narrative shifted to a more cautious tone, noting that maintaining or increasing cash buffers could limit capital available for innovation, acquisitions, and shareholder returns. This indicates that while liquidity remained a strategic priority, the implications of holding larger cash buffers became more pronounced, potentially constraining other capital deployment opportunities.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, MetLife reported a short-term liquidity position of $12.4 billion and liquid assets of $223.0 billion, emphasizing confidence in meeting liquidity needs under various scenarios.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the company acknowledged that maintaining or increasing cash buffers could negatively impact capital available for innovation, acquisitions, and shareholder returns.",
        "Step 3: The evolution shows a shift from a focus on adequacy of liquidity to a more nuanced view where cash buffer needs are seen as a potential constraint on broader capital management strategies."

We continuously monitor and adjust our liquidity  and  capital  plans  for  MetLife,  Inc.  and  its  subsidiaries  in  light  of  market  conditions,  as  well  as  changing  needs  and opportunities.\n\n## Short-term Liquidity\n\nWe maintain a substantial short-term liquidity position, which was $12.4 billion and $9.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Short-term liquidity includes cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed, including amounts received in connection with securities lending, repurchase agreements, derivatives, and secured borrowings, as well as amounts held in the closed block.\n\n## Liquid Assets\n\nAn integral part of our liquidity management includes managing our level of liquid assets, which was $223.0 billion and $235.1  billion  at  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  respectively.  Liquid  assets  include  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  short-term investments  and  publicly-traded  securities,  excluding  assets  that  are  pledged  or  otherwise  committed.  Assets  pledged  or otherwise  committed  include  amounts  received  in  connection  with  securities  lending,  repurchase  agreements,  derivatives, regulatory deposits, the collateral financing arrangement, funding agreements and secured borrowings, as well as amounts held in the closed block.\n\n## Capital Management\n\nWe have established several senior management committees as part of our capital management process. These committees, including the Capital Management Committee and the Enterprise Risk Committee ('ERC'), regularly review actual and projected capital levels (under a variety of scenarios including stress scenarios) and our annual capital plan in accordance with our capital policy. The Capital Management Committee is comprised of members of senior management, including MetLife, Inc.'s Chief Financial  Officer  ('CFO'),  Treasurer,  and  Chief  Risk  Officer  ('CRO').  The  ERC  is  also  comprised  of  members  of  senior management, including MetLife, Inc.'s CFO, CRO and Chief Investment Officer.\n\nOur Board of Directors and senior management are directly involved in the development and maintenance of our capital policy. The capital policy sets forth, among other things, minimum and target capital levels and the governance of the capital management process. All capital actions, including proposed changes to the annual capital plan, capital targets or capital policy, are reviewed by the Finance and Risk Committee of the Board of Directors prior to obtaining full Board of Directors approval. The Board of Directors approves the capital policy and the annual capital plan and authorizes capital actions, as required.\n\nSee 'Risk Factors - Capital Risks - We May Not be Able to Pay Dividends or Repurchase Our Stock Due to Legal and Regulatory  Restrictions  or  Cash  Buffer  Needs'  for  information  regarding  restrictions  on  payment  of  dividends  and  stock repurchases. See also Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding MetLife, Inc.'s common stock repurchase authorizations.",

Regulators or private parties may bring class actions, individual suits, or investigations seeking large recoveries and alleging wrongs relating to matters such as sales or underwriting practices, claims payments and procedures, failure to adequately or appropriately supervise, inappropriate compensation contrary to licensing requirements, product design, disclosure, administration,  investments,  denial  or  delay  of  benefits,  pandemic-  or  other  public  health-related  practices,  privacy  and  data  protection,  or  data  security  incidents, discriminatory or inequitable practices, and breaches of fiduciary or other duties. We may be unable to anticipate the outcome of a litigation or an investigation and the amount or range of loss, including with respect to our reputation, because we do not know how adversaries, fact finders, courts, regulators, or others will evaluate evidence, the law, or accounting principles, and whether they will do so differently than we have.\n\n## Our Efforts to Meet Environmental, Social, and Governance Standards and to Enhance the Sustainability of our Businesses May Not Meet Investors', Regulators' or Customers' Expectations\n\nSome of our shareholders, investors and customers, or those considering such a relationship with us, evaluate our business or other practices according to a variety of ESG standards and expectations. Our practices and performance are subject to increasing scrutiny with regard to various aspects of ESG  performance from regulators and other stakeholders.\n\nOur investors or others may evaluate our practices by ESG  criteria that are continually evolving and not always clear or readily measurable. These standards and expectations may also, as a whole, reflect contrasting or conflicting values or agendas and are not always susceptible to consensus. Our decisions and priorities must also necessarily, and simultaneously, take account of multiple business goals and interests. Our practices may not change in the particulars or at the rate some stakeholders expect. As  a  result,  our  efforts  to  conduct  our  business  in  accordance  with  some  or  all  these  ex pectations  may  involve  trade-offs.  In  June  2022,  we  announced  our commitment to achieve net zero greenhouse gas ('GHG ') emissions by 2050 or sooner. This commitment applies to GHG  emissions from our global owned and leased offices and vehicle fleets,  employee  business  travel,  supply  chain  and  general  account  investment  portfolio,  including  the  general  accounts  of  MetLife,  Inc.'s  wholly-owned subsidiaries, where reliable data and methodologies are available. We have oriented our climate objectives and interim targets to advance this commitment, which involves assumptions and expectations that involve risks and uncertainties.  Data and measurement techniques continue to evolve.  Further, because of the financed emissions included in our investment portfolio, our ability to meet our commitments is dependent on those counterparties meeting their own carbon reduction objectives. We may fail to meet our commitments or targets, and our policies and processes to evaluate and manage ESG  standards in coordination with other business priorities may not prove completely effective or fully satisfy ex pectations of some stakeholders. For example, some current customers and potential customers may decline to do business with us based on our sustainability  practices  and  related  policies  and  actions.  We  may  also  face  adverse  regulatory,  investor,  media,  or  public  scrutiny  leading  to  business, reputational, or legal challenges.\n\n## Capital Risks\n\n## We May Not be Able to Pay Dividends or Repurchase Our Stock Due to Legal and Regulatory Restrictions or Cash Buffer Needs\n\nOur financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, future prospects, capital position, liquidity, financial strength and credit ratings, as well as regulatory restrictions  on  the  payment  of  dividends  by  MetLife,  Inc.'s  insurance  subsidiaries,  general  market  conditions,  the  market  price  of  our  common  stock  compared  to management's assessment of the stock's underlying value, applicable regulatory approvals, other legal and accounting factors, and any other factors our Board deems relevant may preclude us from paying dividends or repurchasing our common stock.\n\nOther factors may affect our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our common stock. G overnments, investors or media may pressure us not to repurchase shares of our  common  stock  or  other  securities,  or  prohibit  us  from  doing  so.  Our  use  of  other  means  to  return  ex cess  capital  to  shareholders  may  be  less  tax -efficient  than repurchases. We maintain a buffer of cash and other liquid assets, and may increase it. As a result, we may have less capital to devote to other uses, such as innovation, acquisitions, development and return of capital to shareholders. We may also be restricted from repurchasing shares or entering into share repurchase programs at times, such as when we are aware of material non-public information.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the 2015 Director Stock Plan specified that each share issued under the plan reduced the number of shares remaining for issuance by one, and shares recovered from expired, forfeited, or cash-settled awards were again available for issuance. By 2024, the plan had a total of 35,395,894 shares authorized for issuance as of January 1, 2015, with 37,608,213 shares recovered for issuance between 2015 and 2024. However, 42,343,146 shares were covered by new awards and reinvested dividends since 2015, leaving 30,660,961 shares available for future issuance. This reflects a net reduction in available shares over time despite ongoing share recovery, indicating a shift in the balance between new issuances and recovered shares.",

        "Step 3: The comparison shows that while shares were recovered, the number of shares used for new awards and reinvested dividends exceeded the number recovered, leading to a net decrease in available shares, indicating a change in the plan's utilization and availability dynamics."

Each Share MetLife, Inc. issues in connection with a Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right granted under the 2005 Stock Plan, or in connection with any award under any other plan for employees and agents (including any Deferred Shares resulting from such awards), reduces the number of Shares remaining for issuance by 1.0. ('Standard Award Ratio'). Shares related to awards that are recovered, and therefore authorized for issuance under the 2015 Stock Plan, are recovered with consideration of the 2005 Stock Plan Share Award Ratio and Standard Award Ratio, as applicable. Each Share MetLife, Inc. issues under the 2005 Director Stock Plan or 2015 Director Stock Plan (including any Deferred Shares resulting from such awards) reduces  the  number  of  Shares  remaining  for  issuance  under  that  plan  by  one.  Shares  related  to  awards  that  are  recovered,  and therefore authorized for issuance under the 2015 Director Stock Plan are recovered with consideration of this ratio.

In addition, if MetLife, Inc. was to grant a Share-settled Stock Appreciation Right under the 2015 Director Stock Plan, only the number of Shares issued, net of the Shares  tendered,  if  any,  would  be  deemed  delivered  for  purposes  of  determining  the  maximum  number  of  Shares  available  for issuance under the 2015 Director Stock Plan.\n\nUnder both the 2015 Stock Plan and the 2015 Director Stock Plan, in the event of a corporate event or transaction (including, but  not  limited  to,  a  change  in  the  Shares  or  the  capitalization  of  MetLife)  such  as  a  merger,  consolidation,  reorganization, recapitalization,  separation,  stock  dividend,  extraordinary  dividend,  stock  split,  reverse  stock  split,  split  up,  spin-off,  or  other distribution of stock or property of MetLife, combination of securities, exchange of securities, dividend in kind, or other like change in capital structure or distribution (other than normal cash dividends) to shareholders of MetLife, or any similar corporate event or transaction,  the  appropriate  committee  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  MetLife,  in  order  to  prevent  dilution  or  enlargement  of participants' rights under the applicable plan, shall substitute or adjust, as applicable, the number and kind of Shares that may be issued under that plan and shall adjust the number and kind of Shares subject to outstanding awards. Any Shares related to awards under either plan which: (i) terminate by expiration, forfeiture, cancellation, or otherwise without the issuance of Shares; (ii) are settled in cash either in lieu of Shares or otherwise; or (iii) are exchanged with the appropriate committee's permission for awards not involving Shares, are available again for grant under the applicable plan.

They may also take actions that harm our customers and independent sales intermediaries or their operations, which may affect our business relationships with them and their ability to purchase or distribute our products.\n\nGovernments  may  change  regulation  of  financial  services,  insurance,  variable  annuities  and  variable  life  insurance,  securities,  derivatives,  pension,  health  care, accounting, cybersecurity, AI, privacy and data protection, tort reform, taxation, benefit plan investment advice and related fiduciary duties, antitrust as applied to the business of health insurance or otherwise, and other areas. Laws and regulations may also affect customers, sales intermediaries, or others. We or others may fail to comply with these requirements or suffer adverse regulatory examinations or audits. Regulators and courts may also interpret rules differently from the way we have, or change interpretations of laws or rules, and legislators may change statutes. Any of these changes may harm our ability to continue to offer the products we do today or to introduce new products.\n\nWe may incur costs to comply with laws and regulations and changes to these laws and regulations may increase our expenses and regulatory capital charges. Our failure to comply with our own policies or with regulatory requirements may harm our reputation or result in sanctions or legal claims.\n\nLaws, regulations or regulatory actions may limit or change the type, amount or structure of compensation or benefits we offer our employees or others, or may limit or ban the use of non-competition agreements, which may harm our ability to compete in recruiting and retaining key personnel. We may also fail to fulfill our fiduciary or other benefit-related obligations completely.\n\nCompliance with solvency standards or financial condition regulations may increase our capital and reserve requirements, risk management costs, and reporting costs. See 'Business - Regulation - State Insurance Regulation - Surplus and Capital' for a summary of the NAIC's developments related to financial condition regulation. We may be subject to enhanced capital standards, supervision and additional requirements, such as group capital standards or insurer capital standards. MetLife, Inc. could be compelled to undergo FDIC liquidation if it becomes insolvent or is in danger of defaulting on its obligations, potentially imposing greater losses on shareholders and unsecured creditors than under the Bankruptcy Code. This could also apply to financial institutions whose debt we hold and could harm the value of our holdings. We could be assessed charges in connection with a financial company liquidation.\n\nOur ability to react to rapidly changing economic conditions and the dynamic, competitive markets may be impaired if our product designs do not allow frequent and contemporaneous revisions of key pricing elements, or if we are unable to work collaboratively with regulators. Changes in regulatory approval processes, rules and other dynamics in the regulatory process could harm our ability to react to such changing conditions. Rules on defined benefit pension plan funding may reduce the likelihood or delay corporate plan sponsors in terminating their plans or engaging in transactions to partially or fully transfer pension obligations. This could affect the mix  of our pension risk transfers and increase non-guaranteed funding products.\n\nGovernmental bodies may delay acting on or implementing regulatory or policy changes due to circumstances outside of our control, including, but not limited to, public health issues. Such delays may increase uncertainty, prolong deleterious regulations and policies, delay or prevent beneficial regulatory or policy changes, and create the potential for later, more rapid changes to which we may find it more difficult to adjust.\n\nOur New Y ork insurance regulator's annual SCL for year-end asset adequacy testing may impose unforeseen assumptions or requirements that require us to increase or release reserves, which could affect our statutory capital and surplus.\n\n## Governments or Others May Increase our Taxes by Changing or Re-Interpreting Tax Laws, Making Some of Our Products Less Attractive to Consumers\n\nChanges in tax laws or interpretations of such laws could increase our corporate taxes, reduce our earnings, and adjust the value of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes may increase our effective tax rate or have implications that make our products less attractive to consumers. Tax authorities may enact laws, change regulations to increase existing tax es, or add new types of tax es, and authorities who have not imposed tax es in the past may impose tax es.",

      "question": "How did MetLife's valuation approach and sensitivity to fair value changes for FVO securities evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of the impact of U.S. dollar appreciation?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife reported that FVO securities had an estimated fair value of $1.6 billion and were sensitive to changes in the U.S. dollar, with a 10% appreciation leading to a $54 million decrease in value. By 2024, while no direct fair value figure for FVO securities is provided, the company emphasized a broader sensitivity framework where nonperformance risk spreads and unobservable inputs varied by duration and currency, indicating a more nuanced and dynamic valuation methodology. This evolution shows a shift from a static sensitivity model to a more complex, duration- and currency-dependent approach.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, FVO securities had a reported fair value of $1.6 billion, with a clearly defined sensitivity of -$54 million under a 10% U.S. dollar appreciation scenario.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the valuation methodology for FVO and similar Level 3 securities was described as using varying nonperformance risk spreads and unobservable inputs dependent on duration and currency, suggesting a more detailed and dynamic modeling approach.",
        "Step 3: The shift from a single sensitivity figure to a more complex, variable-driven model indicates a transformation in how MetLife assessed and reported the fair value risk of FVO securities, particularly in response to macroeconomic factors like currency fluctuations."

Fair Value (continued)\n\n- (7) Changes in estimated fair value are based on long U.S. dollar net asset positions and will be inversely impacted for short U.S. dollar net asset positions.\n- (8) Mortality  rates  vary  by  age  and  by  demographic  characteristics  such  as  gender.  Mortality  rate  assumptions  are  based  on  company  ex perience.  A  mortality improvement assumption is also applied. For any given contract, mortality rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for purposes of valuing the MRBs. For contracts that contain only a GMDB, any increase (decrease) in mortality rates result in an increase (decrease) in the estimated fair value of MRBs. Generally, for contracts that contain both a GMDB and a living benefit (e.g., GMIB, GMWB, GMAB), any increase (decrease) in mortality rates result in a decrease (increase) in the estimated fair value of MRBs.\n- (9) Base lapse rates are adjusted at the contract level based on a comparison of the actuarially calculated guaranteed values and the current policyholder account value, as well as other factors, such as the applicability of any surrender charges. A dynamic lapse function reduces the base lapse rate when the guaranteed amount is greater than the account value as in the money contracts are less likely to lapse. Lapse rates are also generally assumed to be lower in periods when a surrender charge applies. For any given contract, lapse rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for purposes of valuing the MRBs.\n- (10) The utilization rate assumption estimates the percentage of contractholders with GMIBs or a lifetime withdrawal benefit who will elect to utilize the benefit upon becoming eligible. The rates may vary by the type of guarantee, the amount by which the guaranteed amount is greater than the account value, the contract's withdrawal history and by the age of the policyholder. For any given contract, utilization rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for purposes of valuing the MRBs.\n- (11) The withdrawal rate represents the percentage of account balance that any given policyholder will elect to withdraw from the contract each year. The withdrawal rate assumption varies by age and duration of the contract, and also by other factors such as benefit type. For any given contract, withdrawal rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for purposes of valuing the MRBs. For GMWBs, any increase (decrease) in withdrawal rates results in an increase (decrease) in the estimated fair value of the guarantees. For GMABs and GMIBs, any increase (decrease) in withdrawal rates results in a decrease (increase) in the estimated fair value.\n- (12) Long-term equity volatilities represent equity volatility beyond the period for which observable equity volatilities are available. For any given contract, long-term equity volatility rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for purposes of valuing the MRBs.\n\n(13) Nonperformance risk spread varies by duration and by currency. For any given contract, multiple nonperformance risk spreads will apply, depending on the duration of the cash flow being discounted for purposes of valuing the MRBs.\n\nAll other classes of securities classified within  Level 3, including those within Unit-linked and FVO securities, Other investments, Separate account assets, and Embedded derivatives within funds withheld related to certain ceded reinsurance, use the same valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs as previously described for Level 3 securities. G enerally, all other classes of assets and liabilities classified within Level 3 that are not included above use the same valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs as previously described for Level 3. The sensitivity of the estimated fair value to changes in the significant unobservable inputs for these other assets and liabilities is similar in nature to that described in the preceding table. The valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement for the more significant assets measured at estimated fair value on a nonrecurring basis and determined using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) are summarized in '- Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements.'",

      "question": "How has MetLife's approach to managing cash buffer needs in relation to stock repurchases evolved from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of remaining repurchase authorization and liquidity considerations?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife had $1.5 billion remaining under its $3.0 billion common stock repurchase authorization as of December 31, 2021, indicating a significant but partially utilized capacity for returning capital to shareholders. By 2024, the company emphasized increased caution around cash buffer needs, noting that maintaining or increasing liquidity buffers could limit capital available for repurchases, acquisitions, and innovation. This reflects a shift from a more active repurchase posture in 2022 to a more conservative liquidity strategy in 2024, influenced by regulatory, market, and internal capital considerations.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, MetLife had $1.5 billion remaining under a $3.0 billion repurchase authorization, showing a clear intent to return capital to shareholders.",

        "Step 3: The evolution from a defined repurchase program with remaining capacity in 2022 to a more restricted liquidity strategy in 2024 indicates a transformation in how cash buffer needs impact stock repurchase decisions."

Regulators or private parties may bring class actions, individual suits, or investigations seeking large recoveries and alleging wrongs relating to matters such as sales or underwriting practices, claims payments and procedures, failure to adequately or appropriately supervise, inappropriate compensation contrary to licensing requirements, product design, disclosure, administration,  investments,  denial  or  delay  of  benefits,  pandemic-  or  other  public  health-related  practices,  privacy  and  data  protection,  or  data  security  incidents, discriminatory or inequitable practices, and breaches of fiduciary or other duties. We may be unable to anticipate the outcome of a litigation or an investigation and the amount or range of loss, including with respect to our reputation, because we do not know how adversaries, fact finders, courts, regulators, or others will evaluate evidence, the law, or accounting principles, and whether they will do so differently than we have.\n\n## Our Efforts to Meet Environmental, Social, and Governance Standards and to Enhance the Sustainability of our Businesses May Not Meet Investors', Regulators' or Customers' Expectations\n\nSome of our shareholders, investors and customers, or those considering such a relationship with us, evaluate our business or other practices according to a variety of ESG standards and expectations. Our practices and performance are subject to increasing scrutiny with regard to various aspects of ESG  performance from regulators and other stakeholders.\n\nOur investors or others may evaluate our practices by ESG  criteria that are continually evolving and not always clear or readily measurable. These standards and expectations may also, as a whole, reflect contrasting or conflicting values or agendas and are not always susceptible to consensus. Our decisions and priorities must also necessarily, and simultaneously, take account of multiple business goals and interests. Our practices may not change in the particulars or at the rate some stakeholders expect. As  a  result,  our  efforts  to  conduct  our  business  in  accordance  with  some  or  all  these  ex pectations  may  involve  trade-offs.  In  June  2022,  we  announced  our commitment to achieve net zero greenhouse gas ('GHG ') emissions by 2050 or sooner. This commitment applies to GHG  emissions from our global owned and leased offices and vehicle fleets,  employee  business  travel,  supply  chain  and  general  account  investment  portfolio,  including  the  general  accounts  of  MetLife,  Inc.'s  wholly-owned subsidiaries, where reliable data and methodologies are available. We have oriented our climate objectives and interim targets to advance this commitment, which involves assumptions and expectations that involve risks and uncertainties.  Data and measurement techniques continue to evolve.  Further, because of the financed emissions included in our investment portfolio, our ability to meet our commitments is dependent on those counterparties meeting their own carbon reduction objectives. We may fail to meet our commitments or targets, and our policies and processes to evaluate and manage ESG  standards in coordination with other business priorities may not prove completely effective or fully satisfy ex pectations of some stakeholders. For example, some current customers and potential customers may decline to do business with us based on our sustainability  practices  and  related  policies  and  actions.  We  may  also  face  adverse  regulatory,  investor,  media,  or  public  scrutiny  leading  to  business, reputational, or legal challenges.\n\n## Capital Risks\n\n## We May Not be Able to Pay Dividends or Repurchase Our Stock Due to Legal and Regulatory Restrictions or Cash Buffer Needs\n\nOur financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, future prospects, capital position, liquidity, financial strength and credit ratings, as well as regulatory restrictions  on  the  payment  of  dividends  by  MetLife,  Inc.'s  insurance  subsidiaries,  general  market  conditions,  the  market  price  of  our  common  stock  compared  to management's assessment of the stock's underlying value, applicable regulatory approvals, other legal and accounting factors, and any other factors our Board deems relevant may preclude us from paying dividends or repurchasing our common stock.\n\nOther factors may affect our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our common stock. G overnments, investors or media may pressure us not to repurchase shares of our  common  stock  or  other  securities,  or  prohibit  us  from  doing  so.  Our  use  of  other  means  to  return  ex cess  capital  to  shareholders  may  be  less  tax -efficient  than repurchases. We maintain a buffer of cash and other liquid assets, and may increase it. As a result, we may have less capital to devote to other uses, such as innovation, acquisitions, development and return of capital to shareholders. We may also be restricted from repurchasing shares or entering into share repurchase programs at times, such as when we are aware of material non-public information.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the fair value of Net derivative assets (liabilities) was $19 million as of December 31, 2021, with changes in value primarily tied to derivative activity such as issuances ($68 million), settlements ($-37 million), and transfers ($6 million). By 2024, the fair value had increased significantly to $58 million as of December 31, 2023. Additionally, the valuation methodology shifted from being primarily based on realized and unrealized gains/losses reported in net income to being assessed using discounted cash flows with a focus on observable inputs like swap rates (3-5%, weighted average of 4%). This indicates both a material increase in value and a methodological shift toward more transparent and observable valuation techniques.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Capital One reported that the assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs, including securitized debt obligations, were primarily composed of loan receivables and debt securities issued by the VIEs, with the liabilities reported under 'securitized debt obligations' on the consolidated balance sheets. By 2024, the carrying value of 'Securitized debt obligations' was $18,043 million, with a fair value of $18,067 million, all categorized under Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. This indicates that Capital One maintained a significant exposure to securitized debt obligations, with a slight increase in fair value relative to carrying value, suggesting stable valuation and continued involvement in securitization activities.",

        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 (2022) - Capital One's consolidated VIEs included securitized debt obligations, with assets primarily consisting of loan receivables and liabilities reported under 'securitized debt obligations'.",

        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - Capital One's exposure to securitized debt obligations remained significant, with a slight increase in fair value compared to carrying value, indicating stable valuation and ongoing involvement in securitization."

Our primary involvement with VIEs is related to our securitization transactions in which we transfer assets to securitization trusts. We primarily securitize credit card and auto loans, which have provided a source of funding for us and enabled us to transfer a certain portion of the economic risk of the loans or related debt securities to third parties.\n\nThe entity that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is referred to as the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE. The majority of the VIEs in which we are involved have been consolidated in our financial statements.\n\n## Summary of Consolidated and Unconsolidated VIEs\n\nThe assets of our consolidated VIEs primarily consist of cash, loan receivables and the related allowance for credit losses, which we report on our consolidated balance sheets under restricted cash for securitization investors, loans held in consolidated trusts and allowance for credit losses, respectively. The assets of a particular VIE are the primary source of funds to settle its obligations. Creditors of these VIEs typically do not have recourse to our general credit. Liabilities primarily consist of debt securities issued by the VIEs, which we report under securitized debt obligations on our consolidated balance sheets. For unconsolidated VIEs, we present the carrying amount of assets and liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets and our maximum exposure to loss. Our maximum exposure to loss is estimated based on the unlikely event that all of the assets in the VIEs become worthless and we are required to meet the maximum amount of any remaining funding obligations.\n\nThe  tables  below  present  a  summary  of  VIEs  in  which  we  had  continuing  involvement  or  held  a  significant  variable  interest, aggregated based on VIEs with similar characteristics as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. We separately present information for consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs.\n\n## Table 5.1: Carrying Amount of Consolidated and Unconsolidated VIEs\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, Capital One identified securitized debt obligations as part of its diversified funding mix, which also included deposits, senior and subordinated notes, federal funds purchased, and FHLB advances. While no specific dollar value was disclosed in 2022, the company emphasized the strategic importance of securitized debt obligations in maintaining access to wholesale funding. By 2024, Capital One disclosed that its securitized debt obligations had a carrying value of $14,264 million and an estimated fair value of $14,335 million. This represents a concrete quantification of the instrument's role in the company's capital structure, showing an increased transparency and continued use of this funding source.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, Capital One described securitized debt obligations as a key component of its diversified wholesale funding strategy, though no specific dollar value was provided.",

        "Step 3: The evolution from a qualitative description in 2022 to a quantified disclosure in 2024 indicates a continued reliance on securitized debt obligations as a funding source, with enhanced transparency in the latter year."

We  provide  additional  information  on  the  composition  of  deposits  in  'MD&amp;AConsolidated Balance Sheets Analysis-Funding Sources Composition' and in 'Note 8-Deposits and Borrowings.'\n\n## Funding\n\nOur primary source of funding comes from deposits, as they are a stable and relatively low cost source of funding. In addition to deposits, we raise funding through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes and securitized debt obligations, federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase and FHLB advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios. A key objective in our use of these markets is to maintain access to a diversified mix of wholesale funding sources. See 'MD&amp;A-Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis-Funding Sources Composition' for additional information on our primary sources of funding.\n\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments that affect our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Our future cash outflows primarily relate to deposits, borrowings and operating leases. The actual timing and amounts of future cash payments may vary over time due to a number of factors, such as discretionary debt repurchases.\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)",

      "answer": "In 2022, the company reported restricted cash for securitization investors as part of consolidated VIEs, with the assets and liabilities presented on the consolidated balance sheets. By 2024, the restricted cash for securitization investors was valued at $441 million, with the entire amount classified under Level 1 of the estimated fair value hierarchy, indicating a shift toward more transparent or market-based valuation methods. This reflects a more defined and standardized valuation approach in 2024 compared to 2022, where the fair value hierarchy was not explicitly detailed for this category.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, the company described restricted cash for securitization investors as part of the consolidated VIEs, but no specific fair value hierarchy was provided for this line item.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the company disclosed a carrying and estimated fair value of $441 million for restricted cash for securitization investors, with the full amount classified under Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.",
        "Step 3: The change indicates a shift in how the company values and reports this asset, moving toward a more transparent and market-supported valuation framework by 2024."

Our primary involvement with VIEs is related to our securitization transactions in which we transfer assets to securitization trusts. We primarily securitize credit card and auto loans, which have provided a source of funding for us and enabled us to transfer a certain portion of the economic risk of the loans or related debt securities to third parties.\n\nThe entity that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is referred to as the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE. The majority of the VIEs in which we are involved have been consolidated in our financial statements.\n\n## Summary of Consolidated and Unconsolidated VIEs\n\nThe assets of our consolidated VIEs primarily consist of cash, loan receivables and the related allowance for credit losses, which we report on our consolidated balance sheets under restricted cash for securitization investors, loans held in consolidated trusts and allowance for credit losses, respectively. The assets of a particular VIE are the primary source of funds to settle its obligations. Creditors of these VIEs typically do not have recourse to our general credit. Liabilities primarily consist of debt securities issued by the VIEs, which we report under securitized debt obligations on our consolidated balance sheets. For unconsolidated VIEs, we present the carrying amount of assets and liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets and our maximum exposure to loss. Our maximum exposure to loss is estimated based on the unlikely event that all of the assets in the VIEs become worthless and we are required to meet the maximum amount of any remaining funding obligations.\n\nThe  tables  below  present  a  summary  of  VIEs  in  which  we  had  continuing  involvement  or  held  a  significant  variable  interest, aggregated based on VIEs with similar characteristics as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. We separately present information for consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs.\n\n## Table 5.1: Carrying Amount of Consolidated and Unconsolidated VIEs\n\n",

      "question": "How has AIG's financial relationship with Corebridge evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of equity ownership and income recognition?",
      "answer": "In 2023, AIG held 52.2% of Corebridge common stock and was in the process of selling down its stake, with the intention to fully divest over time. By 2024, AIG had transitioned to accounting for its remaining interest in Corebridge using the equity method, recognizing pre-tax income based on dividends received and changes in Corebridge's stock price from June 9, 2024. This represents a shift from direct ownership control to a more passive investment approach, indicating a significant change in the nature of AIG's financial relationship with Corebridge.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, AIG held a controlling 52.2% stake in Corebridge and was in the process of divesting it.",
        "Step 2: By 2024, AIG had moved to equity method accounting, indicating a significant reduction in ownership and a shift in how it recognizes income from Corebridge.",
        "Step 3: The change from majority ownership to equity method accounting shows a transformation in AIG's financial relationship with Corebridge, moving from operational control to passive investment."

This deconsolidation had significant tax implications, including restrictions on future consolidated tax filings for five years and the retention of Corebridge's net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards by Corebridge entities. By 2024, AIG no longer consolidated Corebridge's financials, and instead, AIG reported its investment in Corebridge under the equity method, recognizing $X in equity method income for the period from June 10, 2024, to December 31, 2024, based on dividends received and changes in Corebridge's stock price.

      "answer": "In 2023, AIG had a stake in Corebridge that included a potential equity dilution mechanism tied to Blackstone's right to exchange its ownership interest in Corebridge for AIG common shares, which would have introduced up to 24.1 million additional shares in 2022 (and 4.4 million in 2023) had the IPO not occurred before 2024. However, since the IPO occurred on September 19, 2022, this exchange right was terminated. By 2024, AIG's relationship with Corebridge had shifted from a stakeholding to an equity method investment, where AIG reported income based on dividends received and changes in Corebridge's stock price from June 9, 2024 onwards. This reflects a transformation from a potential equity dilution scenario to a post-divestiture equity income model.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, AIG had a stake in Corebridge that included a dilutive exchange option held by Blackstone, which could have introduced up to 24.1 million shares in 2022 (and 4.4 million in 2023) if Corebridge's IPO had not occurred before 2024.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, AIG no longer held Corebridge as a stake but instead accounted for it under the equity method, recognizing income based on dividends and stock price changes from June 9, 2024 onwards.",

By 2024, AIG no longer consolidated Corebridge as a subsidiary; instead, it reported Corebridge under the equity method as part of discontinued operations. During the second half of 2024, AIG reported equity method income from Corebridge, which included dividends received and changes in its stock price since June 9, 2024.

      "answer": "In 2023, PayPal disclosed that the costs associated with its protection programs were recorded in 'transaction and credit losses' during the period the payment transaction was completed, and it did not provide a separate service to customers under these programs. By 2024, PayPal introduced more detailed disclosures around its protection programs, highlighting that it incurs substantial losses from these programs due to customer disputes and faces challenges in recovering losses from merchants, especially in cases involving fraud or merchant insolvency. Additionally, PayPal noted that it may face increased exposure due to evolving fraud schemes and potential regulatory changes affecting chargeback requirements. This indicates a shift toward more explicit risk acknowledgment and a broader understanding of potential financial impact.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, PayPal disclosed that protection program costs were recognized in transaction and credit losses, with no separate service offering.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, PayPal introduced new details about losses from customer disputes, recovery limitations from merchants, and exposure from evolving fraud and regulatory changes.",
        "Step 3: The evolution reflects a transformation in PayPal's disclosure approach, moving from a general cost recognition framework to a more detailed risk-centric narrative involving external threats and regulatory exposure."

Measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud and abusive behavior are complex, require continuous improvement, and may not be effective in detecting and preventing fraud, particularly new and continually evolving forms of fraud or in connection with new or expanded product offerings. If these measures are not effective, our business could be negatively impacted. We also incur substantial losses from erroneous transactions and situations where linked accounts designated by customers to fund PayPal transactions have insufficient funds or are otherwise unavailable to fund the payments, or the payment is initiated to an unintended recipient in error. Numerous and evolving fraud schemes and misuse of our payments services could subject us to significant costs and liabilities, require us to change our business practices, cause us to incur significant remediation costs, lead to loss of customer confidence in, or decreased use of, our products and services,  damage our reputation and brands, divert the attention of management from the operation of our business, and result in significant compensation or contractual penalties from us to our customers and their business partners as a result of losses or claims. While we actively seek to recover transaction losses where possible, such recoveries may be insufficient to compensate us for such losses.\n\nOur purchase and seller protection programs ('protection programs') are intended to reduce the likelihood of losses for consumers and merchants from unauthorized and  fraudulent  transactions.  Our  purchase  protection  program  also  protects  consumers  who  do  not  receive  the  item  ordered  or  who  receive  an  item  that  is significantly different from its description. We incur substantial losses from our protection programs as a result of disputes filed by our customers. While we may seek to recover losses from our protection programs from the merchant, we ultimately may not be able to fully recover such losses (for example, if the merchant is unwilling or unable to pay, the transaction involves a fraudulent merchant, or the merchant provides sufficient evidence that the item was delivered).\n\nIn addition, consumers who pay through PayPal or V enmo may have reimbursement rights from their payment card issuer, which in turn will seek recovery from us. If losses incurred by us related to payment card transactions become excessive, we could lose the ability to accept payment cards for payment, which would negatively impact our business. Regulators and card networks may also adapt error resolution and chargeback requirements to account for evolving forms of fraud, which could increase PayPal's exposure to fraud losses and impact the scope of coverage of our protection programs. Increases in our loss rate, including as a result of changes to the scope of transactions covered by our protection programs, could negatively impact our business and results of operations. See 'Note 13-Commitments and ContingenciesProtection Programs ' to our consolidated financial statements.\n\nFailure  to  effectively  monitor  and  evaluate  the  financial  condition  of  our  merchants  may  ex pose  PayPal  to  losses.  In  the  event  of  the  bankruptcy,  insolvency, business failure, or other business interruption of a merchant that sells goods or services in advance of the date of their delivery or use (e.g., airline, cruise, or concert tickets, custom-made goods, and subscriptions), we could be liable to the buyers of such goods or services, including through our purchase protection program or through chargebacks on payment cards used by customers to fund their purchase. Allowances for transaction losses that we have established may be insufficient to cover incurred losses.\n\n## Use of our payments services for illegal activities or improper purposes could harm our business.\n\nWe expect that users will continue to attempt to use our payments platform for illegal activities or improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, sanctions evasion, illegal online gambling, fraudulent sales of goods or services, illegal telemarketing activities, illegal sales of prescription medications or controlled substances, piracy of software, movies, music, and other copyrighted, trademarked or digital goods, bank fraud, child pornography, human trafficking, prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products, securities fraud, pyramid or Ponzi schemes, or the facilitation of other illegal or improper activity. Moreover, certain activity  that  may  be  legal  in  one  jurisdiction  may  be  illegal  in  another  jurisdiction,  and  a  merchant  may  be  found  responsible  for  intentionally  or  inadvertently importing or exporting illegal goods, resulting in liability for us. Owners of intellectual property rights or government authorities may seek to bring legal action against providers of payments solutions, including PayPal, that are peripherally involved in the sale of infringing or allegedly infringing items by a user. While we invest in measures intended to prevent and detect illegal activities that may occur on our payments platform, these measures may not be effective in detecting and preventing illegal  activity  or  improper  uses,  and  we  may  be  subject  to  claims,  individual  and  class  action  lawsuits,  and  government  and  regulatory  requests,  inquiries,  or investigations that could result in liability, restrict our operations, impose additional restrictions or limitations on our business or require us to change our business practices, harm our reputation, increase our costs, and negatively impact our business.\n\n## Acquisitions, dispositions, strategic investments, and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties and could harm our business.\n\nWe expect to continue to consider and evaluate a wide array of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall business",

      "answer": "In 2023, PayPal had approved $3.0 billion of European customer balances for credit activities, representing approximately 39% of balances made available for corporate use. By 2024, the approved amount had decreased to $2.0 billion, or 26% of European customer balances. This indicates a strategic shift toward reducing reliance on customer balances for credit funding, potentially in favor of external financing sources, as evidenced by PayPal's multi-year agreement to sell consumer installment receivables, which saw $20.8 billion in loans sold in 2024 compared to $5.5 billion in 2023.",

        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The decrease in approved internal funds and the simultaneous increase in external loan sales ($5.5B in 2023 to $20.8B in 2024) suggests a strategic pivot toward external funding for credit products."

We expect that these credit rating agencies will continue to monitor our performance, including our capital structure and results of operations. Our goal is to be rated investment grade, but as circumstances change, there are factors that could result in our credit ratings being downgraded or put on a watch list for possible downgrading. If that were to occur, it could increase our borrowing rates, including the interest rate on borrowings under our credit agreements.\n\n## CURRENT AND FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENTS\n\nOur material cash requirements include funds to support current and potential: operating activities, credit products, customer protection programs, stock repurchases, strategic investments, acquisitions, other commitments, capital expenditures, and other future obligations.\n\n## Credit products\n\nGrowth in our portfolio of loans receivable increases our liquidity needs, and any inability to meet those liquidity needs could adversely affect our business. We continue to evaluate partnerships and third-party sources of funding for our credit products.\n\nThe  Luxembourg  Commission de  Surveillance du  Secteur  Financier (the 'CSSF') has agreed that  PayPal's management may designate up to 50% of  European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to fund European, U.K., and U.S. credit activities. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the cumulative amount approved by PayPal to be designated to fund credit activities was $2.0 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, and represented approximately 26% and 39% of European customer balances made available for our corporate use as of those respective dates, as determined by applying financial regulations maintained by the CSSF. We may periodically seek to change the designation of amounts of European customer balances for our credit activities, as we deem necessary, based on utilization of the approved funds and anticipated credit funding requirements. Under certain exceptional circumstances, corporate liquidity could be called upon to meet our obligations related to our European customer balances.\n\nIn June 2023, we entered into a multi-year agreement with a global investment firm to sell our eligible consumer installment receivables portfolio. In December 2024, this agreement was amended and restated to extend the commitment period to December 2026 and to increase the maximum balance of loans that can be sold at a time. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we sold $20.8 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively, of loans and interest receivable in connection with this agreement. For additional information, see 'Note 1-Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies' to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\n\nWhile our objective is to expand the availability of our credit products with capital from external sources, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving that goal.\n\n## Customer protection programs\n\nThe risk of losses from our customer protection programs are specific to individual consumers, merchants, and transactions, and may also be impacted by regional variations  in,  and  changes  or  modifications  to,  the  programs,  including  as  a  result  of  changes  in  regulatory  requirements.  For  the  periods  presented  in  these consolidated  financial  statements  included  in  this  report,  our  transaction  loss  rate  ranged  between  0.07%  and  0.09%  of  TPV .  Historical  loss  rates  may  not  be indicative of future results.\n\n## Stock repurchases\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased approximately $6.0 billion of our common stock in the open market under our stock repurchase program authorized in June 2022. As of December 31, 2024, a total of approximately $4.9 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our June 2022 stock repurchase program. For additional information, see 'Note 14-Stock Repurchase Programs' to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\n\n46",

      "question": "How has PayPal's treatment of the Global Restricted Stock Unit Award Grant Notice evolved between the 2023 and 2024 filings, particularly in terms of its documentation status and associated agreements?",
      "answer": "In the 2023 filing, the Global Restricted Stock Unit Award Grant Notice was listed as Exhibit 10.07+ and was associated with the PayPal Holdings, Inc. 2015 Equity Incentive Award Plan, with its form incorporated by reference from 10-12B/A filed on May 14, 2015. By 2024, the same form of the Global Restricted Stock Unit Award Grant Notice (Exhibit 10.07+) remained in place, still referencing the 2015 plan and incorporated by reference from the same 10-12B/A filing on May 14, 2015. However, in the 2024 filing, there was an updated form of the Global Performance Based Restricted Stock Unit Award Grant Notice (Exhibit 10.08+), which was now filed under the amended and restated plan and was linked to a more recent 10-Q filing on April 30, 2024. This indicates that while the base RSU grant notice remained unchanged, the performance-based variant saw active revision and documentation updates in 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, the Global Restricted Stock Unit Award Grant Notice was documented under Exhibit 10.07+ and tied to the 2015 Equity Incentive Award Plan, incorporated by reference from 10-12B/A filed May 14, 2015.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the same Global Restricted Stock Unit Award Grant Notice (Exhibit 10.07+) remained unchanged in documentation and reference, but the related performance-based variant (Exhibit 10.08+) was updated under the amended plan and linked to a 10-Q filing dated April 30, 2024.",
        "Step 3: The base form remained stable, but the performance-based version saw active revision, indicating an evolution in PayPal's equity compensation documentation strategy."

      "answer": "In 2023, PayPal disclosed that it estimated and recorded costs associated with protection programs in transaction and credit losses, but did not specify the exact amounts for the allowance for transaction losses or negative customer balances. In 2024, PayPal provided more detailed disclosures, including specific figures: the allowance for transaction losses increased from $64 million in 2023 to $86 million in 2024, and the allowance for negative customer balances rose from $218 million to $256 million. This indicates a significant increase in PayPal's financial commitments and potential risk exposure under its protection programs in 2024 compared to the prior year.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, PayPal disclosed the existence of protection programs and stated that associated costs were recorded in transaction and credit losses, but did not provide specific reserve figures.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, PayPal introduced more detailed disclosures, including specific dollar amounts for the allowance for transaction losses ($86 million in 2024 vs. $64 million in 2023) and negative customer balances ($256 million in 2024 vs. $218 million in 2023).",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a transformation in the level of financial commitment and transparency regarding protection programs, with both categories showing significant increases, suggesting higher expected losses or expanded program scope."

The estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments we may be required to make is equal to the current outstanding balances of the loans sold; however, the maximum potential amount of the indemnification is not, in our view, representative of the expected future exposure. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the current outstanding balances of the loans sold was $2.9 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. The terms of the indemnification align to the maturities of the loans sold.\n\nTo date, no significant costs have been incurred, either individually or collectively, in connection with our indemnification provisions.\n\n## OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\n\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital ex penditures, or capital resources.\n\n## PROTECTION PROGRAMS\n\nIn addition to the protections afforded by applicable law, we provide consumers and merchants with protection programs for certain purchase transactions completed on our payments platform. Our protection programs help protect both consumers and merchants from financial loss resulting from, among other things, counterparty non-performance. These programs are designed to promote confidence on the part of both consumers, who will be reimbursed in certain circumstances, such as not receiving  their  purchased  item  in  the  condition  significantly  as  described,  as  well  as  merchants,  who  will  receive  payment  in  certain  circumstances,  such  as establishing  proof  of  shipment  or  delivery  of  an  item  to  the  customer.  These  protection  programs  are  considered  assurance-type  warranties  under  applicable accounting standards for which we estimate and record associated costs in transaction and credit losses during the period the payment transaction is completed.\n\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, the allowance for transaction losses was $86 million and $64 million, respectively. The allowance for negative customer balances was $256 million and $218 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The following table shows changes in the allowance for transaction losses and negative customer balances related to our protection programs for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n\n",

      "question": "How has PayPal's description of its transaction management databases' capabilities evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in relation to global payment processing in different currencies?",
      "answer": "In 2023, PayPal described its transaction management databases as part of a platform that allowed consumers to withdraw funds in 56 currencies. By 2024, the company updated this figure to 57 currencies, indicating a slight expansion in the global reach of its transaction processing capabilities. Additionally, while both years emphasize the role of these databases in enabling customers to utilize PayPal's suite of products, the 2024 filing introduced a more consumer-centric framing, placing 'consumers' ahead of 'merchants' in describing the ecosystem served by the platform. These changes suggest a refinement in how PayPal positions its transaction management systems within its broader global payments infrastructure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, PayPal's transaction management databases supported withdrawals in 56 currencies.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, PayPal updated this figure to 57 currencies, showing a minor expansion in global payment processing capabilities.",
        "Step 3: The change in narrative framing and the increase in currency support indicate a subtle evolution in how PayPal describes the capabilities of its transaction management databases."

          "chunk_text": "The price structure for Mastercard's products and services is dependent on the nature of volumes, types of transactions and type of products and services offered to customers. Net revenue can be impacted by the following:\n\n- domestic or cross-border transactions\n- geographic region or country in which the transaction occurs\n- volumes/transactions subject to tiered rates\n- switched or not switched by the Company\n- amount of usage of the Company's other products or services\n- amount of rebates and incentives provided to customers\n\nThe Company classifies its net revenue into the following five categories:\n\nDomestic assessments are fees charged to issuers and acquirers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on cards and other devices that carry the Company's brands where the merchant country and the country of issuance are the same. Revenue from domestic assessments is recorded as revenue in the period it is earned, which is when the related volume is generated on the cards or other devices that carry the Company's brands.\n\nCross-border volume fees are charged to issuers and acquirers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on cards and other devices  that  carry  the  Company's  brands  where  the  merchant  country  and  the  country  of  issuance  are  different.  Revenue  from cross-border volume is recorded as revenue in the period it is earned, which is when the related volume is generated on the cards or other devices that carry the Company's brands.\n\nTransaction processing revenue is recognized for both domestic and cross-border transactions in the period in which the related transactions occur. Transaction processing includes the following:\n\n- Switched transaction revenue is generated from the following products and services:\n- Authorization, which is the process by which a transaction is routed to the issuer for approval. In certain circumstances, such as when the issuer's systems are unavailable or cannot be contacted, Mastercard or others approve such transactions on behalf of the issuer in accordance with either the issuer's instructions or applicable rules (also known as 'stand-in').\n- Clearing, which is the determination and exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a transaction has been successfully conducted at the point of interaction. Transactions are cleared among customers through Mastercard's central and regional processing systems.\n- Settlement, which facilitates the exchange of funds between parties.\n- Connectivity  fees are  charged  to  issuers,  acquirers  and  other  financial  institutions  for  network  access,  equipment  and  the transmission of authorization and settlement messages. These fees are based on the size of the data being transmitted and the number of connections to the Company's network.\n- Other processing fees include issuer and acquirer processing solutions, payment gateways for e-commerce merchants, mobile gateways for mobile-initiated transactions, and safety and security.\n\nOther revenues consist of value-added products and services that are often sold with the Company's payment service offerings and are recognized in the period in which the related services are performed or transactions occur. Other revenues include the following:\n\n- Cyber and intelligence solutions fees are for products and services offered to prevent, detect and respond to fraud and to ensure the safety of transactions made primarily on Mastercard products.\n- Data analytics and consulting fees are for insights, analytics, and test and learn capabilities as well as Mastercard's advisory and managed services.\n- Loyalty and rewards solutions fees are charged to issuers for benefits provided directly to consumers with Mastercard-branded cards, such as access to a global airline lounge network, global and local concierge services, individual insurance coverages, emergency card replacement, emergency cash advance services and a 24-hour cardholder service center. Loyalty and reward solution fees also include rewards campaigns and management services.\n- Program management services provided to prepaid card issuers consist of foreign exchange margin, commissions, load fees and ATM withdrawal fees paid by cardholders on the sale and encashment of prepaid cards.\n- Batch and real-time account-based payment services relating to ACH transactions and other ACH related services.\n- Other  payment-related  products  and  services  and  platforms,  including  account  and  transaction  enhancement  services,  open banking and digital identity solutions, rules compliance and publications.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MA introduced its digital identity solutions as part of an open banking platform that enabled data providers and third parties to access consumer data on a permissioned basis, aiming to improve customer experience and financial inclusion. The platform leveraged data principles such as consumer protection and consent management, and it focused on identity verification across people, devices, and transactions. In 2023, MA expanded its open banking capabilities, achieving connectivity to over 95% of deposit accounts in the U.S. and approximately 3,000 banks across Europe, which significantly enhanced the reach and application of its digital identity solutions. Additionally, in 2023, MA partnered with leading financial institutions to launch an ACH payment solution using its open banking infrastructure, indicating a deeper integration of digital identity within broader financial services.",

Our platform enables consumers to have choice of financial services, providing them the ability to access, control and benefit from the use of their data, as well as an improved payment experience. Our platform is also used to serve the needs of the lending market, including through streamlining loan application processes and improving credit decisioning, thereby driving further financial inclusion. The network connections that underpin this platform leverage our data principles (including data usage  guardrails, consumer  protection  and  consent management), as well as API technology.\n\nWe  enable  digital  identity  solutions,  which  provide  smooth  digital  experiences and  strengthen  and  secure  digital  payments  across  individuals,  devices  and accounts. Our digital identity capabilities focus on the identity of people, devices and  transactions.  They  embody  privacy  by  design  principles  and  are  consentcentric.  Our  solutions  include  device  intelligence  and  behavioral  biometrics  (to determine  whether  the  user  is  genuine  or  a  fraudulent  device),  document proofing, IP intelligence, biometrics, transaction fraud data (from which we derive insights  that  can  be  used  to  significantly  improve  the  global  approval  rate  of transactions), location, identity attributes and payment authorization.\n\n\u2022\n\n## Key 2021 Developments\n\nWe acquired Ekata, Inc., a leader in digital identity verification solutions, broadening our fraud prevention and digital identity verification programs by adding Ekata's identity verification data, machine learning technology and global experience.\n\n## Our People\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 24,000 persons globally. Our employee base is predominantly full-time and approximately  65%  were  employed  outside  of  the  United  States  in  more  than  80  countries  around  the  world.  We  also  had approximately 3,900 contractors which we used to supplement our employee base in order to meet specific needs. Our voluntary workforce turnover (rolling 12-month attrition) was 11% as of December 31, 2021. The total cost of our workforce for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $4.5 billion, which primarily consists of compensation, benefits and other personnel- and contractor-related costs.\n\nWe provide more detailed information regarding our employees, including additional workforce demographics such as gender and racial/ethnic  representation,  in  our  Sustainability  Report,  our  Proxy  Statement,  our  Global  Inclusion  Report  and  our  U.S. Consolidated EEO-1 Report, all of which are located on our website.\n\nWe  continue  to  support  our  employees  during  the  ongoing  global  COVID-19  pandemic.  We  have  extended  a  variety  of  global COVID-related employee benefits through 2022, including flexible hybrid working arrangements and additional paid time off due to illness, to get vaccinated, or to tend to childcare or eldercare-related demands. Our focus remains on the safety and well-being of our employees while maintaining health and safety protocols at each office location.\n\nManagement  reviews  our  people  strategy  and  culture,  as  well  as  related  risks,  with  our  Human  Resources  and  Compensation Committee  on  a  quarterly  basis,  and  annually  with  our  Board  of  Directors.  Additionally,  our  Board  of  Directors  and  our  Board committees are tasked with overseeing other human capital management matters on a regular basis, such as ensuring processes are in place for maintaining an ethical corporate culture, overseeing key diversity initiatives, policies and practices, and monitoring governance trends in areas such as human rights. Our ability to attract, retain and engage top talent and build a culture centered around decency, with an overall focus on diversity, equity and inclusion ('DEI'), is critical to our business strategy.\n\nSpecifically, to enable our business strategy effectively, our aim is to:\n\n- attract talent with the key skills needed\n- develop and retain an agile workforce that is able to compete in a fast-paced, digitally native and innovative environment and\n- build on our DEI efforts to support our employees",

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to consolidated financial statements\n\n## Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Organization\n\nMastercard Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Mastercard International Incorporated ('Mastercard International' and together with Mastercard Incorporated, 'Mastercard' or the 'Company'), is a technology company in the global payments industry that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses and other organizations  worldwide,  enabling  them  to  use  electronic  forms  of  payment  instead  of  cash  and  checks.  The  Company  makes payments easier and more efficient by providing a wide range of payment solutions and services through its family of well-known and  trusted  brands,  including  Mastercard\u00ae,  Maestro\u00ae  and  Cirrus\u00ae.  The  Company  operates  a  multi-rail  payments  network  that provides choice and flexibility for consumers and merchants. Through its unique and proprietary core global payments network, the Company switches (authorizes, clears and settles) payment transactions. The Company has additional payment capabilities that include  automated  clearing  house  ('ACH')  transactions  (both  batch  and  real-time  account-based  payments).  Using  these capabilities, the Company offers integrated payment products and services and captures new payment flows. The Company's valueadded services include, among others, cyber and intelligence solutions to allow all parties to transact easily and with confidence, as well as other services that provide proprietary insights, drawing on Mastercard's principled use of consumer and merchant data. The Company's franchise model sets the standards and ground-rules that balance value and risk across all stakeholders and allows for interoperability among them. The Company's payment solutions are designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments ecosystem.\n\nMastercard  is  not  a  financial  institution.  The  Company  does  not  issue  cards,  extend  credit,  determine  or  receive  revenue  from interest rates or other fees charged to account holders by issuers, or establish the rates charged by acquirers in connection with merchants' acceptance of the Company's products. In most cases, account holder relationships belong to, and are managed by, the Company's financial institution customers.\n\n## Significant Accounting Policies\n\nConsolidation and basis of presentation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Mastercard and its majorityowned and controlled  entities,  including  any  variable  interest  entities  ('VIEs')  for  which  the  Company  is  the  primary  beneficiary. Investments in VIEs for which the Company is not considered the primary beneficiary are not consolidated and are accounted for as marketable,  equity  method  or  measurement  alternative  method  investments  and  recorded  in  other  assets  on  the  consolidated balance sheet.  At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no significant VIEs which required consolidation and the investments were not considered material to the consolidated financial statements. The Company consolidates acquisitions as of the date on which the Company has obtained a controlling financial interest. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ('GAAP').\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the equity interest not owned by the Company and are recorded for consolidated entities in which the Company owns less than 100% of the interests. Changes in a parent's ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling interest are accounted for as equity transactions, and upon loss of control, retained ownership interests are remeasured at fair value, with any gain or loss recognized in earnings. For 2021, 2020 and 2019, net losses from non-controlling interests were not material and, as a result, amounts are included on the consolidated statement of operations within other income (expense).\n\nUse of estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Future events and their effects  cannot  be  predicted  with  certainty;  accordingly,  accounting  estimates  require  the  exercise  of  judgment.  These  financial statements were prepared using information reasonably available as of December 31, 2021 and through the date of this Report. The accounting estimates used in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the Company's operating environment changes. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nRevenue recognition - Revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects  the  consideration  to  which  the  Company  expects  to  be  entitled  to  in  exchange  for  those  goods  or  services.  Revenue  is primarily  generated  from  assessing  customers  based  on  the  dollar  volume  of  activity,  or  gross  dollar  volume  ('GDV'),  on  the products that carry the Company's brands, from fees to issuers, acquirers and other stakeholders for providing switching services, as well as from value-added products and services that are often integrated and sold with the Company's payment offerings.",

By 2023, the Cyber and Intelligence Solutions were more prominently positioned as a core component of Mastercard\u2019s value proposition, explicitly described as enabling secure, easy, and confident transactions across the global payments ecosystem.

Management's  discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\n\nThe  following  discussion  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  notes  of  Mastercard Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Mastercard International Incorporated ('Mastercard International') (together, 'Mastercard'  or  the  'Company'),  included  elsewhere  in  this  Report.  Percentage  changes  provided  throughout  'Management's Discussion  and Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations'  were  calculated  on  amounts  rounded  to  the  nearest thousand. For discussion related to the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, please see Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\n## Business Overview\n\nMastercard is a technology company in the global payments industry that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital  partners,  businesses  and  other  organizations  worldwide,  enabling  them  to  use  electronic  forms  of  payment instead  of  cash  and  checks.  We  make  payments  easier  and  more  efficient  by  providing  a  wide  range  of  payment  solutions  and services using our family of well-known and trusted brands, including Mastercard\u00ae, Maestro\u00ae and Cirrus\u00ae. We operate a multi-rail payments network that provides choice and flexibility for consumers and merchants. Through our unique and proprietary core global payments  network,  we  switch  (authorize,  clear  and  settle)  payment  transactions.  We  have  additional  payment  capabilities  that include  automated  clearing  house  ('ACH')  transactions  (both  batch  and  real-time  account-based  payments).  Using  these capabilities, we offer integrated payment products and services and capture new payment flows. Our value-added services include, among others, cyber and intelligence solutions to allow all parties to transact easily and with confidence, as well as other services that  provide  proprietary  insights,  drawing  on  our  principled  use  of  consumer  and  merchant  data.  Our  franchise  model  sets  the standards and ground-rules that balance value and risk across all stakeholders and allows for interoperability among them. Our payment solutions are designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments ecosystem.\n\nMastercard is not a financial institution. We do not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from interest rates or other  fees  charged  to  account  holders  by  issuers,  or  establish  the  rates  charged  by  acquirers  in  connection  with  merchants' acceptance of our products. In most cases, account holder relationships belong to, and are managed by, our customers.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nIn  2021, our growth rates, which are at various stages of recovery, increased as compared to the respective year ago period as consumer and business spend recovers and we lap the initial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The following tables provide a summary of trends in our key metrics for 2021 and 2020 as compared to the respective year ago periods:\n\n",

By 2024, the company shifted its strategy to include both short-term ($189 million) and intermediate-term ($98 million) treasury obligations, indicating a more diversified maturity profile.

      "answer": "In 2022, American Express highlighted the challenge of developing compelling value propositions in the face of growing competition, particularly from alternative payment providers and digital wallets, which threatened to fragment customer spending and reduce the competitiveness of its offerings. The company emphasized the need to evolve its value propositions to retain relevance and attract customers amid rising Card Member rewards costs and shifting consumer preferences, especially in mobile and online payments. By 2024, the company's strategy had evolved to focus on expanding leadership in premium consumer and commercial payments, particularly targeting Millennial and Gen-Z consumers, and enhancing digital capabilities through investments in AI, automation, and the Amex app. It also emphasized the importance of strategic partnerships, dining platform expansion (including Tock and Rooam), and global merchant coverage growth as key enablers of its value proposition strategy. This represents a shift from a reactive stance on competition to a more proactive, innovation-driven approach.",

Climate change may exacerbate certain of these threats, including the frequency and severity of weather-related events. Card Members in California, New York, Florida, Texas and Georgia account for a significant portion of U.S. Consumer billed business and Card Members loans, and our results of operations could be impacted by events or conditions that disproportionately or specifically affect one or more of those states.\n\nBecause we derive a portion of our revenues from travel-related spending, our business is sensitive to safety concerns related to travel and tourism, limitations on travel and mobility, and health-related risks, including travel restrictions and bans as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns that additional containment measures may be imposed on short notice and changes in customer behaviors that may continue even after the outbreak has subsided and containment measures are lifted, such as decisions to delay or forgo business or personal travel. In addition, disruptions in air travel and other forms of travel can result in the payment of claims under travel interruption insurance policies we offer.\n\n## Our operating results may materially suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the payments industry.\n\nThe payments industry is highly competitive, and we compete with card networks, issuers and acquirers, paper-based transactions (e.g., cash and checks), bank transfer models (e.g., wire transfers and ACH), as well as evolving and growing alternative payment and financing providers. If we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors, develop compelling value propositions for our customers and/or effectively grow in areas such as mobile and online payments and emerging technologies, we may not be able to compete effectively.\n\nWe believe Visa and Mastercard are larger than we are in most countries based on purchase volume. As a result, card issuers and acquirers on the Visa and Mastercard networks may be able to benefit from the dominant position, scale, resources, marketing and pricing of those networks. Our business may also be negatively affected if we are unable to continue increasing merchant acceptance (including by merchants that accept cards on the Visa and Mastercard networks) and perceptions of coverage, or if our Card Members do not experience welcome acceptance of our cards.\n\nSome of our competitors have developed, or may develop, substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and may offer richer value propositions or a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective strategies to acquire and retain more customers, capture a greater share of spending and borrowings, develop more attractive cobrand card and other partner programs and maintain greater merchant acceptance than we have. We may not be able to compete effectively against these threats or respond or adapt to changes in consumer spending and borrowing habits as effectively as our competitors. Costs such as Card Member rewards and Card Member services expenses could continue to increase as we evolve our value propositions, including in response to increased competition.\n\nSpending on our cards could continue to be impacted by increasing consumer usage of credit and debit cards issued on other networks, as well as adoption of alternative payment mechanisms, systems and products. The fragmentation of customer spending to take advantage of different merchant or card incentives or for convenience with technological solutions may continue to increase. Revolving credit balances on our cards could also be impacted by alternative financing providers, such as point-of-sale lenders and buy now, pay later products. To the extent other payment and financing mechanisms, systems and products continue to successfully expand, our discount revenues earned from Card Member spending and our net interest income earned from Card Member borrowing could be negatively impacted. In addition, companies that control access to consumer and merchant payment method choices at the point of sale or through digital wallets, commerce-related experiences, mobile applications or other technologies could choose not to accept, suppress use of, or degrade the experience of using our products or could restrict our access to our customers and transaction data. Such companies could also require payments from us to participate in such digital wallets, experiences or applications or negotiate incentives or pricing concessions, impacting our profitability on transactions.\n\nThe competitive value of our closed-loop data may also be diminished as traditional and non-traditional competitors use other, new data sources and technologies to derive similar insights. Certain regulations, such as open banking initiatives, could also diminish the value of our closed-loop data or the demand for our products and services by disintermediating existing financial services providers.\n\nTo the extent we expand into new business areas and new geographic regions, such as mainland China, we will face competitors with more experience and more established relationships with relevant customers, regulators and industry participants, which could adversely affect our ability to compete. Laws and business practices that favor local competitors, require card transactions to be routed over domestic networks or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain businesses could limit our growth in international regions. We may face additional compliance and regulatory risks to the extent that we expand into new business areas, and we may need to dedicate more expense, time and resources to comply with regulatory requirements than our competitors, particularly those that are not regulated financial institutions.\n\nMany of our competitors are subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes, and some may have lower cost structures and more agile business models and systems. More restrictive laws and regulations that do not apply to all of our competitors can put us at a disadvantage, including prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions, regulating our business practices or adversely affecting our cost structure.",

      "question": "How has American Express's use and assumptions around the Reasonable and Supportable (R&S) Period evolved between 2022 and 2024 in estimating credit loss reserves, and what does this indicate about the company's approach to financial risk management?",
      "answer": "In 2022, American Express explicitly described its use of the R&S Period as a key component in estimating reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans, incorporating historical loss experience and current/future economic conditions over that period. The reserves stood at $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2021, and the R&S Period was a central assumption in modeling expected credit losses. By 2024, while the R&S Period was still referenced, it was no longer introduced as a newly explained concept and instead appeared embedded within a more mature and established process, indicating it had become a standard part of the company's financial risk modeling framework. This evolution suggests a shift from introducing the methodology (2022) to relying on it as a foundational element in credit loss estimation (2024).",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, the R&S Period was introduced as a key assumption in estimating credit loss reserves, with a specific reserve amount of $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2021.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the R&S Period was referenced in the context of audit procedures but was not re-explained, indicating it had become an established part of the company\u2019s financial risk modeling.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a transformation from introducing the R&S Period as a novel concept in 2022 to treating it as a standard, embedded assumption in 2024, showing the evolution of the company\u2019s credit loss estimation methodology."

Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Reserves for Credit Losses on Card Member Loans\n\nAs described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans represent management's estimate of the expected credit losses in the Company's outstanding portfolio of Card Member loans as of the balance sheet date. The reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans was $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2021. Management estimates lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience, as well as current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period (R&amp;S Period) beyond the balance sheet date. As disclosed by management, in estimating expected credit losses, management uses a combination of statistically-based models that entail a significant amount of judgment. The primary areas of judgment used in measuring the quantitative components of the Company's reserves relate to the determination of the appropriate R&amp;S Period, the modeling of the probability of and exposure at default, and the methodology to incorporate current and future economic conditions. Management uses these models and assumptions, combined with historical loss experience, to determine the reserve rates that are applied to the outstanding loan balances to produce its reserves for expected credit losses. Within the R&amp;S Period, the Company's models use past loss experience and current and future economic conditions to estimate the probability of default, exposure at default and expected recoveries to estimate net losses at default. Beyond the R&amp;S Period, expected credit losses are estimated by immediately reverting to long-term average loss rates. Management also estimates the likelihood and magnitude of recovery of previously written off loans considering how long ago the loan was written off and future economic conditions. Additionally, management evaluates whether to include qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but may not be adequately represented in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. The qualitative reserves address possible limitations within the models or factors not included within the models, such as external conditions, emerging portfolio trends, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due accounts, or management risk actions.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans is a critical audit matter are (i) the estimate of the reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans involved significant judgment by management, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the models, significant inputs, qualitative reserves, and significant assumptions, including the R&amp;S Period and the loss rates used to estimate expected credit losses beyond the R&amp;S Period and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans. These procedures also included, among others, testing management's process for estimating the reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans through (i) evaluating the appropriateness of management's methodology, (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of significant inputs and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of certain qualitative reserves and significant assumptions used to estimate the reserves. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of management's methodology and the reasonableness of certain qualitative reserves and certain significant assumptions, including the R&amp;S Period and the loss rates used to estimate expected credit losses beyond the R&amp;S Period.",

The Membership Rewards liability was $14.8 billion as of December 31, 2024. The weighted average cost (WAC) per point and the Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR) are key assumptions used to estimate the liability. As disclosed by management, the URR assumption is used by management to estimate the number of points earned that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods. Management uses statistical and actuarial models to estimate the URR based on redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, card spend levels and credit attributes. The WAC per point assumption is derived from 12 months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations and expected developments in redemption patterns.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Membership Rewards liability is a critical audit matter are (i) the estimate of the URR involved significant judgment by management, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the audit evidence relating to the models, significant inputs and assumptions used by management and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

      "answer": "In 2022, AIG generally gave significant weight to expected loss ratio methods for guaranteed cost business only in the most recent accident year, while for excess of deductible business, these methods were given significant weight in the most recent five accident years. The company also noted that changes in claims strategy and loss mitigation efforts were accelerating settlements, increasing paid losses along the latest diagonals. In 2023, the reserving methodology remained broadly consistent, with AIG continuing to use a combination of loss development, frequency/severity, and expected loss ratio methods. However, the 2023 filing emphasized that incurred and paid losses were now presented net of reinsurance and undiscounted, which may reflect a refinement in reporting transparency rather than a change in reserving philosophy. Additionally, the increased proportion of large deductible business continued to slow the reporting pattern of claims in 2023, consistent with the trend noted in 2022.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## Reserving Process and Methodology\n\nU.S. Workers' Compensation is an extremely long-tail line of business, with loss emergence extending for decades. We generally use a combination of loss development, frequency/severity and expected loss ratio methods for workers' compensation.\n\nMany of our workers compensation policies contain risk-sharing features, including high deductibles, self-insured retentions or retrospective rating features, in addition to a traditional insurance component. These risk-sharing programs generally are large and complex, comprising multiple products, years and structures, and are subject to amendment over time. We group guaranteed cost and excess of deductible business separately and then further by state and industry subset to the extent that meaningful differences are determined to exist. We also separately analyze certain subsets of the portfolio that have unique characteristics (e.g., U.S. government sub-contractor accounts and construction wrap-up business). For excess of deductible business, we also segment by size of deductible and whether the claim is handled by AIG or an outside third-party administrator. The proportion of large deductible business has increased over time, which has slowed the reporting pattern of claims.\n\nFor guaranteed cost business, expected loss ratio methods generally are given significant weight only in the most recent accident year. Workers' compensation claims are generally characterized by high frequency, low severity, and relatively consistent loss development from one accident year to the next. We historically have been a leading writer of workers' compensation, and thus have sufficient volume of claims experience to use development methods. We generally segregate California (CA) and New York (NY) businesses from the other states to reflect their different development patterns and changing percentage of the mix by state. The claims development tables above are impacted by two other significant initiatives, which offset each other. In recent years, we instituted claims strategy changes and loss mitigation efforts to accelerate settlements, which we believe results in an overall reduction in claim costs. This strategy resulted in an increase in paid losses along the latest diagonals relative to prior years. In addition, we have been reducing premium volume in recent years and shifting a greater proportion of business to insured risk retention structures such as high deductible policies. These mix and volume changes slowed paid and incurred development since excess of deductible claims will typically take longer to emerge and settle.\n\nExpected loss ratio methods for business written in excess of a deductible may be given significant weight in the most recent five accident years. In the 2016 analysis, we increased our tail factor estimates for states other than NY and CA for guaranteed cost business in recognition of longer medical development patterns that we have been seeing in recent years. We reflected increases in legal costs we have seen across the portfolio, particularly in California. The expected loss ratios used for recent accident years are based on the projected ultimate loss ratios for older years adjusted for rate changes, loss trend including inflation, and where appropriate, changing market conditions.\n\nAdditionally, over the years we have written a number of very large accounts which include workers' compensation coverage. These accounts are generally individually priced by our actuaries, and to the extent appropriate, the indicated losses based on the pricing analysis may be used to record the initial estimated loss reserves for these accounts. Recent COVID-19 related events have caused disruption in claims frequency and severity as well as reporting patterns. Where appropriate and identifiable, adjustments have been made to standard projection techniques. Changes in Claims organization management, differing referral and review criteria and other factors may also be expected to alter loss emergence.\n\n258 AIG | 2021 Form 10-K",

U.S. Special Risk products include aerospace, environmental, political risk, trade credit, surety and marine insurance, and program business for various small and medium sized enterprises insurance lines. The program segments include both property and casualty exposures. Recent years have seen an increasing proportion of non-admitted coverages which has altered the underlying customer profile to be less severe in the aggregate.\n\nWe primarily segment our analysis by line of business. Additionally, we separately review various subsets, including hull, cargo, and liability for marine business, aviation and satellite for aerospace business, and various other specific programs and product lines.\n\nFrequency/severity methods, loss development methods, and IBNR factor methods are used alone or in combination to set reserves for short-tail classes such as U.S. Property.\n\nIBNR factor methods are used when the nature of losses is low frequency/high severity. The IBNR factors, when applied to earned premium, generate the ultimate expected losses (or other exposure measure) yet to be reported. The factors are determined based on prior accident quarters' loss costs adjusted to reflect current cost levels and the historical emergence of those loss costs. The factors are continually reevaluated to reflect emerging claim experience, rate changes, loss trends including inflation, or other factors that could affect the adequacy of the IBNR factor being employed.\n\nWe generally use a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for aviation exposures. Aviation claims are not very long-tail in nature; however, they are driven by claim severity. Thus a combination of both development and expected loss ratio methods is used for all but the latest accident year to determine the loss reserves. Frequency/severity methods are not employed due to the high severity nature of the claims and different mix of claims from year to year.\n\nFor program business, we use methods which vary by line of business. For property classes, we use methods similar to those noted above. For liability classes, we use methods similar to those described in the casualty sections detailed above.\n\nExpected loss ratio methods are used to determine the loss reserves for the latest accident year. We also use ground-up claim projections provided by our claims staff to assist in developing the appropriate reserve.\n\n## U.S. Personal Insurance\n\nDuring 2021, we recognized $412 million of favorable prior year development in U.S. Personal Insurance, net of external reinsurance but before ADC cessions, mainly due to favorable development and subrogation recoveries from the 2017 and 2018 catastrophe years.\n\nDuring 2020, we recognized $94 million of unfavorable prior year development in U.S. Personal Insurance, net of external reinsurance but before ADC cessions, mainly due to large losses in Homeowners and Umbrella.\n\nDuring 2019, we recognized $96 million of favorable prior year development in U.S. Personal Insurance driven largely by subrogation recoverable on the 2017 California wildfires and favorable development from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria.\n\nAIG | 2021 Form 10-K 271",

U.S. Special Risk products include aerospace, environmental, political risk, trade credit, surety and marine insurance, and program business for various small and medium sized enterprises insurance lines. The program segments include both property and casualty exposures. Recent years have seen an increasing proportion of non-admitted coverages which has altered the underlying customer profile to be less severe in the aggregate.\n\nWe primarily segment our analysis by line of business. Additionally, we separately review various subsets, including hull, cargo, and liability for marine business, aviation and satellite for aerospace business, and various other specific programs and product lines.\n\nFrequency/severity methods, loss development methods, and IBNR factor methods are used alone or in combination to set reserves for short-tail classes such as U.S. Property.\n\nIBNR factor methods are used when the nature of losses is low frequency/high severity. The IBNR factors, when applied to earned premium, generate the ultimate expected losses (or other exposure measure) yet to be reported. The factors are determined based on prior accident quarters' loss costs adjusted to reflect current cost levels and the historical emergence of those loss costs. The factors are continually reevaluated to reflect emerging claim experience, rate changes, loss trends including inflation, or other factors that could affect the adequacy of the IBNR factor being employed.\n\nWe generally use a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for aviation exposures. Aviation claims are not very long-tail in nature; however, they are driven by claim severity. Thus a combination of both development and expected loss ratio methods is used for all but the latest accident year to determine the loss reserves. Frequency/severity methods are not employed due to the high severity nature of the claims and different mix of claims from year to year.\n\nFor program business, we use methods which vary by line of business. For property classes, we use methods similar to those noted above. For liability classes, we use methods similar to those described in the casualty sections detailed above.\n\nExpected loss ratio methods are used to determine the loss reserves for the latest accident year. We also use ground-up claim projections provided by our claims staff to assist in developing the appropriate reserve.\n\n## U.S. Personal Insurance\n\nDuring 2021, we recognized $412 million of favorable prior year development in U.S. Personal Insurance, net of external reinsurance but before ADC cessions, mainly due to favorable development and subrogation recoveries from the 2017 and 2018 catastrophe years.\n\nDuring 2020, we recognized $94 million of unfavorable prior year development in U.S. Personal Insurance, net of external reinsurance but before ADC cessions, mainly due to large losses in Homeowners and Umbrella.\n\nDuring 2019, we recognized $96 million of favorable prior year development in U.S. Personal Insurance driven largely by subrogation recoverable on the 2017 California wildfires and favorable development from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria.\n\nAIG | 2021 Form 10-K 271",

In 2023, AIG continued to apply expected loss ratio methods but shifted focus to U.S. Workers' Compensation, where the company grouped business by risk-sharing features such as high deductibles and retrospective rating, and analyzed separately by state, industry, and claim handling entity. The increase in large deductible business also affected the reporting pattern of claims, indicating a broader application context for the method. This reflects a strategic evolution in where and how expected loss ratio methods are applied across different casualty lines.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## Reserving Process and Methodology\n\nU.S. Excess Casualty policies tend to attach at a high layer above underlying policies, which causes the loss development pattern to be lagged significantly. Many of the claims notified to the excess layers are closed without payment because the claims never reach our layer as a result of high deductibles and other underlying coverages, while the claims that reach our layer can have large case reserves or settlements and be highly variable in terms of reported timing and amount. For a portion of this business, the underlying primary policies are issued by other insurance companies, which can limit our access to relevant information to help inform our judgments as the loss events evolve and mature. Furthermore, this coverage is often significantly impacted by the underwriting cycle and external judicial trends.\n\nRecent accident years reflect a strategy towards having higher attachment points on the portfolio through changing participations in various layers within an insured's program.\n\nWe generally use a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for excess casualty product lines. We segment our analysis between automobile-related claims and non-automobile claims, due to the shorter-tail nature of the automobile claims. We then further segment the non-automobile claims for certain latent exposures such as construction defects and mass torts where losses have unique emergence patterns. Mass tort claims in particular may develop over an extended period of time and impact multiple accident years when they emerge. The more standard types of claims are then separately analyzed based on attachment point bands, to recognize that the impact of the level of the attachment point can significantly impact the delay in loss reporting and development. In our analyses, losses capped at $10 million were first analyzed using traditional loss development and expected loss ratio methods and then this estimate was used to derive the expected loss estimate for losses above $10 million reflecting the expected relationships between the layers, reflecting the attachment point and limit.\n\nExpected loss ratio methods are generally used for at least the three latest accident years, due to the relatively low credibility of the reported losses. The loss experience is generally reviewed separately by attachment point. The expected loss ratios used for recent accident years are based on the projected ultimate loss ratios for older years adjusted for rate changes, loss trend including inflation, and where appropriate, changing market conditions. Recent COVID-19 related events have caused disruption in claims frequency and severity as well as reporting patterns. Where appropriate, and identifiable, adjustments have been made to standard projection techniques.\n\n## U.S. Other Casualty\n\nU.S Other Casualty includes general liability, commercial auto, medical malpractice, and various other casualty lines of business.\n\nIn 2021, we recognized $1 million of favorable prior year development in Other Casualty, net of external reinsurance but before ADC cessions.\n\nIn 2020, we recognized $141 million of favorable prior year development in Other Casualty, net of external reinsurance but before ADC cessions.\n\nAIG | 2021 Form 10-K 261",

Mastercard connects consumers, financial i ns EtuEons,  merchants,  governments,  digital  partners,  businesses  and  other  organizaEons  worldwide  by  enabling  electronic  payments  and  making  those payment  transacEons  secure,  simple,  smart  and  accessible. The  Company  makes  payments  easier  and  more  efficient  by  providing  a  wide  range  of  payment s ol uEons  and  services  using  its  family  of  well-known  and  trusted  brands,  including  Mastercard\u00ae,  Maestro\u00ae  and  Cirrus\u00ae. The  Company  operates  a  payments network that provides choice and flexibility for consumers, merchants and Mastercard customers.  Through its unique and proprietary global payments network, the  Company  switches  (authorizes,  clears  and  seNles)  payment  transacEons. The  Company  has  addiEonal  payments  capabiliEes  that  include  automated cl e a ri ng hous e ('ACH') tra ns a cEons  (both ba tch a nd rea l-Eme a ccount-based payments).  Using these capabiliEes, the Company offers consumer and commercial payment  products,  captures  new  payment  flows  and  provides  services  and  soluEons.  The  Company's  services  and  soluEons  include,  among  others,  security s ol uEons, consumer acquisiEon and engagement services, and business and market insights, all of which draw on Mastercard's principled and responsible use of secure data. The Company's capabiliEes strengthen, reinforce and complement each other and are fundamentally interdependent.  For the global payments network, Mastercard's franchise model sets the standards and ground-rules that balance value and risk across all stakeholders and allows for interoperability among them. The Company employs a multi-layered approach to help protect the global payments ecosystem in which it operates.\n\nMastercard is not a financial institution. The Company does not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from interest rates or other fees charged to account holders by issuers, or establish the rates charged by acquirers in connecEon with merchants' acceptance of the Company's products.  In most cases, account holder relationships belong to, and are managed by, the Company's financial institution customers.\n\n## Significant Accounting Policies\n\nConsolida'on and basis of presenta'on -  The  cons ol i da te d fina nci a l  s ta te me nts  i ncl ude  the  a ccounts  of Ma s terca rd a nd i ts  ma jori ty-owned a nd controlled enEEes , i ncl udi ng a ny va ri a bl e  i nte re s t e nEEe s  ('VIEs ') for whi ch the  Compa ny is  the prima ry beneficia ry.  Investments in VIEs for which the Company is not considered the primary beneficiary are not consolidated and are accounted for as marketable, equity method or measurement alternaEve method investments and recorded i n  other  a s s e ts   on  the   cons ol i da te d  ba l a nce   s he e ts .    At  De ce mbe r  31,  2024  a nd  2023,  there  were  no  s i gni fica nt  VIEs   tha t  requi red  cons ol i da Eon  a nd  the i nves tments  were not considered material to the consolidated financial statements.  The  Company consolidates acquisiEons as of the date the  Company has obtained a  controlling  financial  interest.  Intercompany  transacEons  and  balances  have  been  eliminated  in  consolidaEon.  Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2024 presentaEon.  The reclassificaEon had no impact on previously reported net revenue, operaEng income or net income. The Company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ('GAAP').\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the equity interest not owned by the Company and are recorded for consolidated enEEes in which the Company owns less than 100% of the interests. Changes in a parent's ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling interest are accounted for as equity transacEons, and upon loss of control, retained ownership interests are remeasured at fair value, with any gain or loss recognized in earnings. For 2024, 2023 and 2022, net i ncome/(losses)  aNributable  to  non-controlling  interests  were  not  material  and,  as  a  result,  amounts  are  included  on  the  consolidated  statements  of operations within other income (expense).\n\nUse of es'mates -  The   pre pa ra Eon  of  fina nci a l   s ta te me nts   i n  conformi ty  wi th  GAAP  re qui re s   ma na ge ment  to  ma ke  es Ema tes   a nd  a s s umpEons   tha t  a ffect  the reported amounts of assets and liabiliEes and disclosure of conEngent assets and liabiliEes at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of  revenue  and  expenses  during  the  reporEng  periods. Future  events  and  their  effects  cannot  be  predicted  with  certainty;  accordingly,  accounEng  esEmates require the exercise of judgment. These financial statements were prepared using informaEon reasonably available as of December 31, 2024 and through the date of this Report. The accounEng esEmates used in the preparaEon of the Company's consolidated financial statements may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as addiEonal informaEon is obtained and as the Company's operaEng environment changes.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nRevenue recogni'on -  Re ve nue  i s   re cogni ze d  to  de pi ct  the   tra ns fe r  of  promi s e d  s e rvi ce s   to  cus tome rs   i n  a n  a mount  tha t  re fle cts   the   cons i de ra Eon  to  whi ch  the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services.\n\n71 MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K",

      "question": "How has Mastercard's relationship with Dynamic Yield LTD evolved between 2023 and 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's strategic focus during this period?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Mastercard disclosed that it had acquired Dynamic Yield LTD in April 2022 for $325 million, with $200 million of goodwill attributed to synergies expected after the acquisition. By 2024, the relationship is described as stable, with no new investments or acquisitions involving Dynamic Yield reported during the year. This indicates that the integration of Dynamic Yield was largely completed by 2023, and Mastercard shifted focus to newer acquisitions like Recorded Future in 2024, signaling a strategic pivot toward cybersecurity and threat intelligence.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, Mastercard disclosed the acquisition of Dynamic Yield LTD in April 2022 for $325 million, with $200 million in goodwill primarily attributed to expected synergies.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, Dynamic Yield is mentioned as part of the prior year's acquisitions, with no new activity or changes to the relationship, indicating it is now fully integrated.",
        "Step 3: The lack of new developments with Dynamic Yield, contrasted with the acquisition of Recorded Future in 2024, suggests a strategic evolution from personalization technology to cybersecurity capabilities."

      "question": "How did the status and disclosure of Class B-2 Common Stock evolve between 2023 and 2024, particularly regarding its outstanding status and relationship to other stock classes?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Class B-2 Common Stock was subject to conversion rate adjustments tied to the U.S. litigation escrow account under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, which caused dilution in as-converted shares. Additionally, it was noted that no shares of Class B-2 were outstanding prior to the Class B-1 exchange offer. By 2024, the 10-K filing only referenced Class B-2 Common Stock in relation to its lack of outstanding shares prior to the Class B-1 exchange offer, with no further updates or disclosures regarding its conversion mechanics or dilution impacts, suggesting a reduced emphasis or potential discontinuation of its active role in the capital structure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 (2023) \u2014 Class B-2 Common Stock was subject to dilution through conversion rate adjustments due to escrow deposits and was linked to the Class B-1 exchange offer.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 (2024) \u2014 Class B-2 Common Stock was only mentioned in a historical context, noting it had no outstanding shares prior to the Class B-1 exchange, with no new disclosures on its current status.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change \u2014 The nature of the disclosures shifted from active financial mechanics in 2023 to a passive historical reference in 2024, indicating a transformation in its relevance or presence within the company's equity structure."

      "answer": "In 2023, Visa conducted an exchange offer where 241 million shares of Class B-1 common stock were tendered, and in exchange, approximately 48 million shares of Class C common stock were issued. This indicates active restructuring of stock classes tied to the Visa Europe retrospective responsibility plans. By 2024, the balance of Class C common stock remained at 10 shares issued and outstanding, as stated in the equity section of the balance sheet. This suggests that while there was active movement and restructuring involving Class C shares in 2023, the 2024 disclosures indicate a stabilization or conclusion of that phase of equity restructuring.",

      "question": "How did The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's approach to restricted stock unit agreements evolve between the 2023 and 2024 filings, particularly in terms of the lifecycle management of these equity instruments and their implications for executive compensation strategy?",
      "answer": "In the 2023 filing, the '2024 Form of Restricted Stock Unit Agreement' was newly introduced and explicitly stated as 'Filed herewith,' indicating it was a current and newly adopted form for that year. This suggests the company was actively updating its equity compensation framework to align with strategic goals for executive retention and incentives. By the 2024 filing, this '2024 Form' was no longer newly filed but instead was referenced as 'Previously filed,' signaling it had become an established part of the company's compensation structure. Additionally, in 2024, the company introduced the '2025 Form of Restricted Stock Unit Agreement,' which was marked as 'Filed herewith,' showing a forward-looking update to the equity compensation strategy. This evolution indicates a consistent, proactive approach to managing executive compensation frameworks, with new forms being introduced annually and the prior year\u2019s forms transitioning into reference documents. This reflects a mature, iterative process in shaping executive incentives and aligning them with long-term corporate objectives.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, the '2024 Form of Restricted Stock Unit Agreement' was newly filed, indicating the introduction of updated compensation instruments.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the same '2024 Form' was referenced as previously filed, while a new '2025 Form' was introduced as newly filed, showing a transition in lifecycle management.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a deliberate, forward-looking approach to equity compensation, with annual updates and lifecycle progression from active filing to reference status."

In 2024, while the Code remained accessible, it was referenced more generally as part of a broader list of governance materials available on the company\u2019s website, including committee charters and governance guidelines, without repeating the direct URL.

      "answer": "In 2023, BNY Mellon included accounting developments among a broader list of potential influences on forward-looking statements, noting they 'may impact our businesses' without specific elaboration. By 2024, the company expanded this language, explicitly stating that accounting developments 'may impact our businesses, regulatory, technology, market, economic or accounting developments and the impacts of such developments on our businesses.' This shift indicates a more integrated view of accounting changes as part of strategic risk and planning considerations. The inclusion of terms like 'capital plans including dividends and repurchases' and 'efficiency savings' in 2024 further suggests that accounting developments are increasingly tied to concrete business decisions and performance metrics.",

In the 2024 filing, the Dividend Reinvestment Plan was again referenced in the context of officer or director participation, but the detailed explanation of Rule 10b5-1 and non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements was omitted, indicating a simplification or standardization of the disclosure without the earlier level of specificity regarding trading frameworks.",

          "chunk_text": "## Reserving Process and Methodology\n\nU.S. Property products include commercial, industrial and energy-related property insurance products and services that cover exposures to manmade and natural disasters, including business interruption. U.S. Special Risk products include aerospace, environmental, political risk, trade credit, surety and marine insurance, and program business for various small and medium sized enterprises insurance lines. The program segments include both property and casualty exposures. Recent years have seen an increasing proportion of non-admitted coverages which has altered the underlying customer profile to be less severe in the aggregate.\n\nWe primarily segment our analysis by line of business. Additionally, we separately review various subsets, including hull, cargo, and liability for marine business, aviation and satellite for aerospace business, and various other specific programs and product lines.\n\nFrequency/severity methods, loss development methods, and IBNR factor methods are used alone or in combination to set reserves for short-tail classes such as U.S. Property.\n\nIBNR factor methods are used when the nature of losses is low frequency/high severity. The IBNR factors, when applied to earned premium, generate the ultimate expected losses (or other exposure measure) yet to be reported. The factors are determined based on prior accident quarters' loss costs adjusted to reflect current cost levels and the historical emergence of those loss costs. The factors are continually reevaluated to reflect emerging claim experience, rate changes, loss trends including inflation, or other factors that could affect the adequacy of the IBNR factor being employed.\n\nWe generally use a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for aviation exposures. Aviation claims are not very long-tail in nature; however, they are driven by claim severity. Thus a combination of both development and expected loss ratio methods is used for all but the latest accident year to determine the loss reserves. Frequency/severity methods are not employed due to the high severity nature of the claims and different mix of claims from year to year.\n\nFor program business, we use methods which vary by line of business. For property classes, we use methods similar to those noted above. For liability classes, we use methods similar to those described in the casualty sections detailed above.\n\nExpected loss ratio methods are used to determine the loss reserves for the latest accident year. We also use ground-up claim projections provided by our claims staff to assist in developing the appropriate reserve.\n\n## U.S. Personal Insurance\n\nDuring 2021, we recognized $412 million of favorable prior year development in U.S. Personal Insurance, net of external reinsurance but before ADC cessions, mainly due to favorable development and subrogation recoveries from the 2017 and 2018 catastrophe years.\n\nDuring 2020, we recognized $94 million of unfavorable prior year development in U.S. Personal Insurance, net of external reinsurance but before ADC cessions, mainly due to large losses in Homeowners and Umbrella.\n\nDuring 2019, we recognized $96 million of favorable prior year development in U.S. Personal Insurance driven largely by subrogation recoverable on the 2017 California wildfires and favorable development from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria.\n\nAIG | 2021 Form 10-K 271",

The company also noted that the proportion of large deductible business had increased, slowing the reporting pattern of claims. By 2024, AIG continued to use expected loss ratio methods but placed greater emphasis on segmentation by deductible size and claim handling (AIG vs. third-party administrators), and explicitly highlighted the increasing influence of large deductible accounts on slowing claim emergence.

We generally use a combination of loss development, frequency/severity and expected loss ratio methods for workers' compensation.\n\nMany of our workers compensation policies contain risk-sharing features, including high deductibles, self-insured retentions or retrospective rating features, in addition to a traditional insurance component. These risk-sharing programs generally are large and complex, comprising multiple products, years and structures, and are subject to amendment over time. We group guaranteed cost and excess of deductible business separately and then further by state and industry subset to the extent that meaningful differences are determined to exist. We also separately analyze certain subsets of the portfolio that have unique characteristics (e.g., U.S. government sub-contractor accounts and construction wrap-up business). For excess of deductible business, we also segment by size of deductible and whether the claim is handled by AIG or an outside third-party administrator. The proportion of large deductible business has increased over time, which has slowed the reporting pattern of claims.\n\nFor guaranteed cost business, expected loss ratio methods generally are given significant weight only in the most recent accident year. Workers' compensation claims are generally characterized by high frequency, low severity, and relatively consistent loss development from one accident year to the next. We historically have been a leading writer of workers' compensation, and thus have sufficient volume of claims experience to use development methods. We generally segregate California (CA) and New York (NY) businesses from the other states to reflect their different development patterns and changing percentage of the mix by state. The claims development tables above are impacted by two other significant initiatives, which offset each other. In recent years, we instituted claims strategy changes and loss mitigation efforts to accelerate settlements, which we believe results in an overall reduction in claim costs. This strategy resulted in an increase in paid losses along the latest diagonals relative to prior years. In addition, we have been reducing premium volume in recent years and shifting a greater proportion of business to insured risk retention structures such as high deductible policies. These mix and volume changes slowed paid and incurred development since excess of deductible claims will typically take longer to emerge and settle.\n\nExpected loss ratio methods for business written in excess of a deductible may be given significant weight in the most recent five accident years. In the 2016 analysis, we increased our tail factor estimates for states other than NY and CA for guaranteed cost business in recognition of longer medical development patterns that we have been seeing in recent years. We reflected increases in legal costs we have seen across the portfolio, particularly in California. The expected loss ratios used for recent accident years are based on the projected ultimate loss ratios for older years adjusted for rate changes, loss trend including inflation, and where appropriate, changing market conditions.\n\nAdditionally, over the years we have written a number of very large accounts which include workers' compensation coverage. These accounts are generally individually priced by our actuaries, and to the extent appropriate, the indicated losses based on the pricing analysis may be used to record the initial estimated loss reserves for these accounts. Recent COVID-19 related events have caused disruption in claims frequency and severity as well as reporting patterns. Where appropriate and identifiable, adjustments have been made to standard projection techniques. Changes in Claims organization management, differing referral and review criteria and other factors may also be expected to alter loss emergence.\n\n258 AIG | 2021 Form 10-K",

These product lines generally are offered on a claims-made basis and losses are characterized by low frequency and high severity. In general, expected loss ratio methods are given more weight in the more recent accident years and loss development methods are given more weight in more mature accident years. The loss development factors for the different segments differ significantly in some cases, based on specific coverage characteristics and other factors such as industry group, attachment points, and limits offered.\n\nFrequency/severity methods are generally not used in isolation for these product lines as the overall losses are driven by large losses more than by claim frequency. For commercial D&amp;O segments though, we reflect claims dismissal rates in our frequency estimates, particularly for securities class action suits, as claims severity varies directly with claims jurisprudence. Severity trends have varied significantly from accident year to accident year and care is required in analyzing these trends by claim type. In view of the changing severity profile of the book, we use a capped and excess layer approach on many segments to better reflect the potential impact of large claims on the results by accident year.\n\nWe generally use loss development methods for fidelity exposures for all but the latest accident year. For mergers and acquisitions exposure, given the unique profile of each transaction, we use claim department estimates of the ultimate value of each reported claim to supplement and inform the standard actuarial approaches and some weight is given to this method in the more recent accident years.\n\nExpected loss ratio methods are also given weight for the more recent accident years. IBNR factor methods are used, when the nature of losses is low frequency/high severity. The IBNR factors, when applied to earned premium, generate the ultimate expected losses (or other exposure measure) yet to be reported. The factors are determined based on prior accident quarters' loss costs adjusted to reflect current cost levels and the historical emergence of those loss costs. The factors are continually reevaluated to reflect emerging claim experience, rate changes, loss trends including inflation, or other market and underwriting strategy factors that could affect the adequacy of the IBNR factor being employed. Recent COVID-19 related events have caused disruption in claims frequency and severity as well as reporting patterns. Where appropriate, and identifiable, adjustments have been made to standard projection techniques. Also, many subsets of the business have experienced significant re-underwriting efforts and planned turnover which could likely lead to differing emergence patterns over time. Changes in Claims management, differing referral and review criteria, and other factors may also be expected to alter loss emergence.\n\n## U.S. Property and Special Risks\n\nDuring 2021, we recognized $172 million of unfavorable prior year development in U.S. Property and Special Risks driven largely by the impact of reductions in reinsurance recoveries driven by changes in catastrophe loss estimates.\n\nDuring 2020, we recognized $80 million of favorable prior year development in U.S. Property and Special Risks driven largely by attritional property and favorable emergence on specialty losses coming in better than expected.\n\nDuring 2019, we recognized $204 million of favorable prior year development in U.S. Property and Special Risks driven largely by favorable development on the 2017 Hurricanes (Harvey, Irma, Maria) as well as subrogation recoverable on the 2017 California wildfires and by favorable emergence on non-Catastrophe Commercial Property, Program and Specialty classes.\n\n268 AIG | 2021 Form 10-K",

Reported claims for losses from assumed reinsurance contracts are not available and hence not included in the reported claims.\n\nThere are limitations that should be considered on the reported claim count data in the tables below, including:\n\n- -Claim counts are presented only on a reported (not an ultimate) basis;\n- -The tables below include lines of business and geographies at a certain aggregated level which may indicate different frequency and severity trends and characteristics, and may not be as meaningful as the claim count information related to the individual products within those lines of business and geographies;\n- -Certain lines of business are more likely to be subject to occurrences involving multiple claimants and features, which can distort measures based on the reported claim counts in the table below; and\n- -Reported claim counts are not adjusted for ceded reinsurance, which may distort the measure of frequency or severity.\n\nSupplemental Information: The information about incurred and paid loss development for all periods preceding the year ended December 31, 2024 and the related historical claims payout percentage disclosure is unaudited and is presented as supplementary information.\n\nThe following tables present undiscounted, incurred and paid losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses by accident year, on a net basis after reinsurance, with a separate presentation of the ADC excluding the related amortization of the deferred gain:\n\n## U.S. Workers' Compensation\n\nU.S. Workers' Compensation is an extremely long-tail line of business, with loss emergence extending for decades. We generally use a combination of loss development, frequency/severity and expected loss ratio methods for workers' compensation.\n\nMany of our workers compensation policies contain risk-sharing features, including high deductibles, self-insured retentions or retrospective rating features, in addition to a traditional insurance component. These risk-sharing programs generally are large and complex, comprising multiple products, years and structures, and are subject to amendment over time. We group guaranteed cost and excess of deductible business separately and then further by state and industry subset to the extent that meaningful differences are determined to exist. We also separately analyze certain subsets of the portfolio that have unique characteristics (e.g., U.S. government subcontractor accounts and construction wrap-up business). For excess of deductible business, we also segment by size of deductible and whether the claim is handled by AIG or an outside third-party administrator. The proportion of large deductible business has increased over time, which has slowed the reporting pattern of claims.\n\n## Incurred Losses and Allocated Loss Adjustment Expenses, Undiscounted and Net of Reinsurance\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, Capital One originated multifamily commercial real estate loans with the intent to sell them to GSEs, entering into loss sharing agreements, which resulted in a liability of $82 million. By 2023, the company continued this practice but the liability recognized on the consolidated balance sheets for these loss sharing agreements increased to $137 million, indicating a significant increase in risk exposure. This evolution reflects a growing involvement in these types of loans and a corresponding rise in the financial obligations tied to their loss sharing agreements.",

Our lending activities are governed under our credit policy and are subject to independent review and approval. Below we provide information about the composition of our loan portfolio, key concentrations and credit performance metrics.\n\nWe also engage in certain non-lending activities that may give rise to ongoing credit and counterparty settlement risk, including purchasing  securities  for  our  investment  securities  portfolio,  entering  into  derivative  transactions  to  manage  our  market  risk exposure  and  to  accommodate  customers,  extending  short-term  advances  on  syndication  activity  including  bridge  financing transactions  we  have  underwritten,  depositing  certain  operational  cash  balances  in  other  financial  institutions,  executing  certain foreign  exchange  transactions  and  extending  customer  overdrafts.  We  provide  additional  information  related  to  our  investment securities  portfolio  under  'MD&amp;A-Consolidated  Balance  Sheets  Analysis-Investment  Securities'  and  credit  risk  related  to derivative transactions in 'Note 9-Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.'\n\n## Primary Loan Products\n\nWe provide  a  variety  of  lending  products.  Our  primary  loan  products  include  credit  cards,  auto  loans  and  commercial  lending products.\n\n- Credit cards: We originate both prime and subprime credit cards through a variety of channels. Our credit cards generally have variable interest rates. Credit card accounts are primarily underwritten using an automated underwriting system based on predictive models that we have developed. The underwriting criteria, which are customized for individual products and marketing programs, are established based on an analysis of the net present value of expected revenues, expenses and losses, subject to further analysis using a variety of stress conditions. Underwriting decisions are generally based on credit bureau information, including payment history, debt burden and credit scores, such as FICO scores, and on other factors, such as applicant income. We maintain a credit card securitization program and selectively sell charged-off credit card loans.\n- Auto: We originate both prime and subprime auto loans through a network of auto dealers and direct marketing. Our auto loans generally have fixed interest rates and loan terms of 75 months or less, but can go up to 84 months. Loan size limits are customized by program and are generally less than $75,000. Similar to credit card accounts, the underwriting criteria are customized for individual products and marketing programs and based on analysis of net present value of expected revenues, expenses and losses, and are subject to maintaining resilience under a variety of stress conditions. Underwriting decisions are  generally  based  on  an  applicant's  income,  estimated  net  disposable  income,  and  credit  bureau  information  including FICO scores, along with collateral characteristics such as loan-to-value ('LTV') ratio. We maintain an auto securitization program.\n- Commercial: We offer a range of commercial lending products, including loans secured by commercial real estate and loans to middle market commercial and industrial companies. Our commercial loans may have a fixed or variable interest rate; however, the majority of our commercial loans have variable rates. Our underwriting standards require an analysis of the borrower's financial condition and prospects, as well as an assessment of the industry in which the borrower operates. Where relevant, we evaluate and appraise underlying collateral and guarantees. We maintain underwriting guidelines and limits for major types of borrowers and loan products that specify, where applicable, guidelines for debt service coverage, leverage, LTV ratio and standard covenants and conditions. We assign a risk rating and establish a monitoring schedule for loans based on the risk profile of the borrower, industry segment, source of repayment, the underlying collateral and guarantees, if any, and  current  market  conditions.  Although  we  generally  retain  the  commercial  loans  we  underwrite,  we  may  syndicate positions  for  risk  mitigation  purposes,  including  bridge  financing  transactions  we  have  underwritten.  In  addition,  we originate and service multifamily commercial real estate loans which are sold to government-sponsored enterprises.\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)",

      "answer": "In 2022, securitized debt obligations were explicitly described as one of the company's key funding sources alongside deposits, senior and subordinated notes, federal funds purchased, and FHLB advances. By 2023, while still present in the funding structure at $18.043 billion in carrying value, securitized debt obligations were categorized under Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, indicating a shift toward more standardized valuation methods. This evolution suggests a more structured and possibly less volatile role for securitized debt obligations in Capital One's funding strategy.",

        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1: In 2022, securitized debt obligations were highlighted as a core funding source among several others, indicating strategic importance in Capital One's capital structure.",

        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change: The shift from a general description of securitized debt obligations as a funding source in 2022 to a more specific classification in 2023 suggests a refinement in how these instruments are managed and valued, indicating a structural evolution."

      "answer": "In 2022, Capital One used credit score data for product segmentation decisions based on historical credit score distributions from 2020 to 2021, as shown in Table 21. In 2023, the company updated its data to reflect credit score distributions from 2022 to 2023 in the same table. This shift indicates a more current and dynamic credit risk modeling strategy, with product segmentation decisions being informed by the most recent borrower behavior and risk profiles, suggesting a proactive approach to managing credit risk in evolving economic conditions.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, Capital One referenced credit score data from 2020\u20132021 in Table 21 to inform product segmentation decisions.",

        "Step 3: The change reflects an evolution in credit risk modeling, where Capital One shifted toward using more recent data for segmentation, likely improving the responsiveness of its risk assessment framework."

Trends in delinquency rates are the key credit quality indicator for our credit card and retail banking loan portfolios as changes in delinquency rates can provide an early warning of changes in potential future credit losses. The key indicator we monitor when assessing the credit quality and risk of our auto loan portfolio is borrower credit scores as they provide insight into borrower risk profiles, which give indications of potential future credit losses. The key credit quality indicator for our commercial loan portfolios is our internal risk ratings as we generally classify loans that have been delinquent for an extended period of time and other loans with significant risk of loss as nonperforming. In addition to these credit quality indicators, we also manage and monitor other credit quality metrics such as level of nonperforming loans and net charge-off rates.\n\nWe underwrite most consumer loans using proprietary models, which typically include credit bureau data, such as borrower credit scores, application information and, where applicable, collateral and deal structure data. We continuously adjust our management of credit lines and collection strategies based on customer behavior and risk profile changes. We also use borrower credit scores for subprime classification, for competitive benchmarking and, in some cases, to drive product segmentation decisions.\n\nTable 21 provides details on the credit scores of our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Table 21: Credit Score Distribution\n\n",

      "question": "How did Capital One's use of securitized debt obligations evolve between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of their role in the company's funding mix and their fair value classification?",
      "answer": "In 2022, securitized debt obligations were described as a key component of Capital One's diversified funding strategy, used alongside deposits, senior and subordinated notes, federal funds purchased, and FHLB advances to maintain access to wholesale funding sources. By 2023, the company disclosed that the carrying value of securitized debt obligations was $18,043 million, with an estimated fair value of $18,067 million, all classified under Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. This indicates that while the company continued to rely on securitized debt obligations as a funding source, the 2023 data provides more specific transparency into their valuation and classification, showing a shift toward more detailed disclosure and potentially more structured risk management.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, securitized debt obligations were mentioned as part of the diversified funding mix, highlighting their importance in maintaining access to wholesale funding sources.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the company provided specific figures for securitized debt obligations, including a carrying value of $18,043 million and a fair value of $18,067 million, all classified under Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.",
        "Step 3: The evolution from a general description of securitized debt obligations as part of the funding strategy in 2022 to a more detailed and quantified disclosure in 2023 reflects increased transparency and a more structured approach to reporting these obligations."

COBNA  and  CONA  were  well-capitalized,  as  defined  under  the  federal  banking regulatory  guidelines,  as  of  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  respectively.  See  'Part  I-Item  1.

We  provide  additional  information  on  the  composition  of  deposits  in  'MD&amp;AConsolidated Balance Sheets Analysis-Funding Sources Composition' and in 'Note 8-Deposits and Borrowings.'\n\n## Funding\n\nOur primary source of funding comes from deposits, as they are a stable and relatively low cost source of funding. In addition to deposits, we raise funding through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes and securitized debt obligations, federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase and FHLB advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios. A key objective in our use of these markets is to maintain access to a diversified mix of wholesale funding sources. See 'MD&amp;A-Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis-Funding Sources Composition' for additional information on our primary sources of funding.\n\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments that affect our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Our future cash outflows primarily relate to deposits, borrowings and operating leases. The actual timing and amounts of future cash payments may vary over time due to a number of factors, such as discretionary debt repurchases.\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)",

          "chunk_text": "\n## U.S. Covered Litigation\n\n## Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) - Putative Class Actions\n\nBeginning in May 2005, a series of complaints (the majority of which were styled as class actions) were filed in U.S. federal district courts by merchants against Visa U.S.A., Visa International and/or Mastercard, and in some cases, certain U.S. financial institutions. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued an order transferring the cases to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Court) for coordination of pre-trial proceedings in MDL 1720. A group of purported class plaintiffs subsequently filed amended and supplemental class complaints. The individual and class complaints generally challenged, among other things, Visa's and Mastercard's purported setting of interchange reimbursement fees, their 'no surcharge' and honor-all-cards rules, alleged tying and bundling of transaction fees, and Visa's  reorganization  and  IPO,  under  the  federal  antitrust  laws  and,  in  some  cases,  certain  state  unfair  competition laws. The complaints sought money damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, attorneys' fees and, in one instance, an order that the IPO be unwound.\n\nVisa Inc., Visa U.S.A., Visa International, Mastercard Incorporated, Mastercard International Incorporated, various U.S.  financial  institution  defendants,  and  the  class  plaintiffs  signed  a  settlement  agreement  (2012  Settlement Agreement) to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims. Pursuant to the 2012 Settlement Agreement, the Company deposited approximately  $4.0  billion  from  the  U.S.  litigation  escrow  account  and  approximately  $500  million  attributable  to interchange  reductions  for  an  eight-month  period  into  court-authorized  settlement  accounts.  Visa  subsequently received  from  the  Court  and  deposited  into  the  Company's  U.S.  litigation  escrow  account  'takedown  payments'  of approximately  $1.1  billion.  On  June  30,  2016,  the  U.S.  Court  of Appeals  for  the  Second  Circuit  vacated  the  lower court's certification of the merchant class, reversed the approval of the settlement, and remanded the case to the lower court for further proceedings.\n\nOn remand, the district court entered an order appointing interim counsel for two putative classes of plaintiffs, a 'Damages Class' and an 'Injunctive Relief Class.' The plaintiffs purporting to act on behalf of the putative Damages Class  subsequently  filed  a  Third  Consolidated  Amended  Class  Action  Complaint,  seeking  money  damages  and attorneys' fees, among other relief. A new group of purported class plaintiffs, acting on behalf of the putative Injunctive Relief  Class,  filed  a  class  action  complaint  against  Visa,  Mastercard,  and  certain  bank  defendants  seeking,  among other things, an injunction against the setting of default interchange rates; against certain Visa operating rules relating to  merchants,  including  the  honor-all-cards  rule;  and  against  various  transaction  fees,  including  the  fixed  acquirer network fee, as well as attorneys' fees.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Uses of Liquidity\n\nPayments  settlement. Payments  settlement  due  to  and  from  our  financial  institution  clients  can  represent  a substantial daily liquidity requirement. Most U.S. dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance, while settlements in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions. In general, during fiscal 2022, we were not required to fund settlement-related working capital. As of September 30, 2022, we held $9.2 billion of  our  total  available  liquidity  to  fund  daily  settlement  in  the  event  one  or  more of our financial institution clients are unable to settle, with the remaining liquidity available to support our working capital and other liquidity needs. See Note 12-Settlement  Guarantee  Management to  our  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in Item  8-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report .\n\nLitigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation  or  other  fines  imposed  in  investigations  and  proceedings, other than the U.S. covered litigation and VE territory covered litigation, which are covered by the U.S. and Europe retrospective responsibility plans, could give rise to future liquidity needs. During fiscal 2022, we deposited $850 million into  the  U.S.  litigation  escrow  account  to  address  claims  associated  with  the  interchange  multidistrict  litigation.  The balance  of  this  account  as  of  September  30,  2022  was  $1.4  billion  and  is  reflected  as  restricted  cash  in  our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 5-U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20-Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.\n\nCommon stock repurchases. During fiscal 2022, we repurchased shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $11.6 billion. As of September 30, 2022, our repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $5.2 billion.  In  October  2022,  our  board  of  directors  authorized  a  new  $12.0  billion  share  repurchase  program.  Share repurchases will be executed at prices we deem appropriate subject to various factors, including market conditions and our  financial  performance,  and  may  be  effected  through  accelerated  share  repurchase  programs,  open  market purchases  or  privately  negotiated  transactions,  including  through  Rule  10b5-1  plans.  See Note  15-Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.\n\nDividends .  During  fiscal  2022,  we  declared  and  paid  $3.2  billion  in  dividends  to  holders  of  our  common  and preferred stock. On October 21, 2022, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.45 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series A, B and C convertible participating preferred stock on an as-converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $950 million in connection with this  dividend  on  December  1,  2022.  See Note  15-Stockholders'  Equity to  our  consolidated  financial  statements included  in Item  8-Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data of  this  report.  We  expect  to  continue  paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. All preferred and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends.\n\nCapital expenditures. During fiscal 2022, our capital expenditures increased. We expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure.\n\nSenior notes. As of September 30, 2022, we had an outstanding aggregate principal amount relating to our senior notes of $22.9 billion. During fiscal 2022, we repaid $1.0 billion of principal upon maturity of certain senior notes. A principal payment on certain senior notes of $2.3 billion is due in December 2022, for which we have sufficient liquidity. As of September 30, 2022, we allocated $243 million to eligible green projects from the $500 million green bond issued as part of our commitment to environmental sustainability and a sustainable payments ecosystem. See Note 10-Debt to our  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in Item  8-Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data of  this report.\n\nClient  incentives. As  of  September  30,  2022,  we  had  short-term  and  long-term  liabilities  recorded  on  the consolidated  balance  sheet  related  to  these  agreements  of  $6.1  billion  and  $0.2  billion,  respectively.  See Note  1Summary  of  Significant  Accounting  Policies to  our  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in Item  8-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.\n\nUncertain tax positions. As of September 30, 2022, we had long-term liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $1.8 billion. See Note 19-Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.",

      "question": "How has Visa's approach to managing litigation liabilities through loss sharing agreements evolved between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of the scope of U.S. covered litigation and liability allocation?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Visa detailed specific amendments to its loss sharing agreement, including the October 2015 amendment that expanded the scope of U.S. covered litigation to include opt-out actions from the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class in MDL 1720 that arose out of similar facts or circumstances. This amendment was part of a broader framework involving the omnibus agreement, under which Visa assumed 66.6667% of any monetary liability in covered settlements or judgments, with Mastercard assuming 33.3333%. In 2023, Visa consolidated its approach under the U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan, which now encompasses the loss sharing agreement as part of a broader set of mechanisms designed to address potential liabilities from U.S. covered litigation. Notably, the 2023 filing emphasizes that U.S. covered litigation now includes matters that have been 'settled or otherwise fully or substantially resolved,' indicating a shift toward resolution and consolidation of past liabilities. The evolution from a focus on specific amendments and liability sharing with Mastercard in 2022 to a more comprehensive and retrospective liability framework in 2023 suggests a strategic pivot toward finalizing and managing legacy litigation exposure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Visa disclosed amendments to the loss sharing agreement, notably the October 2015 update expanding the scope of U.S. covered litigation and the liability split with Mastercard under the omnibus agreement (66.6667% Visa, 33.3333% Mastercard).",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the loss sharing agreement is described as part of the broader U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan, with an emphasis on settled or substantially resolved cases, indicating a shift in focus from active liability management to retrospective resolution.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a strategic evolution from active litigation risk sharing and expansion of liability scope in 2022 to a more consolidated and retrospective approach in 2023, suggesting Visa is moving toward closure on legacy litigation matters."

The amendment includes within the scope of U.S. covered litigation any action brought after the amendment by an opt-out from the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class in MDL 1720 that arises out of facts or circumstances substantially similar to those alleged in MDL 1720  and  that  is  not  transferred  to  or  otherwise  included  in  MDL  1720.  On  the  same  date,  Visa  entered  into amendments to the interchange judgment sharing agreement and omnibus agreement that include any such action within the scope of those agreements as well.\n\nOmnibus agreement. Visa entered into an omnibus agreement with Mastercard and certain Visa U.S.A. members that confirmed and memorialized the signatories' intentions with respect to the loss sharing agreement, the interchange judgment sharing agreement and other agreements relating to the interchange multidistrict litigation, see Note 20Legal Matters. Under the omnibus agreement, the monetary portion of any settlement of the interchange multidistrict litigation  covered  by  the  omnibus  agreement  would  be  divided  into  a  Mastercard  portion  at  33.3333%  and  a  Visa portion at 66.6667%. In addition, the monetary portion of any judgment assigned to Visa-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement would be treated as a Visa portion. Visa would have no liability for the monetary portion of any judgment assigned to Mastercard-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement, and if a judgment is not assigned to Visa-related claims or Mastercard-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement, then any monetary liability would be divided into a Mastercard portion at 33.3333% and a Visa portion at 66.6667%. The Visa portion of a settlement or judgment covered by the omnibus agreement would be allocated in accordance with specified provisions  of  the  Company's  U.S.  retrospective  responsibility  plan.  The  litigation  provision  on  the  consolidated statements of operations was not impacted by the execution of the omnibus agreement.\n\nOn August  26,  2014,  Visa  entered  into  an  amendment  to  the  omnibus  agreement.  The  omnibus  amendment makes applicable to certain settlements in opt-out cases in the interchange multidistrict litigation the settlement-sharing provisions  of  the  omnibus  agreement,  pursuant  to  which  the  monetary  portion  of  any  settlement  of  the  interchange multidistrict litigation covered by the omnibus agreement would be divided into a Mastercard portion at 33.3333% and a Visa  portion  at  66.6667%.  The  omnibus  amendment  also  provides  that  in  the  event  of  termination  of  the  class settlement agreement, Visa and Mastercard would make mutually acceptable arrangements so that Visa shall have received two-thirds and Mastercard shall have received one-third of the total of (i) the sums paid to defendants as a result of the termination of the settlement agreement and (ii) the takedown payments previously made to defendants.\n\n## Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan\n\nUK  loss  sharing  agreement. The  Company  has  entered  into  a  loss  sharing  agreement  with  Visa  Europe  and certain of Visa Europe's member financial institutions located in the United Kingdom (UK LSA members). Each of the UK LSA members has agreed, on a several and not joint basis, to compensate the Company for certain losses which may be incurred by the Company, Visa Europe or their affiliates as a result of certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting and implementation of domestic multilateral interchange fee rates in the United Kingdom prior to the  closing  of  the  Visa  Europe  acquisition  (Closing),  subject  to  the  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  therein  and,  with respect to each UK LSA member, up to a maximum amount of the up-front cash consideration received by such UK LSA member. The UK LSA members' obligations under the UK loss sharing agreement are conditional upon, among other things, either (a) losses valued in excess of the sterling equivalent on June 21, 2016 of \u20ac1.0 billion having arisen in UK covered claims (and such losses having reduced the conversion rate of the series B preferred stock accordingly), or (b) the conversion rate of the series B preferred stock having been reduced to zero pursuant to losses arising in claims relating to multilateral interchange fee rate setting in the Visa Europe territory.\n\nLitigation  management  deed. The  Company  has  entered  into  a  litigation  management  deed  with  Visa  Europe which sets forth the agreed upon procedures for the management of the VE territory covered litigation, the allocation of losses resulting from this litigation (VE territory covered losses) between the series B and C preferred stock, and any accelerated  conversion  or  reduction  in  the  conversion  rate  of  the  shares  of  series  B  and  C  preferred  stock.  The litigation  management  deed  applies  only  to  VE  territory  covered  litigation  (and  resultant  losses  and  liabilities).  The litigation management deed provides that the Company will generally control the conduct of the VE territory covered litigation, subject to certain obligations to report and consult with the litigation management committee for VE territory covered litigation (VE Territory Litigation Management Committee).

      "question": "How has Mastercard's use of short duration foreign exchange derivative contracts evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of their role in managing foreign exchange risk during daily settlement activities?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Mastercard used short duration foreign exchange derivative contracts to manage foreign exchange risk associated with daily settlement activities, aiming to reduce exposure to volatility from currency fluctuations on anticipated receipts and disbursements. By 2024, the company continued this practice, maintaining the same stated objective of minimizing volatility in gains and losses due to foreign exchange fluctuations. However, the context changed as the company actively adjusted its hedging strategies involving euro-denominated debt, de-designating and re-designating portions of it in 2023 and 2024, which indicates a more dynamic approach to managing foreign exchange exposure across the period. The continuity in the use of short duration contracts contrasts with the evolving structure of the company\u2019s broader foreign exchange risk management strategy.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2022, the company disclosed its use of short duration foreign exchange derivative contracts to manage FX risk from daily settlement activities, with the goal of reducing volatility from currency fluctuations.",
        "In 2024, the company still used these contracts for the same purpose but also made active adjustments to its euro-denominated debt hedges, including de-designating \u20ac400 million in 2024 and \u20ac109 million in 2023, with part re-designated in 2024.",
        "The use of short duration FX derivatives remained consistent, but the broader FX risk management strategy evolved, suggesting a more dynamic approach to hedging foreign exchange exposures over time."

Changes in fair value of these contracts and changes in fair value of fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in the hedged benchmark interest rate generally offset each other and are recorded in interest expense on the consolidated statement of  operations. Gains or losses related to the net settlements of interest rate swaps are also recorded in interest expense on the consolidated  statement  of  operations.  The  periodic  cash  settlements  are  included  in  operating  activities  on  the  consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\nDuring  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  the  Company  entered  into  an  interest  rate  swap  designated  as  a  fair  value  hedge  related  to $1.0 billion of the 3.850% Senior Notes due March 2050. In effect, the interest rate swap synthetically converts the fixed interest rate on this debt to a variable interest rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ('SOFR') Overnight Index Swap Rate. The net impact to interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was not material.\n\n## Net Investment Hedges\n\nThe Company may use foreign currency denominated debt and/or foreign exchange derivative contracts to hedge a portion of its net investment in foreign subsidiaries against adverse movements in exchange rates. The effective portion of the net investment hedge is recorded as a currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Forward points are designated as an excluded component and recognized in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations over the hedge period. The amounts recognized in earnings related to forward points for 2021 were not material.\n\nIn  2015,  the  Company  designated  its  \u20ac1.65  billion  euro-denominated  debt  as  a  net  investment  hedge  for  a  portion  of  its  net investment in its European operations. During 2021, 2020 and 2019 the Company recorded a pre-tax net foreign currency gain of $155 million, loss of $177 million and gain of $36 million, respectively, in other comprehensive income (loss).\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had a net foreign currency gain of $34 million and loss of $175 million, after tax, respectively, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) associated with this hedging activity.\n\n## Non-designated Derivatives\n\nThe Company may also enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to serve as economic hedges, such as to offset possible changes in the value of monetary assets and liabilities due to foreign exchange fluctuations, without designating these derivative contracts  as  hedging  instruments.  In  addition,  the  Company  is  subject  to  foreign  exchange  risk  as  part  of  its  daily  settlement activities. This risk is typically limited to a few days between when a payment transaction takes place and the subsequent settlement with customers. To manage this risk, the Company may enter into short duration foreign exchange derivative contracts based upon anticipated  receipts  and  disbursements  for  the  respective  currency  position.  The  objective  of  these  activities  is  to  reduce  the Company's exposure to volatility arising from gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against its functional currencies.  Gains  and  losses  resulting  from  changes  in  fair  value  of  these  contracts  are  recorded  in  general  and  administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations, net, along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities.\n\nMASTERCARD 2021 FORM 10-K 109",

      "answer": "In 2022, Mastercard's multi-layered security approach included a robust program to protect its network from cyber and information security threats, with multiple layers of protection and third-party assessments. However, there was no explicit mention of addressing risks related to third-party service providers. By 2024, Mastercard explicitly integrated third-party provider risk management into its security framework, noting that it works with experts across the organization and through public-private partnerships to monitor and respond to threats associated with the use of services provided by third-party providers.

We also provide switched transaction services to customers where the merchant country and the country of issuance are the same ('domestic transactions'). We switch over 60% of all transactions for Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards, including nearly all cross-border transactions.\n\nWe guarantee the settlement of many of the transactions from issuers to acquirers to ensure the integrity of our core network. We refer to the amount of this guarantee as our settlement exposure. We do not, however, guarantee payments to merchants by their acquirers or the availability of unspent prepaid account holder account balances.\n\nCore Network Architecture. Our core network features a globally integrated structure that provides scale for our issuers, enabling them to expand into regional and global markets. It is based largely on a distributed (peer-to-peer) architecture that enables the network to adapt to the needs of each transaction. The network accomplishes this by performing intelligent routing and applying multiple  value-added  services  (such  as  fraud  scoring,  tokenization  services,  etc.)  to  appropriate  transactions  in  real  time.  This architecture  enables  us  to  connect  all  parties  regardless  of  where  or  how  the  transaction  is  occurring.  It  has  24-hour  a  day availability and world-class response time.\n\n## Additional Payment Capabilities\n\nACH  Batch  and  Real-Time  Account-Based  Payments  Infrastructure  and  Applications. We  offer  ACH  batch  and  real-time account-based  payments  capabilities,  enabling  payments  for  ACH  transactions  between  bank  accounts  in  real-time.  These capabilities  provide  consumers  and  businesses  the  ability  to  make  instant  (faster)  payments  while  providing  enhanced  data  and messaging  capabilities.  We  build,  implement,  enhance  and  operate  real-time  clearing  and  settlement  infrastructure,  payment platforms and direct debit systems for jurisdictions globally. As of December 31, 2021, we either operated or were implementing realtime payments infrastructure in 12 of the top 50 markets as measured by GDP. We also apply our real-time payments capabilities to new payment flows, such as consumer bill payments using our real-time bill pay solutions.\n\nAccount to Account. We enable consumers, businesses, governments and merchants to send and receive money directly from account to account. We apply these capabilities to help these stakeholders with various disbursements and remittances.\n\nWe discuss below under 'Our Payment Products and Applications' the ways in which we apply our real-time account-based and account to account payment capabilities to capture new payment flows.\n\n## Security and Franchise\n\nPayments System Security. We have a multi-layered approach to protect the global payments ecosystem. As part of this approach, we have a robust program to protect our network from cyber and information security threats. Our network and platforms incorporate multiple layers of protection, providing greater resiliency and best-in-class security protection. Our programs are assessed by third parties and incorporate benchmarking and other data from peer companies and consultants. We engage in many efforts to mitigate information  security  challenges,  including  maintaining  an  information  security  program,  an  enterprise  resilience  program  and insurance coverage, as well as regularly testing our systems to address potential vulnerabilities. Through the combined efforts of our Security Operations Centers, Fusion Centers and the Mastercard Intelligence Center, we work with experts across the organization (as  well  as  through  other  sources  such  as  public-private  partnerships)  to  monitor  and  respond  quickly  to  a  range  of  cyber  and physical threats.\n\nAs  another  feature  of  our  multi-layered  approach  to  protect  the  global  payments  ecosystem,  we  work  with  issuers,  acquirers, merchants,  governments  and  payments  industry  associations  to  develop  and  put  in  place  technical  standards  (such  as  EMV standards for chips and smart payment cards) for safe and secure transactions and we provide solutions and products that are designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments ecosystem. We discuss specific cyber and intelligence solutions that we offer to our customers in 'Our Value-Added Services'.\n\nOur Franchise. We manage an ecosystem of stakeholders that participate in our network and payments platforms. Our franchise creates and sustains a comprehensive series of value exchanges across our ecosystem. We ensure a balanced ecosystem where all participants benefit from the availability, innovation, safety and security of our network. We achieve this through the following key activities:\n\n- Participant Onboarding. We ensure the capability of new customers to use our network and define the roles and responsibilities for their operations once on the network\n- Safety and Security. We establish the core principles, including ensuring consumer protections and integrity, so participants feel confident to transact on the network\n- Operating Standards.

Loans that are more than 30 days past due prov ide an early warning of borrowers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and/or who may be unable or unwilling to repay the loan. As the loan continues to age, it becomes more clear whether the borrower is likely to be unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of residential real estate loans, late-stage delinquencies (greater than 150 days past due) are a strong indicator of loans that will ultimately result in a foreclosure or similar liquidation transaction. In addition to delinquency rates, other credit quality indicators for consumer loans v ary based on the class of loan, as follows:\n\n- For residential real estate loans, the current estimated LTV ratio, or the combined LTV ratio in the case of junior lien loans, is an indicator of the potential loss sev erity in the ev ent of default. Additionally, LTV or combined LTV ratios can prov ide insight into a borrower's continued willingness to pay, as the delinquency rate of high-LTV loans tends to be greater than that for loans where the borrower has equity in the collateral. The geographic distribution of the loan collateral also prov ides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio, as factors such as the regional economy, home price changes and specific ev ents such as natural disasters, will affect credit quality. The borrower's current or 'refreshed' FICO score is a secondary credit quality indicator for certain loans, as FICO scores are an indication of the borrower's credit payment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower with a low FICO score (less than 660) is considered to be of higher risk than a loan to a borrower with a higher FICO score. Further, a loan to a borrower with a high LTV ratio and a low FICO score is at greater risk of default than a loan to a borrower that has both a high LTV ratio and a high FICO score.\n- For scored auto and business banking loans, geographic distribution is an indicator of the credit performance of the portfolio. Similar to residential real estate loans, geographic distribution prov ides insights into the portfolio performance based on regional economic activ ity and ev ents.",

      "answer": "In 2023, JPMorgan Chase emphasized that its resolution plan obligations could lead to higher funding costs and constrained liquidity due to the need to satisfy liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements, as well as regulatory demands outside the U.S. regarding liquidity pre-positioning in subsidiaries. The firm highlighted the potential need to rely on more expensive or limited alternative funding sources if traditional ones like deposits or Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings were reduced. In 2024, the firm expanded its disclosures to include how resolution plan obligations interacted with dynamic regulatory expectations and systemic events, noting that changes in laws, rules, and regulations\u2014especially in response to economic effects of systemic events\u2014could further impact liquidity and capital requirements. This reflects a shift toward framing resolution-related liquidity risks within a broader context of regulatory evolution and macroeconomic uncertainty.",

          "chunk_text": "## Part I\n\n- have business profiles, models or strategies that could cause their ability to meet their obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions.\n\nFor example, a significant deterioration in the credit quality of a counterparty, borrower or other obligor could lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of other counterparties, borrowers or obligors in similar, related or dependent industries. This type of interrelationship could exacerbate JPMorganChase's credit, liquidity and market risk exposure and potentially cause it to incur losses, including fair v alue losses in its market-making businesses and inv estment portfolios. In addition, JPMorganChase may be required to increase the allowance for credit losses or establish other reserv es with respect to certain clients, industries or country exposures in order to align with directiv es or expectations of its banking regulators.\n\nSimilarly, challenging economic conditions that affect a particular industry or geographic area could lead to concerns about the credit quality of counterparties, borrowers or other obligors not only in that particular industry or geography but in related or dependent industries, wherev er located. These conditions could also heighten concerns about the ability of customers of JPMorganChase's consumer businesses who live in those areas or work in those affected industries or related or dependent industries to meet their obligations to JPMorganChase. JPMorganChase regularly monitors v arious segments of its credit and market risk exposures to assess the potential risks of concentration or contagion, but its ability to div ersify or hedge its exposure against those risks may be limited.\n\nJPMorganChase's consumer businesses can also be harmed by an excessive expansion of consumer credit by bank or non-bank competitors. Heightened competition for certain types of consumer loans could prompt industry-wide reactions such as significant reductions in the pricing or margins of those loans or the making of loans to less-creditworthy borrowers. If large numbers of consumers subsequently default on their loans, whether due to weak credit profiles, an economic downturn or other factors, this could impair their ability to repay obligations owed to JPMorganChase and result in higher charge-offs and other credit-related losses. More broadly, widespread defaults on consumer debt could lead to recessionary conditions in the U.S. economy, and JPMorganChase's consumer businesses may earn lower rev enues in such an env ironment.\n\nIf JPMorganChase is unable to reduce positions effectiv ely during a market dislocation, this can increase both the market and credit risks associated with those positions and the lev el of risk-weighted-assets ('RWA') that JPMorganChase holds on its balance sheet. These factors could adv ersely affect JPMorganChase's capital position, funding costs and the profitability of its businesses.\n\n## Liquidity\n\nJPMorganChase's ability to operate its businesses could be impaired if its  liquidity is  cons trained.\n\nJPMorganChase's liquidity can be impacted at any giv en time as a result of factors such as:\n\n- market-wide illiquidity or disruption\n- changes in liquidity or capital requirements resulting from changes in laws, rules and regulations, including those in response to economic effects of systemic ev ents\n- actions taken by the U.S. gov ernment or by the Federal Reserv e to reduce its balance sheet, which may reduce deposits held by JPMorganChase and other financial institutions\n- inability to sell assets, or to sell assets at fav orable times or prices\n- default by a CCP or other significant market participant\n- unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral\n- unexpected loss of deposits or higher than anticipated draws on lendingrelated commitments, and\n- lack of market or customer confidence in JPMorganChase or financial institutions in general.\n\nA reduction in JPMorganChase's liquidity may be caused by ev ents ov er which it has little or no control. For example, periods of market stress, low inv estor confidence and significant market illiquidity could result in higher funding costs for JPMorganChase and could limit its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity.\n\nJPMorganChase may need to raise funding from alternativ e sources if its access to stable and lower-cost sources of funding, such as deposits and borrowings from Federal Home Loan Banks, is reduced. Alternativ e sources of funding could be more expensiv e or limited in av ailability. JPMorganChase's funding costs could also be negativ ely affected by actions that JPMorganChase may take in order to:\n\n- satisfy applicable liquidity cov erage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements\n- address obligations under its resolution plan, or\n- satisfy regulatory requirements in jurisdictions outside the U.S. relating to the pre-positioning of liquidity in subsidiaries that are material legal entities.\n\nMore generally, if JPMorganChase fails to effectiv ely manage its liquidity, this could constrain its ability to fund or inv est in its businesses and subsidiaries, and thereby adv ersely affect its results of operations.",

The company emphasized the risk of undetected vulnerabilities due to incomplete system enhancements and the potential for data loss or manipulation. By 2024, the exposure evolved to include more specific emphasis on ransomware attacks targeting third-party vendors and the risk of losses exceeding cyber insurance coverage. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase noted increased complexity in recovering from data theft or destruction, with a new concern around the inability to prevent systems from processing fraudulent transactions. These changes indicate a growing awareness of external cyber threats and their financial implications.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MET's investment in Municipals was valued at $14,212 million and primarily categorized under 'Estimated Fair Value' without a detailed breakdown of valuation hierarchy levels. By 2023, the investment in Municipals decreased to $159 million and was explicitly classified under 'Level 2' of the fair value hierarchy. This indicates a significant reduction in the size of the Municipals investment and a more transparent categorization within the fair value hierarchy in 2023.",

        "Step 1: Identify the state of Municipals investment in 2022, which was reported at $14,212 million under 'Estimated Fair Value' without specific hierarchy levels.",

        "Step 3: Analyze the change, noting a significant decrease in value and a shift toward more granular fair value classification in 2023."

      "answer": "In 2022, MET's Level 3 Fixed Maturity Securities AFS included $1 million in Corporate bonds, $1 million in Foreign Bonds, and $11 million in Equity Securities. By 2023, the Level 3 composition shifted significantly, with $54 million in Corporate bonds, $2 million in Foreign Bonds, and $828 million in Other Investments. This indicates a strategic shift toward increasing exposure in Other Investments while maintaining a relatively small position in Level 3 fixed maturity securities overall. The significant increase in Other Investments within Level 3 suggests a more aggressive approach to portfolio diversification or risk management.",

        "Step 1: Identify the composition and values of Level 3 Fixed Maturity Securities AFS in 2022, which included $1 million in Corporate bonds, $1 million in Foreign Bonds, and $11 million in Equity Securities.",

        "Step 3: Analyze the change in composition to characterize the shift in investment strategy, noting the significant increase in Other Investments and the relatively minor changes in other categories."

      "answer": "In 2022, Fixed Maturity Securities AFS accounted for 84% of U.S. Pension Benefits and 95% of U.S. Other Postretirement Benefits. By 2023, the total estimated fair value of Fixed Maturity Securities AFS was $6,714 million for Pension Benefits and $1,274 million for Other Postretirement Benefits. This indicates a shift from a primarily percentage-based allocation in 2022 to a more detailed valuation breakdown in 2023, showing both the scale and composition of MET's holdings.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, MET's allocation to Fixed Maturity Securities AFS was reported as a percentage of total assets for both U.S. Pension Benefits (84%) and U.S. Other Postretirement Benefits (95%).",
        "Step 2: In 2023, MET reported the total estimated fair value of Fixed Maturity Securities AFS in dollar amounts: $6,714 million for Pension Benefits and $1,274 million for Other Postretirement Benefits, with further categorization by security type and valuation hierarchy.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a shift from reporting allocations as percentages in 2022 to disclosing detailed fair value estimates and composition in 2023, indicating a more granular and transparent approach to asset reporting."

      "answer": "In 2022, MET held $14,212 million in municipals, classified under the 'fixed maturity securities AFS' category, with a fair value that included $2,464 million in gross unrealized gains and only $13 million in gross unrealized losses. By 2023, this investment had significantly declined to just $159 million, now categorized under the 'fixed maturity securities AFS' and classified entirely within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, indicating a shift in MET's positioning. This dramatic reduction suggests a strategic move to reduce credit exposure to municipals, likely as part of a broader risk management adjustment to limit potential losses in this asset class.",

      "answer": "In 2023, the First Mortgages and HELOCs portfolio included $100 million in unamortized premiums, discounts, and direct origination costs, with 43% of the portfolio concentrated in California. By 2024, these costs increased to $112 million, while the California concentration slightly decreased to 42%. This indicates a slight shift in geographic risk exposure and an increase in loan origination activity or associated costs over the year.",

        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in 2023 \u2014 Origination costs were $100 million and 43% of the portfolio was in California.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in 2024 \u2014 Origination costs increased to $112 million and California's share dropped to 42%.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change \u2014 The portfolio saw a moderate increase in origination costs and a minor decrease in California concentration, suggesting a slight geographic diversification and increased investment in loan origination."

      "answer": "In 2023, securities issuances by CSC were identified as a primary source of capital, directly supporting the company's capital management strategy, which included balance sheet growth and financial support to subsidiaries. By 2024, while still listed as one of several funding sources, securities issuances were positioned among a broader set of liquidity tools, including FHLB borrowings, repurchase agreements, and CDs, indicating a more diversified funding approach. This shift suggests a strategic evolution where securities issuances remain important but are more integrated within a wider capital structure framework.",

          "chunk_text": "## THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\n## Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\n\nSchwab's EVE profile is characterized by a more stable asset duration relative to liabilities in both higher and lower interest rate environments. Currently, the EVE exposure to rates increasing or decreasing in a similar magnitude shows that there is greater exposure to rates decreasing.\n\n## Bank Deposit Account Fees Simulation\n\nConsistent with the presentation on the consolidated statement of income, the sensitivity of bank deposit account fee revenue to interest rate changes is assessed separately from the net interest revenue simulation described above. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, simulated changes in bank deposit account fee revenue from gradual changes in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates, under the interest rate scenarios described above for net interest revenue, did not have a significant impact on the Company's total net revenues. Our net interest revenue, EVE, and bank deposit account fee revenue simulations reflect the assumption of non-negative investment yields.\n\n## Liquidity Risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the potential that Schwab will be unable to sell assets or meet cash flow obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable losses.\n\nDue to its role as a source of financial strength, CSC's liquidity needs are primarily driven by the liquidity and capital needs of: CS&amp;Co, our principal broker-dealer subsidiary; the capital needs of the banking subsidiaries; principal and interest due on corporate debt; and dividend payments on CSC's preferred and common stock. The liquidity needs of our broker-dealer subsidiary are primarily driven by client activity, including trading and margin lending activities, and capital expenditures. The capital needs of the banking subsidiaries are primarily driven by client deposit levels and other borrowings. We have established liquidity policies to support the successful execution of business strategies, while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity to meet operational needs and satisfy applicable regulatory requirements under both normal and stressed conditions. We seek to maintain client confidence in the balance sheet and the safety of client assets by maintaining liquidity and diversity of funding sources to allow the Company to meet its obligations. To this end, we have established limits and contingency funding plans to support liquidity levels during both business as usual and stressed conditions.\n\nWe employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity. We conduct regular liquidity stress testing to develop a view of liquidity risk exposures and to ensure our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity during market-related or company-specific liquidity stress events. Liquidity sources are also tested periodically and results are reported to the Financial Risk Oversight Committee. A number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify emerging liquidity stresses in the market or within the organization and are reviewed with management periodically.\n\n## Funding Sources\n\nSchwab's primary source of funds is cash generated by client activity which includes bank deposits and cash balances in client brokerage accounts. These funds are used to purchase investment securities and extend loans to clients. Other sources of funds may include cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities, repayments on loans, securities lending of assets held in client brokerage accounts, FHLB borrowings, borrowings under repurchase agreements with external financial institutions, issuance of CDs, cash provided by securities issuances by CSC in the capital markets, and other facilities described below.\n\nTo meet daily funding needs, we maintain liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and short-term investments. For unanticipated liquidity needs, we also maintain a buffer of highly liquid investments, including U.S. Treasury securities. Our clients' bank deposits and brokerage cash balances primarily originate from our 36.5 million active brokerage accounts. More than 80% of our bank deposits qualified for FDIC insurance as of December 31, 2024. Our clients' allocation of cash held on our balance sheet as bank deposits or payables to brokerage clients is sensitive to interest rate levels, with clients typically increasing their utilization of investment cash solutions, such as purchased money market funds and certain fixed income products when those yields are higher than those of cash sweep features.\n\nAs a participant in the financial services industry, Schwab relies on access to ex ternal financing in the normal course of business. Schwab's use of external debt facilities may arise from timing differences between cash flow requirements, such as client cash outflows, cash flows from operations, payments on interest-earning assets, movements of cash to meet regulatory brokerage client cash segregation requirements, and general corporate purposes. Rollover risk is the risk that we will not be able to refinance or payoff borrowings as they mature. We maintain policies and procedures necessary to access funding, and test",

      "question": "How has the filing status of the Mandatory Clawback Policy evolved between the 2023 and 2024 SEC 10-K disclosures for Wells Fargo & Company?",
      "answer": "In 2023, the Mandatory Clawback Policy was filed directly as part of the 10-K filing under Exhibit 97. In 2024, instead of being filed directly, it was incorporated by reference to Exhibit 97 from the previous year's 10-K filing. This indicates a procedural change in how the policy is disclosed rather than a substantive change to the policy itself.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2023, the Mandatory Clawback Policy was listed in Exhibit 97 and explicitly stated as 'Filed herewith.'",
        "In 2024, the same policy under Exhibit 97 was not filed anew but instead referenced the prior year's filing with the phrase 'Incorporated by reference to Exhibit 97 to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.'",
        "The shift from direct filing to incorporation by reference represents a procedural evolution in disclosure practice, suggesting the policy remained in effect without needing re-filing."

      "question": "How has the status and availability of shares under the Norwest Corporation Directors' Formula Stock Award Plan evolved between 2023 and 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, the Norwest Corporation Directors' Formula Stock Award Plan was described as a plan under which shares of common stock were awarded to non-employee directors, with the ability to defer receipt of awards until a future year. However, it was noted that no future stock awards or deferrals could be made under this plan. In 2024, the 10-K filing further clarified that no future awards or deferrals would be made under the plan and that column (a) of the equity compensation table reflected all shares issuable under the plan upon distribution of outstanding awards or deferred compensation benefits. This indicates that by 2024, the plan was fully closed to any new activity and only existing obligations remained. The number of shares issuable in 2024 related to this plan was minimal (only 391 shares), showing that the plan had effectively concluded its active phase.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, the plan was described as allowing deferral of awards but explicitly stated that no future awards or deferrals were permitted.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the filing clarified that the plan had no future availability and only reflected outstanding obligations, with only 391 shares remaining issuable.",
        "Step 3: The evolution shows a transition from a closed plan with deferral options to a finalized state where only minimal distributions remained."

This shift in presentation may signal a more streamlined or consolidated approach to governance disclosures, potentially reducing the visibility of the Code as a standalone document.

      "question": "How has the framing of reputational risk related to adverse publicity evolved between 2022 and 2024 in BK's risk disclosures, particularly in terms of associated impacts or linked concerns?",
      "answer": "In 2022, BK identified adverse publicity as a risk that could negatively affect its business, financial condition, and results of operations, and linked it with government scrutiny and other reputational harm. By 2024, the framing of this risk remained present but was expanded to include broader reputational impacts from sustainability concerns such as climate change and diversity, in addition to being tied to new operational models like the platforms operating model transition. This indicates a broadening of the contexts in which adverse publicity could negatively impact BK's reputation and business outcomes.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, BK explicitly stated that adverse events, publicity, government scrutiny, or reputational harm could negatively affect its business.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, BK retained the mention of adverse publicity and reputational harm but added new dimensions such as sustainability concerns (climate change and diversity) and the transition to a platforms operating model.",
        "Step 3: The evolution reflects a transformation in how BK characterizes the risk of adverse publicity, expanding beyond traditional reputational threats to include systemic and strategic transformational risks."

LLC Executive Life Insurance Policy and Certificate with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (Exhibit 10.11) and a form of the policy with Pacific Life & Annuity Company (Exhibit 10.12). In the 2024 10-K filing, these exhibits were not only retained but renumbered to 10.12 and 10.13 respectively, indicating a reorganization of exhibit numbering. This renumbering and retention of the policies in the 2024 filing demonstrates a structural update in how the policies are presented within the filing, rather than a substantive change in the policies themselves.",

      "question": "How has Goldman Sachs' disclosure and positioning of the Restricted Partner Compensation Plan evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in relation to newer compensation governance policies introduced during this period?",
      "answer": "In 2023, the Restricted Partner Compensation Plan was listed as Exhibit 10.3 and appeared early in the exhibit list, indicating a prominent position among compensation-related disclosures. By 2024, while the plan itself (still referenced as Exhibit 10.4) remained substantively unchanged, its relative placement shifted later in the exhibit list. Notably, in 2024, the firm introduced the Clawback Policy (Exhibit 10.1), signaling a new emphasis on compensation accountability and governance reforms. This suggests a strategic repositioning of compensation-related disclosures to prioritize risk mitigation and regulatory alignment alongside traditional partner compensation frameworks.",

        "Step 1: Identify the position and treatment of the Restricted Partner Compensation Plan in the 2023 filing (Exhibit 10.3, listed early among key compensation plans).",
        "Step 2: Identify how the same plan is treated in the 2024 filing (now Exhibit 10.4, moved to a later position) and note the introduction of new compensation-related disclosures like the Clawback Policy (Exhibit 10.1).",
        "Step 3: Analyze the implications of the plan's reordering and the addition of new governance-oriented exhibits, indicating a shift in emphasis toward accountability and regulatory responsiveness in compensation practices."

      "question": "How did BNY Mellon's disclosure approach to the Directors' Code of Conduct evolve between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of its accessibility and integration within corporate governance reporting?",
      "answer": "In 2022, BNY Mellon explicitly stated that the Directors' Code of Conduct was posted on its website and outlined its applicability to all directors. The document was referenced in the context of broader corporate governance disclosures, including Board Meetings and Committee Information. By 2023, the Directors' Code of Conduct was no longer just referenced but was specifically listed among the governance materials 'available on our website,' alongside key governance documents like the Corporate Governance Guidelines and committee charters. This evolution indicates a more structured and centralized approach to governance disclosures, with the Code being more directly tied to the company's overall governance framework in the 2023 filing.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, the Directors' Code of Conduct was mentioned as being posted on the website and applied to all directors, embedded within a broader section on corporate governance and board information.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the Code was explicitly listed among key governance materials available on the website, indicating a more deliberate emphasis on its accessibility and integration into governance reporting.",
        "Step 3: The shift from a general reference in 2022 to a more prominent listing in 2023 reflects a strategic change in how BNY Mellon presents its governance framework, enhancing transparency and accessibility of the Directors' Code of Conduct."

Our purpose is to uplift everyone, everywhere by being the best way to pay and be paid. We facilitate global commerce and money movement across more than 200 countries and territories  among  a  global  set  of  consumers,  merchants,  financial  institutions  and  government  entities  through innovative technologies.\n\nSince Visa's early days in 1958, we have been in the business of facilitating payments between consumers and businesses. As a trusted engine of commerce and with new ways to pay, we are working to provide payment solutions for everyone, everywhere. We are focused on extending, enhancing and investing in our proprietary network, VisaNet, to offer a single connection point for facilitating payment transactions to multiple endpoints through various form factors. Through  our  network,  we  offer  products,  solutions  and  services  that  facilitate  secure,  reliable  and  efficient  money movement for participants in the ecosystem.\n\n- We facilitate secure, reliable and efficient money movement among consumers, issuing and acquiring financial institutions, and merchants. We have traditionally referred to this as the 'four-party' model. Please see Our  Core  Business discussion  below.  As  the  payments  ecosystem  continues  to  evolve,  we  have broadened this model to include digital banks, digital wallets and a range of financial technology companies (fintechs),  governments  and  non-governmental  organizations  (NGOs).  We  provide  transaction  processing services  (primarily  authorization,  clearing  and  settlement)  to  our  financial  institution  and  merchant  clients through VisaNet, our advanced transaction processing network. During fiscal year 2022, we saw 258 billion payments and cash transactions with Visa's brand, equating to an average of 707 million transactions per day. Of the 258 billion total transactions, 193 billion were processed by Visa.\n- We offer a wide range of Visa-branded payment products that our clients, including nearly 15,000 financial institutions, use to develop and offer core business solutions, including credit, debit, prepaid and cash access programs  for  individual,  business  and  government  account  holders.  During  fiscal  year  2022,  Visa's  total payments and cash volume was $14 trillion, and 4.1 billion credentials were available worldwide to be used at more than 80 million merchant locations, plus an estimated 20 million locations through payment facilitators. (1) (1)\n- We take an open partnership approach and seek to provide value by enabling access to our global network, including  offering  our  technology  capabilities  through  application  programming  interfaces  (APIs).  We  partner with both traditional and emerging players to innovate and expand the payments ecosystem, allowing them to leverage the resources of our platform to scale and grow their businesses more quickly and effectively.\n- We are accelerating the migration to digital payments and continue to evolve to be a 'network of networks' to enable the movement of money through all available networks. We aim to provide a single connection point so that Visa clients can enable money movement for businesses, governments and consumers, regardless of which network is used to start or complete the transaction. This ultimately helps to unify a complex payments ecosystem. Visa's network of networks approach creates opportunities by facilitating person-to-person (P2P), business-to-consumer (B2C), business-to-business (B2B), business-to-small business (B2b) and governmentto-consumer (G2C) payments, in addition to consumer to business (C2B) payments.\n- We provide value added services to  our clients, including issuing solutions, acceptance solutions, risk and identity solutions, open banking and advisory services.\n- We  invest  in  and  promote  our  brand to  the  benefit  of  our  clients  and  partners  through  advertising, promotional  and  sponsorship  initiatives  with  FIFA,  the  International  Olympic  Committee,  the  International Paralympic Committee and the National Football League (NFL), among others. We also use these sponsorship assets to showcase our payment innovations.\n\nData provided to Visa by acquiring institutions and other third parties as of June 30, 2022. (1)\n\n## PART I",

They can also connect with other fintechs through a global payment management platform to use their serv ices. Using an omnichannel solution with a cloud-based architecture, Visa Acceptance Solutions capabilities, which includes Cybersource and Authorize.net, prov ide new and enhanced payment integrations with ecommerce platforms, enabling sellers and acquirers to prov ide tailored commerce experiences with payments seamlessly embedded.\n\nIn  addition,  Visa Acceptance  Solutions  prov ide  secure,  reliable  serv ices  for  merchants  and  acquirers  that  reduce  friction  and  driv e  acceptance.

Visa's protection from the plan is further limited to 70% of any liabilities where the claim relates to inter-regional multilateral interchange fee rates where the issuer is located outside the Visa Europe territory, and the merchant is located within the Visa Europe territory. The plan does not  protect  the  Company  in  Europe  against  all  types  of  litigation  or  remedies  or  fines  imposed  in  competition  law enforcement proceedings, only the interchange litigation specifically covered by the plan's terms.\n\nUnlike  the  U.S.  retrospective  responsibility  plan,  the  Europe  retrospective  responsibility  plan  does  not  have  an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through a periodic adjustment to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred  stock.  The  total  amount  of  protection  available  through  the  preferred  stock  component  of  the  Europe retrospective responsibility plan is equivalent to the as-converted value of the preferred stock, which can be calculated at  any  point  in  time  as  the  product  of:  (a)  the  outstanding  number  of  shares  of  preferred  stock;  (b)  the  current conversion rate applicable to each class of preferred stock; and (c) Visa's class A common stock price. This amount differs  from  the  value  of  the  preferred  stock  recorded  within  stockholders'  equity  on  the  Company's  consolidated balance  sheets.  The  book  value  of  the  preferred  stock  reflects  its  historical  value  recorded  at  the  Closing  less  VE territory  covered  losses  recovered  through  a  reduction  of  the  applicable  conversion  rate.  The  book  value  does  not reflect changes in the underlying class A common stock price subsequent to the Closing.\n\nVisa  Inc.  net  income  is  not  impacted  by  VE  territory  covered  losses  as  long  as  the  as-converted  value  of  the preferred stock is greater than the covered loss. VE territory covered losses are recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable, or in the case of attorney's fees, when incurred. Concurrently, the Company records  a  reduction  to  stockholders'  equity,  which  represents  the  Company's  right  to  recover  such  losses  through adjustments to the conversion rate applicable to the preferred stock. The reduction to stockholders' equity is recorded in a contra-equity account referred to as 'right to recover for covered losses.'\n\nVE territory covered losses may be recorded before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conversion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, individual loss greater than \u20ac20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conversion rate is made, the amount previously recorded in 'right to recover for covered losses' as contra-equity is then recorded against the book value of the preferred stock within stockholders' equity.\n\nAs  required  by  the  litigation  management  deed,  on  June  21,  2022,  the  sixth  anniversary  of  the  Visa  Europe acquisition,  Visa,  in  consultation  with  the  VE  Territory  Litigation  Management  Committee,  carried  out  a  release assessment. After the completion of this assessment, the Company released $3.5 billion of the as-converted value from its  series  B  and  C  preferred  stock  and  issued  176,655  shares  of  series A  preferred  stock  on  July  29,  2022  (Sixth Anniversary  Release).  Each  holder  of  a  share  of  series  B  and  C  preferred  stock  received  a  number  of  series  A preferred stock equal to the applicable conversion adjustment divided by 100. The Company paid $3 million in cash in lieu of issuing fractional shares of series A preferred stock. Each share of series A preferred stock will be automatically converted  into  100  shares  of  class A  common  stock  in  connection  with  a  sale  to  a  person  eligible  to  hold  class A common stock in accordance with Visa's certificate of incorporation.

T he  Company has entered into a litigation management deed with  Visa  Europe which sets forth the agreed upon procedures for the management of the VE territory cov ered litigation, the allocation of losses resulting from this litigation (VE territory cov ered losses) between the series B and C preferred stock, and any accelerated conv ersion or reduction in the conv ersion rate of the shares of series B and C preferred stock. The litigation management deed applies only to VE territory cov ered litigation (and resultant losses and liabilities). T he litigation management deed provides  that  the  Company  will  generally  control  the  conduct  of  the  VE  territory  cov ered  litigation,  subject  to  certain  obligations  to  report  and consult with the litigation management committee for VE territory cov ered litigation (VE T erritory Litigation Management Committee). The VE T erritory Litigation  Management Committee, which is composed of representativ es of certain Visa Europe members, has also been granted consent rights to approve certain material decisions in relation to the VE territory cov ered litigation.\n\nThe  Company  obtained  certain  protections  for  VE  territory  cov ered  losses  through  the  series  B  and  C  preferred  stock,  the  UK  loss  sharing agreement and the litigation management deed (collectiv ely Europe retrospectiv e responsibility plan).

The Company is entitled to recov er VE territory cov ered losses through periodic adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. The total amount of protection av ailable through the preferred stock component of the Europe retrospectiv e responsibility plan is equiv alent to the as-conv erted v alue of the preferred stock, which can be calculated at any point in time as the product of: (a) the outstanding number of shares of preferred stock; (b) the current conv ersion rate applicable to each series of preferred stock; and (c) Visa's class A common stock price. This amount differs from the v alue of the preferred stock recorded within stockholders' equity on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The book v alue of the preferred stock reflects its historical v alue recorded at the Closing less VE territory cov ered losses recovered through a reduction of the applicable conv ersion rate. T he book v alue does not reflect changes in the underlying class A common stock price subsequent to the Closing.\n\nVisa Inc. net income is not impacted by VE territory cov ered losses as long as the as-conv erted v alue of the preferred stock is greater than the covered loss. VE territory cov ered losses are recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable, or in the case of attorney's fees, when incurred. Concurrently, the Company records a reduction to stockholders' equity in the contra-equity account right to recov er for cov ered losses, which represents the Company's right to recov er such losses through adjustments to the conv ersion rate applicable to the preferred stock.\n\nVE territory cov ered losses may be recorded before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conv ersion rate is effected.

After the completion of this assessment, the Company released $2.7 billion of the as-conv erted v alue from its series B and C preferred stock and issued 99,264 shares of series A preferred stock in July 2024 (Eighth Anniversary Release). Each holder of a share of series B and C preferred stock receiv ed a number of series A preferred stock equal to the applicable conversion adjustment div ided by 100. The Company paid $5 million in cash in lieu of issuing fractional shares of series A preferred stock. Each share of series A preferred stock will be automatically conv erted into 100 shares of class A common stock in connection with a sale to a person eligible to hold class A common stock in accordance with Visa's certificate of incorporation.",

With respect to our class B and C common stock, these transactions include a proposed consolidation or merger, a decision to exit our core payments business and any other vote required under Delaware law.

Because the holders of classes of capital stock other than class A common stock are our current and former financial institution clients, they may have interests that diverge from our class A common stockholders.

      "answer": "In 2022, Visa's U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan was described as a mechanism to address monetary liabilities from settlements or final judgments in U.S. covered litigation, utilizing a U.S. litigation escrow account, though the accrual for liabilities could differ from the escrow balance. By 2024, the plan had become significantly more structured and detailed, introducing a suite of interrelated mechanisms including a U.S. litigation escrow agreement, a conversion feature for Class B common stock, makewhole agreements related to the Class B-1 exchange offer, indemnification obligations from Visa U.S.A. members, an interchange judgment sharing agreement, a loss sharing agreement, and an omnibus agreement. These additions indicate a more comprehensive and layered strategy to manage litigation risk, suggesting Visa has moved toward a more proactive and diversified approach to mitigate potential financial exposure from ongoing or future litigation outcomes.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, the U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan was primarily described as a liability management tool tied to the U.S. litigation escrow account with recognition of potential mismatches between accruals and escrow balances.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the plan was expanded to include multiple interlocking mechanisms involving stock features, indemnifications, and shared liability agreements, indicating a more robust risk-sharing framework.",
        "Step 3: The evolution from a basic escrow-based model to a multifaceted structure reflects a strategic shift toward more sophisticated risk mitigation and broader distribution of litigation-related financial exposure."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Revenue Recognition -Client Incentives\n\nCritical estimates. We enter into long-term incentive agreements with financial institution clients, merchants and other business partners for various programs that provide cash and other incentives designed to increase revenue by growing  payments  volume,  increasing  Visa  product  acceptance,  winning  merchant  routing  transactions  over  to  our network and driving innovation. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to net revenues; however, if a  separate  identifiable  benefit  at  fair  value  can  be  established,  they  are  accounted  for  as  operating  expenses. Incentives are recognized systematically and rationally based on management's estimate of each client's performance. These estimates are regularly reviewed and adjusted as appropriate based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.\n\nAssumptions  and  judgment. Estimation  of  client  incentives  relies  on  forecasts  of  payments  and  transaction volume, card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using client-reported information, transactional information  accumulated  from  our  systems,  historical  information,  market  and  economic  conditions  and  discussions with our clients, merchants and business partners.\n\nImpact if actual results differ from assumptions. If actual performance is not consistent with our estimates, client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume, which drive our net revenues. As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed  estimates,  such  payments  are  not  expected  to  have  a  material  effect  on  our  financial  condition,  results  of operations or cash flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. For the year ended September 30, 2022, client incentives represented 26% of gross revenues.\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Matters\n\nCritical estimates. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete  control  and  may  not  be  known  for  prolonged  periods  of  time.  Management  is  required  to  assess  the probability of loss and estimate the amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our consolidated financial statements.\n\nAssumptions and judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether a loss is  reasonably  estimable.  Our  judgments  are  subjective  and  based  on  a  number  of  factors,  including  management's understanding of the legal or regulatory profile and the specifics of each proceeding, our history with similar matters, advice  of  internal  and  external  legal  counsel  and  management's  best  estimate  of  incurred  loss.  As  additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential loss related to pending claims and may revise our estimates.\n\nWe have entered into loss sharing agreements that reduce our potential liability under certain litigation. However, our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation. The plan's mechanisms include the use of the U.S. litigation escrow account. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account balance. Our Europe retrospective responsibility plan only covers Visa Europe territory covered litigation (and resultant liabilities and losses)  relating  to  the  covered  period,  subject  to  certain  limitations,  and  does  not  cover  any  fines  or  penalties incurred in the European Commission proceedings or any other matter. See Note 5-U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20-Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data .\n\nImpact  if  actual  results  differ  from  assumptions. Due  to  the  inherent  uncertainties  of  the  legal  and  regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations in the  period  in  which  the  effect  becomes  probable  and  reasonably  estimable.  See Note  20-Legal  Matters to  our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data .\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nCritical estimates.

          "chunk_text": "We also establish an allowance for loans and interest receivable, which represents our estimate of current expected credit losses inherent in our portfolio of loans and interest receivable. This evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments. The allowance is primarily based on expectations of credit losses based on historical lifetime loss data as well as macroeconomic forecasts applied to the portfolio, which is segmented by factors such as geographic region, delinquency, and vintage. Loss curves are generated using historical loss data for each loan portfolio and are applied to segments of each portfolio, categorized by factors such as geographic region, first borrowing versus repeat borrowing, delinquency, credit rating and vintage, which vary by portfolio. We then apply macroeconomic factors such as forecasted  trends  in  unemployment  and  benchmark  credit  card  charge-off  rates, which are sourced externally, using a single scenario that we believe is most appropriate to the economic conditions applicable to a particular period. We utilize externally sourced macroeconomic scenario data to supplement our historical information due to the limited period in which our credit product offerings have been in existence. Projected loss rates, inclusive of historical loss data and macroeconomic factors, are applied to the principal amount of our consumer and merchant receivables. We also include qualitative adjustments  that  incorporate  incremental  information  not  captured  in  the  quantitative  estimates  of  our  current  expected  credit losses. Our consumer receivables consist of revolving products, which do not have a contractual term, and installment products. The reasonable and supportable forecast period for revolving products, installment products, and merchant products that we have included in our projected loss rates, which approximates the estimated life of the loans, is approximately 2 years, approximately 7 months to 2.5 years, and approximately 2.5 to 3.5 years, respectively. In 2020, the reasonable and supportable forecast period for revolving consumer products was based only on externally sourced data due to the lack of availability of historical data, and in 2021, it was updated to reflect historical loss experience with the portfolio. The allowance for current expected credit losses on interest and fees receivable is determined primarily by applying loss curves to each portfolio by geography, delinquency, and period of origination, among other factors.\n\nDetermining appropriate current expected credit loss allowances for loans and interest receivable is an inherently uncertain process and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates. We regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and  events  occur  that  may  impact  the  settlement  or  recovery  of  losses.  The  allowances  are  maintained  at  a  level  we  deem appropriate  to  adequately  provide  for  current  expected  credit  losses  at  the  balance  sheet  date  after  incorporating  the  impact  of externally sourced macroeconomic forecasts. These forecasts project scenarios such as future unemployment and benchmark credit card  charge-off  rates. As  of  December  31,  2021,  we  utilized  externally  published  projections  of  the  U.S.  and  U.K.  forecasted unemployment  rates  over  the  reasonable  and  supportable  forecast  period.  As  of  December  31,  2020,  we  utilized  externally published  projections  of  the  U.S.  forecasted  credit  card  charge-off  rates  and  U.K  forecasted  unemployment  rates  over  the reasonable and supportable forecast period. The overall principal and interest coverage ratio as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was  approximately  9%  and  23%,  respectively. A  significant  change  in  the  forecasted  macroeconomic  factors  could  result  in  a material change in our allowances. Our allowance as of December 31, 2021 took into account continued volatility with respect to macroeconomic conditions and uncertainty around the financial health of our merchant borrowers, including uncertainty around the effectiveness  of  loan  modification  programs  made  available  to  merchants.  Our  allowance  as  of  December  31,  2020  took  into account for the proactive and reactive measures that we took to help reduce financial difficulties experienced by our customers, limitations  in  our  expected  credit  loss  models  that  arose  due  to  the  extreme  fluctuations  in  both  the  actual  and  forecasted macroeconomic conditions in the period, varying degrees of merchant performance in the current environment as well as expected future performance, and to account for payment holidays granted. We are unable to predict the ultimate impact of these actions which may result in adjustments to our allowance for loans and interest receivable in future periods. An increase of 1% in the principal and interest coverage ratio would increase our allowances by approximately $53 million based on the loans and interest receivable balance outstanding as of December 31, 2021.\n\n## ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES\n\nOur  annual  tax  rate  is  based  on  our  income,  statutory  tax  rates,  and  tax  planning  opportunities  available  to  us  in  the  various jurisdictions  in  which  we  operate. Tax  laws  are  complex  and  subject  to  different  interpretations  by  the  taxpayer  and  respective government taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including  evaluating  uncertainties.  We  review  our  tax  positions  quarterly  and  adjust  the  balances  as  new  information  becomes available.  Our  income  tax  rate  is  significantly  affected  by  the  tax  rates  that  apply  to  our  foreign  earnings.  In  addition  to  local country tax laws and regulations, our income tax rate depends on the extent that our foreign earnings are taxed by the U.S. through provisions such as the GILTI tax and base erosion anti-abuse tax or as a result of our indefinite reinvestment assertion. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment about, and intentions concerning, our future operations.",

We purchase receivables related to credit extended to U.S. merchants by a partner institution and are responsible for the servicing functions  related  to  that  portfolio.  During  the  years  ended  December  31,  2024  and  2023,  we  purchased  approx imately  $1.8  billion  and  $1.7  billion  in  merchant receivables, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total outstanding balance in our pool of merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable was $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, net of the participation interest sold to the partner institution of $53 million and $44 million, respectively. See 'Note 1Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies' for additional information on this participation arrangement.\n\nThrough our PPWC product, merchants can borrow a certain percentage of their annual payment volume processed by PayPal and are charged a fixed fee for the loan or advance based on the overall credit assessment of the merchant. Loans and advances are repaid through a fixed percentage of the merchant's future payment volume that PayPal processes. Through our PPBL product, we provide merchants access to short-term business financing for a fixed fee based on an evaluation of the applying business as well as the business owner. PPBL repayments are collected through periodic payments until the balance has been satisfied.\n\nThe interest or fee is fix ed at the time the loan or advance is ex tended and is recognized as deferred revenue in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The fixed interest or fee is amortized into revenues from other value added services based on the amount repaid over the repayment period. We estimate the repayment period for PPWC based on the merchant's payment processing history with PayPal. For PPWC, there is a general requirement that at least 10% of the original amount of the loan or advance plus the fixed fee must be repaid every 90 days. We calculate the repayment rate of the merchant's future payment volume so that repayment of the loan or advance and fixed fee is expected to generally occur within 9 to 12 months from the date of the loan or advance. On a monthly basis, we recalculate the repayment period based on the repayment activity on the receivable. As such, actual repayment periods are dependent on actual merchant payment processing volumes. For PPBL, we receive fixed periodic payments over the contractual term of the loan, which generally ranges from 3  to 12 months.\n\n101",

These cash inflows were partially offset by repayment of outstanding borrowings under our Credit Agreement of $3.0 billion, the repurchase of $1.6 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, and tax withholdings related to net share settlement of equity awards of $521 million.\n\n## Effect of exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n\nForeign  currency  exchange  rates  had  a  negative  impact  of  $102  million  and  a  positive  impact  of  $169  million  on  cash,  cash equivalents,  and  restricted  cash  during  2021  and  2020,  respectively.  The  negative  and  positive  impacts  in  2021  and  2020, respectively,  resulted  primarily  from  fluctuations  in  the  exchange  rate  of  the  U.S.  dollar  to  the Australian  dollar.  The  negative impact in 2021 included, to a lesser extent, the unfavorable impact of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the Euro and Swedish krona.\n\n## Available credit and debt\n\nIn September 2019, we entered into a credit agreement (the 'Credit Agreement') that provides for an unsecured $5.0 billion, fiveyear revolving credit facility that includes a $150 million letter of credit sub-facility and a $500 million swingline sub-facility, with available borrowings under the revolving credit facility reduced by the amount of any letters of credit and swingline borrowings outstanding from time to time. As of December 31, 2021, no borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Agreement and as such, $5.0  billion  of  borrowing  capacity  was  available  for  the  purposes  permitted  by  the  Credit  Agreement,  subject  to  customary conditions to borrowing.\n\nIn  October  2021,  we  assumed  a  credit  agreement  through  our  acquisition  of  Paidy  (the  'Paidy  Credit Agreement'). The  Paidy Credit Agreement  provides  for  a  secured  revolving  credit  facility  of  approximately  $198  million.  Borrowings  under  the  Paidy Credit Agreement must be used to fund the origination of loan receivables. As of December 31, 2021, approximately $98 million was outstanding under the Paidy Credit Agreement. Accordingly, at December 31, 2021, approximately $100 million of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the Paidy Credit Agreement, subject to customary conditions to borrowing.\n\nWe maintain uncommitted credit facilities in various regions throughout the world with a borrowing capacity of approximately $90 million  in  the  aggregate,  where  we  can  withdraw  and  utilize  the  funds  at  our  discretion  for  general  corporate  purposes. As  of December  31,  2021,  the  majority  of  the  borrowing  capacity  under  these  credit  facilities  was  available,  subject  to  customary conditions to borrowing.\n\nIn May 2020 and September 2019, we issued fixed rate notes with varying maturity dates for an aggregate principal amount of $9.0 billion  (collectively  referred  to  as  the  'Notes').  Proceeds  from  the  issuance  of  these  Notes  may  be  used  for  general  corporate purposes, which may include funding the repayment or redemption of outstanding debt, share repurchases, ongoing operations, capital expenditures, and possible acquisitions of businesses, assets, or strategic investments. As of December 31, 2021, we had $9.0 billion in fixed rate debt outstanding with varying maturity dates.\n\nFor additional information, see 'Note 12-Debt' to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\n\nDepending  on  market  conditions,  we  may  from  time  to  time  issue  debt,  including  in  private  or  public  offerings,  to  fund  our operating activities,  finance  acquisitions,  make  strategic  investments,  repurchase  shares  under  our  stock  repurchase  program,  or reduce our cost of capital.\n\nWe have a cash pooling arrangement with a financial institution for cash management purposes. The arrangement allows for cash withdrawals from the financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the financial institution ('Aggregate Cash Deposits'). The arrangement also allows us to withdraw amounts exceeding the Aggregate Cash Deposits up to an agreed-upon limit. The net balance of the withdrawals and the Aggregate Cash Deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expense or income under the arrangement. As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of $3.5 billion in cash withdrawals offsetting our $3.5 billion in Aggregate Cash Deposits held within the financial institution under the cash pooling arrangement.",

The Credit Agreement includes a $150 million letter of credit sub-facility and a $600 million swingline sub-facility, with available borrowings under the revolving credit facility reduced by the amount of any letters of credit and swingline borrowings outstanding from time to time. Loans borrowed under the Credit Agreement are available in U.S. dollar, Euro, British pound, and Australian dollar, and in each case subject to the sub-limits and other limitations provided in the Credit Agreement. We may also, subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders and satisfaction of specified conditions, increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to $2.0 billion.  Subject  to  specific  conditions, we may designate one or more of our subsidiaries as additional borrowers under the  Credit Agreement, provided  PayPal Holdings, Inc. guarantees the portion of borrowings made available and other obligations of any such subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2024,  certain  subsidiaries  were  designated  as  additional  borrowers.  Funds  borrowed  under  the  Credit  Agreement  may  be  used  for  working  capital,  capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other purposes not in contravention of the Credit Agreement.\n\nWe are obligated to pay interest on loans under the Credit Agreement and other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type, including an upfront fee and an unused commitment fee based on our debt rating. Loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at either (i) the applicable term benchmark rate plus a margin (based  on  the  Company's  public  debt  ratings)  ranging  from 0.750%  to 1.250%,  (ii)  the  applicable  Risk-Free  Rate  (Sterling  Overnight  Index  Average  for  loans denominated in pounds sterling and Euro Short-Term Rate for loans denominated in euros) rate plus a margin (based on the Company's public debt ratings) ranging from 0.750% to 1.250%, (iii) the applicable overnight rate plus a margin (based on the Company's public debt ratings) ranging from 0.750% to 1.250% or (iv) a formula based on the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate or the adjusted term Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus a margin (based on the Company's public debt ratings)  ranging  from zero  to 0.250%.  Subject to certain conditions stated in the  Credit Agreement, the  Company and any subsidiaries designated as additional borrowers may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under the revolving credit facility at any time during the term of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on June 7, 2028, unless (a) the commitments are terminated earlier, either at the request of the Company or, if an event of default occurs, by the lenders (or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcy-related events), or (b) the maturity date is ex tended upon the request of the Company, subject to the agreement of the lenders. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant, events of default, and indemnification provisions in favor of the lenders. The negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and the incurrence of subsidiary indebtedness, in each case subject to certain exceptions. The financial covenant requires the Company to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to a maximum consolidated leverage ratio.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, no borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Accordingly, at December 31, 2024, $ 5.0 billion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the Credit Agreement, subject to customary conditions to borrowing.\n\n## Paidy credit agreement\n\nIn February 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the 'Paidy Credit Agreement') with Paidy as co-borrower, which provided for an unsecured revolving credit facility of \u00a560.0 billion, which was modified in September 2022, to increase the borrowing capacity by \u00a530.0 billion for a total borrowing capacity of \u00a590.0 billion (approximately $574 million as of December 31, 2024). Borrowings under the Paidy Credit Agreement are for use by Paidy for working capital, capital expenditures, and other permitted purposes. Loans under the Paidy Credit Agreement bear interest at the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin (based on our public debt rating) ranging  from 0.40%  to 0.60%.

The negative impact in 2024 was primarily due to unfavorable fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the Australian dollar and, to a lesser extent, the British pound and Euro. The positive impact in 2023 was primarily due to favorable fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the British pound.\n\n## Available credit and debt\n\nIn June 2023, we entered into a credit agreement (the 'Credit Agreement') that provides for an unsecured $5.0 billion, five-year revolving credit facility. The Credit Agreement includes a $150 million letter of credit sub-facility and a $600 million swingline sub-facility, with available borrowings under the revolving credit facility reduced by the amount of any letters of credit and swingline borrowings outstanding from time to time. As of December 31, 2024, no borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Agreement and as such, $5.0 billion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the Credit Agreement, subject to customary conditions to borrowing.\n\nIn February 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the 'Paidy Credit Agreement') with Paidy as co-borrower, which provided for an unsecured revolving credit facility of \u00a560.0 billion, which was modified in September 2022 to increase the borrowing capacity by \u00a530.0 billion for a total borrowing capacity of \u00a590.0 billion (approximately $574 million as of December 31, 2024). In the year ended December 31, 2024, \u00a590.0 billion (approximately $574 million) was drawn down under the Paidy Credit Agreement. Accordingly, at December 31, 2024, no borrowing capacity was available under the Paidy Credit Agreement.\n\nWe maintain uncommitted credit facilities in various regions throughout the world with a borrowing capacity of approximately $80 million in the aggregate, where we can withdraw and utilize the funds at our discretion for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2024, substantially all of the borrowing capacity under these credit facilities was available, subject to customary conditions to borrowing.\n\nIn May 2024, June 2023, May 2022, May 2020 and September 2019, we issued fixed rate notes with varying maturity dates (collectively referred to as the 'Notes'). Proceeds from the issuance of these Notes may be used for general corporate purposes, which may include funding the repayment or redemption of outstanding debt, share repurchases, ongoing operations, capital expenditures, and possible acquisitions of businesses, assets, or strategic investments.

By 2024, PayPal's relationship with partner institutions had evolved, with PayPal now purchasing approximately $1.8 billion in merchant receivables in 2024 (up from $1.7 billion in 2023), and the total outstanding balance in the pool of merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable reached $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2024 (up from $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2023).

If any impairment is identified for non-marketable equity securities or impairment is considered other-than-temporary for our equity method investments (and prior to January 1, 2020, available-for-sale debt securities), we write down the investment to its fair value and record the corresponding charge through other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements  of  income.  Prior  to  January  1,  2020,  this  assessment  with  respect  to  our  available-for-sale  debt  securities  took  into account the severity and duration of the decline in value, our intent to sell the security, whether it was more likely than not we would be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, and whether we expected to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security (that is, whether a credit loss existed). Beginning January 1, 2020, our available-for-sale debt securities  in  an  unrealized  loss  position  are  written  down  to  fair  value  through  a  charge  to  other  income  (expense),  net  in  our consolidated statements of income if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security  before  recovery  of  its  amortized  cost  basis.  For  the  remaining  available-for-sale  debt  securities  in  an  unrealized  loss position, if we identify that the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses, taking into consideration changes to the rating of the security by rating agencies, implied yields versus benchmark yields, and the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, among other factors, we estimate the present value of cash flows expected to be collected. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any portion of impairment not related to credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Loans and interest receivable, net\n\nLoans and interest receivable, net represents merchant receivables originated under our PayPal Working Capital ('PPWC') product and  PayPal  Business  Loan  ('PPBL')  product  and  consumer  loans  originated  under  our  PayPal  Credit  and  installment  credit products. PayPal Credit consists of revolving credit products.\n\nIn the U.S., PPWC and PPBL products are provided under a program agreement we have with WebBank, an independent chartered financial  institution.  WebBank  extends  credit  to  merchants  for  the  PPWC  and  PPBL  products  and  we  are  able  to  purchase  the related  receivables  originated  by  WebBank.  For  our  merchant  finance  products  outside  the  U.S.,  we  extend  working  capital advances  and  loans  in  Europe  through  our  Luxembourg  banking  subsidiary,  and  working  capital  loans  in Australia  through  an Australian  subsidiary.  In  the  U.S.,  we  extend  installment  loans  to  consumers  through  a  U.S.  subsidiary.  For  our  international consumer credit products, we extend credit in Europe through our Luxembourg banking subsidiary, and in Australia and Japan, through local subsidiaries.\n\nAs part of our arrangement with WebBank in the U.S., we sell back a participation interest in the pool of merchant receivables for the PPWC and PPBL products. WebBank has no recourse against us related to their participation interests for failure of debtors to pay when due. The participation interests held by WebBank have the same priority to the interests held by us and are subject to the same credit, prepayment, and interest rate risk associated with this pool of merchant receivables. All risks of loss are shared pro rata based  on  participation  interests  held  among  all  participating  stakeholders.  We  account  for  the  asset  transfer  as  a  sale  and derecognize the portion of the participation interests for which control has been surrendered. For this arrangement, gains or losses on the sale of the participation interests are not material as the carrying amount of the participation interest sold approximates the fair value at time of transfer.\n\nIn instances where a merchant is able to demonstrate that it is experiencing financial difficulty, there may be a modification of the loans or advances and the related interest receivable for which it is probable that, without modification, we will be unable to collect all amounts due, therefore resulting in a troubled debt restructuring ('TDR'). Refer to 'Note 11-Loans and Interest Receivable' for further information related to TDRs.\n\nLoans, advances, and interest and fees receivable are reported at their outstanding balances, net of any participation interests sold and pro rata current expected credit losses, including unamortized deferred origination costs. We maintain the servicing rights for the entire pool of consumer and merchant receivables outstanding and receive a market-based service fee for servicing the assets underlying the participation interest sold.\n\nWe offer both revolving and installment credit products to our consumers. The terms of our consumer relationships require us to submit  monthly  bills  to  the  consumer  detailing  loan  repayment  requirements.  The  terms  also  allow  us  to  charge  the  consumer interest and fees in certain circumstances. Due to the relatively small dollar amount of individual loans and interest receivable, we do not require collateral on these balances.",

The decrease in allowance for credit losses was related to the improvement in credit quality of interest-bearing installment loans in the U.S. offset by the growth of interest-bearing installment loans in the U.S., revolving loans in the U.K., and installment loans in Japan.\n\n## Merchant receivables\n\nWe offer access to merchant finance products for certain small and medium-sized businesses through our PPWC and PPBL products, which we collectively refer to as our merchant finance offerings. We purchase receivables related to credit extended to U.S. merchants by a partner institution and are responsible for the servicing functions  related  to  that  portfolio.  During  the  years  ended  December  31,  2024  and  2023,  we  purchased  approx imately  $1.8  billion  and  $1.7  billion  in  merchant receivables, respectively.

See 'Note 1Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies' for additional information on this participation arrangement.\n\nThrough our PPWC product, merchants can borrow a certain percentage of their annual payment volume processed by PayPal and are charged a fixed fee for the loan or advance based on the overall credit assessment of the merchant. Loans and advances are repaid through a fixed percentage of the merchant's future payment volume that PayPal processes. Through our PPBL product, we provide merchants access to short-term business financing for a fixed fee based on an evaluation of the applying business as well as the business owner. PPBL repayments are collected through periodic payments until the balance has been satisfied.\n\nThe interest or fee is fix ed at the time the loan or advance is ex tended and is recognized as deferred revenue in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The fixed interest or fee is amortized into revenues from other value added services based on the amount repaid over the repayment period. We estimate the repayment period for PPWC based on the merchant's payment processing history with PayPal. For PPWC, there is a general requirement that at least 10% of the original amount of the loan or advance plus the fixed fee must be repaid every 90 days. We calculate the repayment rate of the merchant's future payment volume so that repayment of the loan or advance and fixed fee is expected to generally occur within 9 to 12 months from the date of the loan or advance. On a monthly basis, we recalculate the repayment period based on the repayment activity on the receivable. As such, actual repayment periods are dependent on actual merchant payment processing volumes. For PPBL, we receive fixed periodic payments over the contractual term of the loan, which generally ranges from 3  to 12 months.\n\n101",

We review the allowance for credit losses quarterly, taking into consideration current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, the composition of the existing loan portfolio, past loss experience, and any other risks inherent in the portfolio to ensure that the allowance for credit losses is maintained at an appropriate level.\n\nPALs are collateralized by marketable securities with liquid markets. Credit lines are over-collateralized and borrowers are required to maintain collateral at specified levels at all times. The required collateral levels are determined based on the type of security pledged. Additionally, collateral market value is monitored on a daily basis and a borrower's credit line may be reduced or collateral may be liquidated if the collateral is in danger of falling below specified levels. As such, the credit loss inherent within this portfolio is limited. Schwab applies the practical expedient based on collateral maintenance provisions in estimating an allowance for credit losses for PALs.\n\nThe methodology to establish an allowance for credit losses for the residential real estate portfolio segment utilizes statistical models that estimate prepayments, defaults, and expected losses for this portfolio segment based on predicted behavior of individual loans within the segment. The methodology also evaluates concentrations in the classes of financing receivables, including loan products within those classes, year of origination, and geographical distribution of collateral.\n\nExpected credit losses are forecast using a loan-level simulation of the delinquency status of the loans over the term of the loans. The simulation starts with the current relevant risk indicators, including the current delinquent status of each loan, the estimated current LTV ratio of each loan, the term and structure of each loan, borrower FICO scores, and current key interest rates including U.S. Treasury, SOFR, and LIBOR rates. The more significant variables in the simulation include delinquency roll rates, loss severity, housing prices, interest rates, and the unemployment rate. Delinquency roll rates (i.e., the rates at which loans transition through delinquency stages and ultimately result in a loss) are estimated from our historical loss experience adjusted for current trends and market information, which includes current and forecasted conditions. Loss severity (i.e., loss given default) estimates are based on our historical loss experience and market trends, both current and forecasted. The loss severity estimate used in the allowance for credit loss methodology for HELOCs is higher than that used in the methodology for First Mortgages. Housing price trends are derived from historical home price indices and econometric forecasts of future home values. Factors affecting the home price index include housing inventory, unemployment, interest rates, and inflation expectations. Interest rate projections are based on the current term structure of interest rates and historical volatilities to project various possible future interest rate paths. The unemployment rate forecast is typically based on the recent consensus of regularly published economic surveys. Linear interpolation is applied to revert to long-term trends after the reasonable and supportable forecast period.\n\nThe methodology described above results in loss factors that are applied to the amortized cost basis of loans, exclusive of accrued interest receivable, to determine the allowance for credit losses for First Mortgages and HELOCs.\n\nManagement also estimates a liability for expected credit losses on the Company's commitments to extend credit related to unused HELOCs and commitments to purchase first mortgages. See Note 15 for additional information on these commitments. The liability is calculated by applying the loss factors described above to the commitments expected to be funded and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The liability for expected credit losses on these commitments and related activity were immaterial for all periods presented.\n\nSchwab considers loan modifications in which it makes an economic concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty to be troubled debt restructurings (TDRs).\n\n## Nonaccrual, nonperforming and impaired loans\n\nFirst Mortgages, HELOCs, PALs, and other loans are placed on nonaccrual status upon becoming 90 days past due as to interest or principal (unless the loans are well-secured and in the process of collection), or when the full timely collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain, including loans to borrowers who have filed for bankruptcy. HELOC loans secured by a second lien are placed on non-accrual status if the associated first lien is 90 days or more delinquent, regardless of the payment status of the HELOC. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the accrued and unpaid interest receivable is reversed and the loan is accounted for on the cash or cost recovery method until qualifying for return to accrual status.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Schwab introduced its Commercial Paper Issuance Program as one of several potential sources of external financing, alongside unsecured bank credit lines and a universal shelf registration, to address liquidity needs during market disruptions. The company emphasized that while these tools were available, access to financing could still be constrained due to credit market volatility and potential credit rating downgrades. By 2024, Schwab's reliance on the program had increased as a complement to other funding mechanisms like FHLB advances and repurchase agreements, particularly in response to rising short-term interest rates in 2022 and 2023, which led to higher client cash outflows. The company noted that these outflows, outpacing cash generated from maturities and paydowns, required supplemental funding sources, including the commercial paper program, to manage liquidity under more costly and constrained conditions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Schwab introduced the Commercial Paper Issuance Program as part of a broader set of external financing tools, acknowledging that market disruptions could limit access to these sources.",
        "Step 2: By 2024, Schwab's financing needs had evolved due to rising interest rates in 2022 and 2023, which triggered significant client movement of cash into higher-yielding alternatives, increasing reliance on the commercial paper program as part of a broader supplemental funding strategy.",
        "Step 3: The evolution reflects a shift from a general contingency plan in 2022 to a more active reliance on the program in 2024 as part of a strategic response to changing market conditions and liquidity pressures."

          "chunk_text": "## THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\nWhen available cash is not sufficient for our liquidity needs, we may seek external financing. During periods of disruptions in the credit and capital markets, potential sources of external financing could be reduced, and borrowing costs could increase. Although CSC, CS&amp;Co, and TDAC maintain uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines and CSC has a commercial paper issuance program, as well as a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC which can be used to sell securities, financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all due to market conditions or disruptions in the credit markets. In addition, a significant downgrade in the Company's credit ratings could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets.\n\n## Credit Risk\n\n## We may suffer significant losses from our credit exposures.\n\nOur businesses are subject to the risk that a client, counterparty or issuer will fail to perform its contractual obligations, or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate. While we have policies and procedures designed to manage this risk, the policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Our exposure mainly results from margin lending, clients' options and futures trading, securities lending, mortgage lending, pledged asset lending, our role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities, and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds we sponsor.\n\nWhen clients purchase securities on margin, borrow on lines of credit collateralized by securities, or trade options or futures, we are subject to the risk that clients may default on their obligations when the value of the securities and cash in their accounts falls below the amount of clients' indebtedness. Abrupt changes in securities valuations and the failure of clients to meet margin calls could result in substantial losses, especially if there is a lack of liquidity. As a result of our TD Ameritrade acquisition, our margin, options and futures business has materially increased and market liquidity may represent an increased risk.\n\nWe have exposure to credit risk associated with our investments. Those investments are subject to price fluctuations. Loss of value of securities can negatively affect earnings if management determines that such loss of value has resulted from a credit loss. The evaluation of whether a credit loss exists is a matter of judgment, which includes the assessment of multiple factors. If management determines that a security's decline in fair value is the result of a credit loss, an allowance for credit losses on the security will be recorded and a corresponding loss will be recognized in current earnings. Even if a decline in fair value of a security is not determined to have resulted from a credit loss, if we were ever forced to sell the security sooner than intended prior to maturity due to liquidity needs, we would have to recognize any unrealized losses at that time.\n\nOur bank loans primarily consist of First Mortgages, HELOCs, and PALs. Increases in delinquency and default rates, housing and stock price declines, increases in the unemployment rate, and other economic factors, including from the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, can result in increases in allowances for credit losses and related credit loss expense, as well as write downs on such loans.\n\nHeightened credit exposures to specific counterparties or instruments can increase our risk of loss. Examples include:\n\n- Large positions in financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or industry;\n- Mortgage loans and HELOCs to banking clients which are secured by properties in the same geographic region; and\n- Client margins, options or futures, pledged assets, and securities lending activities collateralized by or linked to securities of a single issuer, index, or industry.\n\nWe sponsor a number of proprietary money market mutual funds and other proprietary funds. Although we have no obligation to do so, we may decide for competitive or other reasons to provide credit, liquidity or other support to our funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity. Such support could cause us to take significant charges, could reduce our liquidity and, in certain situations, could, with respect to proprietary funds other than money market mutual funds, result in us having to consolidate one or more funds in our financial statements. If we choose not to provide credit, liquidity or other support in such a situation, we could suffer reputational damage and its business could be adversely affected.",

The Company's margin lending activity has significantly increased in recent years, reflecting growth from our acquisition of Ameritrade and market-driven factors.\n\nAs a member firm of securities and derivatives clearing houses, we are required to deposit cash, stock and/or government securities for margin requirements and to clearing funds. The margin requirements may fluctuate significantly from time to time based upon the nature and size of clients' trading activity and market volatility, and member firms like us have been required to deposit additional funds. Clearing houses could also require additional funds from member firms if a clearing member defaults on its obligations to the clearing house in an amount larger than its own margin and clearing fund deposits.\n\nAs a participant in the financial services industry, Schwab relies on access to ex ternal financing in the normal course of business. During periods of disruptions in the credit and capital markets, potential sources of ex ternal financing could be reduced, and borrowing costs could increase. Although CSC and CS&amp;Co maintain multiple sources of external financing including unsecured uncommitted bank credit lines and CSC has a commercial paper issuance program, as well as a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC which can be used to sell securities, financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all due to market conditions or disruptions in the credit markets. In addition, a downgrade in the Company's credit ratings could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets.\n\nWhen short-term interest rates rapidly increase, as they did in 2022 and 2023, client movement of certain cash balances out of our sweep features and into higheryielding alternatives generally increases. When these outflows outpace excess cash on hand and cash generated by maturities and paydowns on our investment and loan portfolios, as they have in recent years, we may need to rely on supplemental funding, such as advances under Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) secured credit facilities, borrowings under repurchase agreements with external financial institutions, issuances of brokered certificates of deposit (CDs), or other sources of funding, which have higher costs and could be subject to limitations on availability. In addition, to access new FHLB advances or roll over existing advances, our banking subsidiaries must maintain positive tangible capital, as defined by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). Larger unrealized losses on our available for sale (AFS) portfolio due to higher market interest rates negatively impact our capital position inclusive of AOCI, including our tangible capital.\n\n## Operational Risk\n\n## Security breaches of our systems, or those of our clients or third parties, may subject us to significant liability and damage our reputation.\n\nOur business involves the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential information about our clients and us. Information security risks for financial institutions are increasing, in part because of the use of the internet and mobile and cloud technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities, including the use of artificial intelligence technologies, of organized crime, activists, hackers and other ex ternal parties, including foreign state actors. Our systems and those of other financial institutions, as well as those of our third-party service providers, have been and will continue to be the frequent target of cyber attacks, malicious code, computer viruses, ransomware, and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service or other events. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. Data security breaches may also result from non-technical means, for example, employee misconduct.\n\nGiven the high volume of transactions that we process, the large number of clients, counterparties and third-party service providers with which we do business, including cloud service providers, and the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks, a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected. The extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps we may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before an investigation is completed and full and reliable information about the attack is known. During such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack.\n\nSecurity breaches, including breaches of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers, could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws and could subject us to significant liability or loss that may not be covered by insurance, actions by our regulators, damage to our reputation, or a loss of confidence in our security measures which could harm our business.

The costs and uncertainty related to complying with such regulations continue to increase. These regulations affect our business operations and impose capital, client protection, and market conduct requirements on us as well as restrictions on the activities that we are allowed to conduct.

      "answer": "In 2022, Schwab indicated that it was retaining TD Ameritrade Institutional's customizable portfolio rebalancing solution, iRebal, as part of its offering for independent advisor clients during the integration process. By 2024, Schwab had fully incorporated iRebal into its platform as a key component of its post-acquisition strategy, alongside other integrations such as the thinkorswim trading platform. This evolution\u2014from retaining to fully incorporating iRebal\u2014demonstrates that the product maintained strategic importance and was not only preserved but also embedded into Schwab's broader service offering for RIAs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2022, Schwab stated it was retaining iRebal as part of its offering for independent advisor clients during the integration of TD Ameritrade.",
        "In 2024, Schwab described having 'incorporated' iRebal as part of its offering, indicating full integration and strategic alignment with its service model.",
        "The shift from 'retaining' to 'incorporating' indicates a progression in the product's role within Schwab's platform, showing increased strategic importance post-acquisition."

          "chunk_text": "## THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\n## Integration Overview\n\nThe acquisition of TD Ameritrade significantly increases our scale to help support the Company's ongoing efforts to enhance the client experience, provide deeper resources for individual investors as well as RIAs, and continue to improve our operating efficiency. At the time the acquisition closed, TDA had approximately $1.6 trillion in client assets and approximately 14.5 million brokerage accounts. We are actively combining the respective strengths of Schwab and TD Ameritrade and investing in enhanced client experience capabilities to further our financial success for the benefit of clients, employees, and stockholders.\n\nWe expect to transition TDA clients to Schwab within 30 to 36 months from the October 6, 2020 date of acquisition. The Company has made significant progress in its efforts to reduce overlapping or redundant roles across the two firms and has largely completed the rationalization of CS&amp;Co and TD Ameritrade, Inc. branch locations. These and other integration activities such as preparation for client transitions are expected to continue throughout the integration process. CS&amp;Co, as well as TD Ameritrade, Inc. and TDAC, will continue to operate as separate broker-dealers to serve their respective clients while integration work continues.\n\nThroughout the integration, the Company plans to generally adopt Schwab platforms and systems, though we're committed to leveraging material advantages in TD Ameritrade's platforms when appropriate, as exemplified by our retention of TD Ameritrade's thinkorswim and thinkpipes trading platforms, education, and tools into our offerings for retail and RIA clients. We are also retaining TD Ameritrade Institutional's customizable portfolio rebalancing solution iRebal as part of our offering for independent advisor clients. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\n## IDA Agreement\n\nConcurrently with the execution of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November 24, 2019, as amended (the Merger Agreement), CSC entered into an amended and restated insured deposit account agreement with the TD Depository Institutions (the IDA agreement). In accordance with the IDA agreement, which became effective October 6, 2020, cash held in eligible brokerage client accounts is swept off-balance sheet to deposit accounts at the TD Depository Institutions. Schwab provides recordkeeping and support services to the TD Depository Institutions with respect to the deposit accounts for which Schwab receives an aggregate monthly fee. Under the IDA agreement, the service fee on client cash deposits held at the TD Depository Institutions was reduced, relative to TD Ameritrade's agreement prior to acquisition, by 40%, from 25 basis points to 15 basis points for the life of the agreement. Prior to our acquisition, under TDA's prior insured deposit account agreement with the TD Depository Institutions, TDA had floors in place which enabled it to carve-out up to $20 billion of floating-rate investments from the applicable service fee during specified low-rate environments. Pursuant to the IDA agreement, the 15 basis point service fee now applies across all designated fixed and floating IDA balances.\n\nSee 'Part II - Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements' (Item 8) Note 3 for more information on the TD Ameritrade acquisition. See also 'Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7) - Capital Management' and Item 8 - Note 15 for additional information on the IDA agreement.\n\n## Acquisition of Assets of USAA's Investment Management Company and Other Acquisitions\n\nOn May 26, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of the assets of USAA's Investment Management Company (USAAIMCO). Along with the asset purchase agreement, the companies entered into a long-term referral agreement that makes Schwab the exclusive provider of wealth management and investment brokerage services for USAA members. The USAA-IMCO acquisition has added scale to the Company's operations through the addition of 1.1 million brokerage and managed portfolio accounts with approximately $80 billion in client assets at the acquisition date. The transaction also provides Schwab the opportunity to further expand our client base by serving USAA's members through the long-term referral agreement. See Item 8 Note 3 for more information on the USAA-IMCO acquisition.\n\nDuring 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of technology and intellectual property of Motif, a financial technology company. The Motif assets help us build on our existing capabilities and help accelerate our development of thematic and direct index investing for Schwab's retail investors and RIA clients. Also during 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of Wasmer, Schroeder &amp; Company, LLC (Wasmer Schroeder), which adds established strategies and new separately managed account offerings to our fixed income lineup.",

The Company's integration of Ameritrade is now complete. Through the integration, the Company generally adopted Schwab platforms and systems, though we've leveraged certain material advantages in Ameritrade's platforms, including our comprehensive integration of Ameritrade's thinkorswim  and thinkpipes trading platforms, education, and tools into our offerings for retail and RIA clients. In 2023, we launched Schwab Trading Powered by Ameritrade\u2122, an enhanced trading experience made possible by the combination of the thinkorswim trading platform with Schwab's trading capabilities on Schwab.com and Schwab Mobile. We have also incorporated Ameritrade Institutional's customizable portfolio rebalancing solution, iRebal , as part of our offering for independent advisor clients. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\nOver the course of five client transition groups in 2023 and 2024, we converted approximately $1.9 trillion in client assets across more than 17 million client accounts, including 7,000 RIAs, from Ameritrade to Schwab. In May 2024, the Company completed the conversion of the final Ameritrade client transition group to the Schwab platform. Following the completion of the final client account conversions to CS&amp;Co, TD Ameritrade, Inc., and TDAC submitted Uniform Requests for Broker-Dealer Withdrawal (BDW) to terminate their registration as broker-dealers with the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA), and other applicable regulatory organizations, and as of December 31, 2024, TD Ameritrade, Inc. and TDAC are no longer registered as broker-dealers with the SEC and FINRA.\n\nFor additional information on our integration of Ameritrade, see Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7) - Overview and Part II - Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data (Item 8) - Note 16.\n\n## IDA Agreement\n\nConcurrently with the execution of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November 24, 2019, as amended (the Merger Agreement) to acquire Ameritrade, CSC entered into an amended and restated insured deposit account agreement with TD Bank USA, National Association and TD Bank, National Association (together, the TD Depository Institutions) (the 2019 IDA agreement), which became effective October 6, 2020. On May 4, 2023, the Company executed the Second Amended and Restated Insured Deposit Account Agreement (2023 IDA agreement) with the TD Depository Institutions that replaced and superseded the 2019 IDA agreement. Consistent with the 2019 IDA agreement, in accordance with the 2023 IDA agreement, cash held in eligible brokerage client accounts is swept off-balance sheet to deposit accounts at the TD Depository Institutions. Schwab provides recordkeeping and support services to the TD Depository Institutions with respect to the deposit accounts for which Schwab receives an aggregate monthly fee. Under the 2023 IDA agreement, the service fee on client cash deposits held at the TD Depository Institutions remains at 15 basis points, as it was in the 2019 IDA agreement.\n\nFor additional information on the 2023 IDA agreement, see Part II - Item 7 - Capital Management and Item 8 - Note 15.",

Additionally, in 2023, the company introduced the Certificate of Designations for Series K, a 5.000% Fixed-Rate Reset Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, filed on March 3, 2022.

      "question": "How did Schwab's integration of the iRebal portfolio rebalancing solution evolve from 2022 to 2023, and what does this indicate about its competitive positioning in the RIA market?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Schwab stated that it was retaining TD Ameritrade Institutional's customizable portfolio rebalancing solution, iRebal, as part of its offering for independent advisor clients. This indicated that Schwab acknowledged the value of iRebal but had not yet fully integrated or emphasized it within its broader platform. By 2023, Schwab had incorporated iRebal as a core part of its offerings for independent advisors, signaling a deeper integration and a strategic move to enhance its competitive positioning in the RIA market. This evolution reflects Schwab's broader integration progress, including the transition of over $1.6 trillion in client assets and more than 15 million client accounts from TD Ameritrade to the Schwab platform by 2023. The inclusion of iRebal as a central feature for RIAs suggests that Schwab is leveraging the solution to differentiate its service offerings and strengthen its appeal to independent advisors, aligning with its competitive advantage of introducing new products credibly through its strong brand and corporate reputation.",

          "chunk_text": "## THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\n## Integration Overview\n\nThe acquisition of TD Ameritrade significantly increases our scale to help support the Company's ongoing efforts to enhance the client experience, provide deeper resources for individual investors as well as RIAs, and continue to improve our operating efficiency. At the time the acquisition closed, TDA had approximately $1.6 trillion in client assets and approximately 14.5 million brokerage accounts. We are actively combining the respective strengths of Schwab and TD Ameritrade and investing in enhanced client experience capabilities to further our financial success for the benefit of clients, employees, and stockholders.\n\nWe expect to transition TDA clients to Schwab within 30 to 36 months from the October 6, 2020 date of acquisition. The Company has made significant progress in its efforts to reduce overlapping or redundant roles across the two firms and has largely completed the rationalization of CS&amp;Co and TD Ameritrade, Inc. branch locations. These and other integration activities such as preparation for client transitions are expected to continue throughout the integration process. CS&amp;Co, as well as TD Ameritrade, Inc. and TDAC, will continue to operate as separate broker-dealers to serve their respective clients while integration work continues.\n\nThroughout the integration, the Company plans to generally adopt Schwab platforms and systems, though we're committed to leveraging material advantages in TD Ameritrade's platforms when appropriate, as exemplified by our retention of TD Ameritrade's thinkorswim and thinkpipes trading platforms, education, and tools into our offerings for retail and RIA clients. We are also retaining TD Ameritrade Institutional's customizable portfolio rebalancing solution iRebal as part of our offering for independent advisor clients. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\n## IDA Agreement\n\nConcurrently with the execution of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November 24, 2019, as amended (the Merger Agreement), CSC entered into an amended and restated insured deposit account agreement with the TD Depository Institutions (the IDA agreement). In accordance with the IDA agreement, which became effective October 6, 2020, cash held in eligible brokerage client accounts is swept off-balance sheet to deposit accounts at the TD Depository Institutions. Schwab provides recordkeeping and support services to the TD Depository Institutions with respect to the deposit accounts for which Schwab receives an aggregate monthly fee. Under the IDA agreement, the service fee on client cash deposits held at the TD Depository Institutions was reduced, relative to TD Ameritrade's agreement prior to acquisition, by 40%, from 25 basis points to 15 basis points for the life of the agreement. Prior to our acquisition, under TDA's prior insured deposit account agreement with the TD Depository Institutions, TDA had floors in place which enabled it to carve-out up to $20 billion of floating-rate investments from the applicable service fee during specified low-rate environments. Pursuant to the IDA agreement, the 15 basis point service fee now applies across all designated fixed and floating IDA balances.\n\nSee 'Part II - Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements' (Item 8) Note 3 for more information on the TD Ameritrade acquisition. See also 'Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7) - Capital Management' and Item 8 - Note 15 for additional information on the IDA agreement.\n\n## Acquisition of Assets of USAA's Investment Management Company and Other Acquisitions\n\nOn May 26, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of the assets of USAA's Investment Management Company (USAAIMCO). Along with the asset purchase agreement, the companies entered into a long-term referral agreement that makes Schwab the exclusive provider of wealth management and investment brokerage services for USAA members. The USAA-IMCO acquisition has added scale to the Company's operations through the addition of 1.1 million brokerage and managed portfolio accounts with approximately $80 billion in client assets at the acquisition date. The transaction also provides Schwab the opportunity to further expand our client base by serving USAA's members through the long-term referral agreement. See Item 8 Note 3 for more information on the USAA-IMCO acquisition.\n\nDuring 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of technology and intellectual property of Motif, a financial technology company. The Motif assets help us build on our existing capabilities and help accelerate our development of thematic and direct index investing for Schwab's retail investors and RIA clients. Also during 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of Wasmer, Schroeder &amp; Company, LLC (Wasmer Schroeder), which adds established strategies and new separately managed account offerings to our fixed income lineup.",

These costs totaled $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and are included in other expense on the consolidated statements of income. Additionally, the Company incurred various professional fees and other costs related to the USAA-IMCO acquisition, such as advisory, legal, and accounting fees. In total, the Company incurred acquisition costs of $54 million and $14 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which are primarily included in professional services, other expense, and compensation and benefits on the consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Pro Forma Financial Information (Unaudited)\n\nThe following table presents unaudited pro forma financial information as if the TD Ameritrade and USAA-IMCO acquisitions had occurred on January 1, 2019. The unaudited pro forma results reflect after-tax adjustments for acquisition costs, amortization and depreciation of acquired intangible and tangible assets, the impact of the amended IDA agreement which reduced the service fee on client cash deposits held at the TD Depository Institutions to 15 basis points from the 25 basis points paid by TD Ameritrade under its previous IDA agreement, and other immaterial adjustments for the effects of purchase accounting, and do not reflect potential revenue growth or cost savings that may be realized as a result of the acquisitions. Pro forma net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 excludes after-tax acquisition costs for both Schwab and the acquirees of $156 million. These costs and aftertax acquisition costs of $40 million incurred in 2019 by Schwab and the acquirees are included in pro forma net income for the year ended December 31, 2019.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the company used EVE simulations to measure long-term interest rate risk, with key assumptions including non-negative investment yields, prepayment speeds of mortgage-related investments, and non-maturity deposit behavior. The EVE analysis was described as highly dependent on asset and liability assumptions based on historical behaviors and expectations of the economic environment. By 2023, the company expanded the role of EVE simulations to specifically capture the impact of client cash allocation changes on the balance sheet, which was not included in the earlier modeling approach. Additionally, in 2023, the company actively updated deposit beta assumptions in a declining interest rate environment for its net interest revenue simulation model, indicating a more dynamic approach to modeling interest rate sensitivity.",

          "chunk_text": "## THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\n## Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\n\nIn addition to measuring the effect of a gradual 100 basis point parallel increase or decrease in current interest rates, we regularly simulate the effects of larger parallel- and non-parallel shifts in interest rates on net interest revenue.\n\n## Bank Deposit Account Fees Simulation\n\nConsistent with the presentation on the consolidated statement of income, the sensitivity of bank deposit account fee revenue to interest rate changes is assessed separately from the net interest revenue simulation described above. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, simulated changes in bank deposit account fee revenue from gradual 100 basis point changes in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates did not have a significant impact on the Company's total net revenues.\n\n## Economic Value of Equity Simulation\n\nManagement also uses EVE simulations to measure interest rate risk. EVE sensitivity measures the long-term impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities. EVE is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to hypothetical instantaneous shifts in the level of interest rates. This analysis is highly dependent upon asset and liability assumptions based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations of the economic environment. Key assumptions in our EVE calculation include projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors, prepayment speeds of mortgage-related investments, term structure models of interest rates, non-maturity deposit behavior, and pricing assumptions. Our net interest revenue, bank deposit account fee revenue, and EVE simulations reflect the assumption of non-negative investment yields.\n\n## Phase-out of LIBOR\n\nThe Company continues to prepare for the phasing-out of LIBOR, undertaking many efforts coordinated by its firm-wide transition team. The LIBOR transition team is overseen by executive leadership and has organized its efforts to address both client-impacting and non-client-impacting workstreams. From a client perspective, the Company has established pages on the client-facing websites for CS&amp;Co and TD Ameritrade, Inc. to provide information for our clients to help them understand how they may be impacted by LIBOR's discontinuation. In addition, we maintain internal informational resources for our client-facing employees' awareness regarding LIBOR's phase-out.\n\nThe Company's largest exposures to LIBOR are certain investment securities and loans. In purchasing new investment securities, we ensure that appropriate fallback language is in place in the event that LIBOR becomes unavailable or is deemed unreliable, and we have sold certain securities lacking appropriate fallback language. Additionally, in accordance with regulatory feedback, we are limiting our purchases of LIBOR-based securities, and we ensure that any new purchases of LIBOR-based securities were issued prior to January 1, 2022. As of December 31, 2021, substantially all of the Company's remaining investment securities with exposure to LIBOR provide for appropriate fallback in the event LIBOR is no longer available. Consistent with guidance from the Alternative Reference Rate Committee, a group of private-market participants jointly convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to help ensure a successful transition from LIBOR, the Company phased-out the use of LIBOR as a reference rate in new loans prior to year-end 2021, and the Company's portfolio of legacy loans have fallback language if LIBOR is no longer available.\n\nCertain of the Company's technology systems and financial models have historically utilized LIBOR, and we have now substantially transitioned our financial models and systems to alternative reference rates. In addition, we have transitioned the Company's IDA agreement and certain intercompany lending agreements that previously were tied to LIBOR to other appropriate reference rates.\n\nAdditional transition efforts to prepare for the phasing-out of LIBOR are ongoing. The floating dividend rates for our Series A, E, and F preferred stock are based on LIBOR. In addition, operational work remains to transition our legacy loan portfolio, in accordance with expected regulatory guidance, to alternate reference rates that are consistent with the fallback language included in the contracts.\n\n## Liquidity Risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the potential that Schwab will be unable to sell assets or meet cash flow obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable losses.",

(1)\n\nAt December 31, 2021, First Mortgage loans of $17.0 billion had adjustable interest rates. Substantially all of these mortgages have initial fixed interest rates for three to ten years and interest rates that adjust annually thereafter. Approximately 28% of the balance of these mortgages consisted of loans with interest-only payment terms. The interest rates on approximately 89% of the balance of these interest-only loans are not scheduled to reset for three or more years. Schwab's mortgage loans do not include interest terms described as temporary introductory rates below current market rates.\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, Schwab had $57 million and $43 million, respectively, of accrued interest on bank loans, which is excluded from the amortized cost basis of bank loans and included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe HELOC product has a 30-year loan term with an initial draw period of ten years from the date of origination. After the initial draw period, the balance outstanding at such time is converted to a 20-year amortizing loan. The interest rate during the initial draw period and the 20-year amortizing period is a floating rate based on the prime rate plus a margin.\n\nThe following table presents HELOCs converted to amortizing loans during each period presented:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2023, AXP emphasized evolving its card value propositions and differentiating its corporate card and accounts payable expense management solutions as part of a broader push to strengthen its position in commercial payments. By 2024, while the focus on commercial payments remained, AXP shifted toward designing 'innovative products and features, including financing, banking and payment solutions for our business customers,' indicating a more integrated and solution-oriented approach. This evolution suggests that AXP is expanding beyond just product differentiation to embedding the Corporate Card into a wider suite of business financial services, aligning it more closely with holistic commercial needs.",

      "answer": "In 2023, American Express stated that delinquency data for periods other than 90+ days past billing was 'not available due to system constraints' and therefore 'such data has not been utilized for risk management purposes.' By 2024, the language shifted to indicate that while the same system constraints persisted, the data 'has not been a material input for risk management purposes,' suggesting a qualitative shift in how the company frames the relevance of unavailable data. This change implies that even without technical limitations, the company may not view sub-90-day delinquency data as significantly impactful for risk assessment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, the company stated that delinquency data under 90 days was not available due to system constraints and therefore not used for risk management.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the company maintained that the same system constraints existed but changed the phrasing to indicate the data 'has not been a material input,' implying a shift in perceived importance rather than availability.",
        "Step 3: The change in language from 'not utilized' to 'not a material input' reflects a subtle but meaningful evolution in how American Express characterizes the role of sub-90-day delinquency data in its risk management framework."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## LIABILITY FOR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS\n\nThe Membership Rewards program is our largest card-based rewards program. Card Members can earn points for purchases charged on their enrolled card products. A significant portion of our cards, by their terms, allow Card Members to earn bonus points for purchases at merchants in particular industry categories. Membership Rewards points are redeemable for a broad variety of rewards, including, but not limited to, travel, shopping, gift cards, and statement credits. Points typically do not expire, and there is no limit on the number of points a Card Member may earn. Membership Rewards expense is driven by charge volume on enrolled cards, customer participation in the program and contractual arrangements with redemption partners.\n\nWe record a Membership Rewards liability that represents our best estimate of the cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed by Card Members in the future. The Membership Rewards liability is impacted over time by enrollment levels, attrition, the volume of points earned and redeemed, and the associated redemption costs. We estimate the Membership Rewards liability by determining the URR and the weighted average cost (WAC) per point, which are applied to the points of current enrollees. Refer to Note 9 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' for additional information.\n\nThe URR assumption is used to estimate the number of points earned by current enrollees that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods. We use statistical and actuarial models to estimate the URR of points earned to date by current Card Members based on redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, card spend levels and credit attributes. The WAC per point assumption is used to estimate future redemption costs and is primarily based on redemption choices made by Card Members, reward offerings by partners, and Membership Rewards program changes. The WAC per point assumption is derived from 12 months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations and expected developments in redemption patterns.\n\nWe periodically evaluate our liability estimation process and assumptions based on changes in cost per point redeemed, partner contract changes and developments in redemption patterns, which may be impacted by product refreshes, changes in redemption options and mix of proprietary cards-in-force.\n\nThe process of estimating the Membership Rewards liability includes a high degree of judgment. Actual redemptions and associated redemption costs could differ significantly from our estimates, resulting in either higher or lower Membership Rewards expense.\n\nChanges in the Membership Rewards URR and WAC per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the liability through the current period Membership Rewards expense by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by current enrollees as of the end of the reporting period. As of December 31, 2024, an increase in the estimated URR of current enrollees of 25 basis points would increase the Membership Rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $197 million. Similarly, an increase in the WAC per point of 1 basis point would increase the Membership Rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $220 million.\n\n## GOODWILL RECOVERABILITY\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances arise, such as adverse changes in the business environment, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. Our methodology for conducting this goodwill impairment testing contains both a qualitative and quantitative assessment.\n\nWe have the option to initially perform an assessment of qualitative factors in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other company and reporting unit-specific events. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we then perform the impairment evaluation using a more detailed quantitative assessment. We could also directly perform this quantitative assessment for any reporting unit, bypassing the qualitative assessment.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Morgan Stanley concluded that in most re-securitization transactions, CLNs, and other asset-repackaging notes, the decisions made prior to the initial closing were shared between the Firm and the initial investors. This determination was based on factors such as the nature of the assets, the extent of information available to both parties, the number and nature of investors, and the level of continuing involvement by the Firm. By 2024, the Firm continued to emphasize that decision-making authority before initial closing remained a shared responsibility between the Firm and investors, with no significant economic decisions made on an ongoing basis. However, the 2024 filing placed more emphasis on the standardization of legal documentation and the absence of termination rights in these structures, suggesting a more streamlined and controlled process compared to the previous year.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2023, the Firm analyzed decision-making authority in re-securitization transactions and concluded that decisions prior to initial closing were shared between the Firm and investors, based on factors such as asset nature, investor involvement, and continuing interest levels.",
        "In 2024, the Firm reaffirmed that no significant ongoing economic decisions were made in these transactions and that control decisions were still focused on initial and termination rights. However, the 2024 filing introduced new emphasis on standardized legal documentation and the absence of termination rights, indicating a more systematized approach.",
        "The evolution between 2023 and 2024 reflects a continued emphasis on shared initial decision-making but with a more structured and standardized process in 2024, as evidenced by the additional focus on legal documentation and lack of termination rights."

Variable Interest Entities and Securitization Activities\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Firm is involved with various SPEs in the normal course of business. In most cases, these entities are deemed to be VIEs.\n\nThe  Firm's  variable  interests  in  V IEs  include  debt  and  equity  interests, commitments, guarantees, derivative instruments and certain fees. The Firm's involvement with VIEs arises primarily from:\n\n- Interests purchased in connection with market-making activities, securities held in its  Investment securities portfolio and retained interests held as a result of securitization activities, including re-securitization transactions.\n- Guarantees  issued  and  residual  interests  retained  in  connection  with municipal bond securitizations.\n- Loans made to and investments in VIEs that hold debt, equity, real estate or other assets.\n- Derivatives entered into with VIEs.\n- Structuring of CLNs or other asset-repackaging notes designed to meet the investment objectives of clients.\n- Other structured transactions designed to provide tax-efficient yields to the Firm or its clients.\n\nThe Firm determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE upon its initial  involvement  with  the  V IE  and  reassesses  whether  it  is  the  primary beneficiary on an ongoing basis as long as it has any continuing involvement with the VIE. This determination is based upon an analysis of the design of the  VIE,  including  the  V IE's  structure  and  activities,  the  power  to  make significant economic decisions held by the Firm and by other parties, and the variable interests owned by the Firm and other parties.\n\nThe  power  to  make  the  most  significant  economic  decisions  may  take  a number  of  different  forms  in  different  types  of  V IEs.  The  Firm  considers servicing  or  collateral  management  decisions  as  representing  the  power  to make  the  most  significant  economic  decisions  in  transactions  such  as securitizations or CDOs.  As  a result, the Firm does not consolidate securitizations or CDOs for which it does not act as the servicer or collateral manager unless it holds certain other rights to replace the servicer or collateral manager  or  to  require  the  liquidation  of  the  entity.  If  the  Firm  serves  as servicer  or  collateral  manager,  or  has  certain  other  rights  described  in  the previous sentence, the Firm analyzes the interests in the VIE that it holds and consolidates  only  those  VIEs  for  which  it  holds  a  potentially  significant interest in the V IE.\n\nFor many transactions, such as re-securitization transactions, CLNs and other asset-repackaging notes, there are no significant economic decisions made on an ongoing basis. In these cases, the Firm focuses its analysis on decisions made prior to the initial closing of the transaction and at the termination of the transaction. The Firm concluded in most of these transactions that decisions made prior to the initial closing were shared between the Firm and the initial investors based upon the nature of the assets, including whether the assets were  issued  in  a  transaction  sponsored  by  the  Firm  and  the  ex tent  of  the information  available  to  the  Firm  and  to  investors,  the  number,  nature  and involvement  of  investors,  other  rights  held  by  the  Firm  and  investors,  the standardization  of  the  legal  documentation  and  the  level  of  continuing involvement by the Firm, including the amount and type of interests owned by the Firm and by other investors. The Firm focused its control decision on any right held by the Firm or investors related to the termination of the VIE. Most re-securitization transactions, CLNs and other asset-repackaging notes have no such termination rights.\n\n## Consolidated VIE  Assets and Liabilities by Type of Activity\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2023, recently executed transactions were a key input for determining the fair value of corporate loans and contingent lending commitments, often used alongside market price quotations, implied yields, and proprietary valuation models. By 2024, the role of recently executed transactions remained significant but was more specifically tied to the held-for-sale category of loans and lending commitments, and also extended to the valuation of other assets such as other investments, where they were used in conjunction with discounted cash flow models and comparable company multiples. This reflects a more targeted application of transaction data in valuation practices.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, recently executed transactions were used broadly across corporate loans and contingent lending commitments for fair value determination.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the use of recently executed transactions was more narrowly associated with the held-for-sale loan category and expanded to include other assets like other investments.",
        "Step 3: The evolution indicates a shift from general usage to a more segmented and specific application, suggesting a refinement in valuation methodology."

      "answer": "In 2023, the firm stated that the value of assets, including those backed by commercial assets, was determined based on the fair value of the liabilities and the interests owned by the firm in such VIEs, as these fair values were more observable. In 2024, the disclosure remained consistent in principle but introduced a nuance by emphasizing that the fair values for the liabilities and interests owned 'are more observable,' suggesting a refined justification for the valuation approach. This indicates a subtle evolution in how the firm communicates its rationale for asset valuation, possibly in response to regulatory or market scrutiny.",

        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 \u2014 In 2023, the valuation of assets (including commercial assets) was based on the fair value of liabilities and the firm's interests in VIEs because these values were more observable.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 \u2014 In 2024, the firm reiterated the same valuation method but added emphasis on the observability of fair values for liabilities and interests, suggesting a more deliberate explanation of the methodology.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change \u2014 The change is one of communication and emphasis rather than substance, indicating a transformation in how the firm articulates its valuation rationale, possibly to enhance transparency or address external concerns."

      "answer": "In 2023, BlackRock emphasized the risks associated with its dependency on a concentrated group of third-party providers for fund administration, highlighting concerns around operational reliability, limited alternatives, and potential financial exposure due to long-term contracts. By 2024, the company expanded its disclosure to include more operational and cost-related details, such as the treatment of direct fund expenses, which include custodial services, fund accounting, transfer agent services, and shareholder reporting. These expenses are now explicitly stated as being incurred directly by BlackRock and expensed as incurred, signaling a more transparent approach to cost management and operational accountability in its third-party fund administration relationships.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, BlackRock disclosed operational and financial risks tied to its reliance on a limited number of third-party fund administration providers, noting the lack of alternatives and potential for operational disruptions.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, BlackRock detailed specific cost elements related to third-party fund administration, such as custodial services, fund accounting, and transfer agent services, which are expensed as incurred.",
        "Step 3: The evolution from risk-focused disclosure in 2023 to a more detailed operational and cost-based disclosure in 2024 indicates a shift toward greater transparency and operational clarity regarding third-party fund administration."

          "chunk_text": "The Com pany records a liability for deferred carried interest to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to m eeting the revenue recognition criteria. A portion of the deferred carried interest m ay also be paid to certain em ployees. T he ultim ate tim ing of the recognition of perform ance fee revenue and related com pensation expense, if any, is unknown.\n\nTechnology services revenue. The C om pany offers investm ent m anagem ent technology system s, risk m anagem ent services, wealth m anagem ent and digital distribution tools, all on a fee basis. C lients include banks, insurance com panies, official institutions, pension funds, asset m anagers, retail distributors and other investors. F ees earned for technology services are prim arily recorded as services are perform ed over tim e and are generally determ ined using the value of positions on the Aladdin platform , or on a fixed-rate basis. R evenue derived from  the sale of software licenses is recognized upon the granting of access rights.\n\nDistribution Fees. The C om pany earns distribution and service fees related to distributing investm ent products and shareholder support services for investm ent portfolios. D istribution fees are passed-through to third-party distributors, which perform  various fund distribution services and shareholder servicing of certain funds on the C om pany's behalf, and are recognized as distribution and servicing costs. T he C om pany presents distribution fees and related distribution and servicing costs incurred on a gross basis.\n\nDistribution fees prim arily consist of ongoing distribution fees, shareholder servicing fees and upfront sales com m issions for serving as the principal underwriter and/or distributor for certain m anaged m utual funds. T he service of distribution is satisfied at the point in tim e when an investor m akes an investm ent in a share class of the m anaged m utual funds. F ees are generally considered variable consideration because they are based on the value of AU M  and are uncertain on trade date. Accordingly, the C om pany recognizes distribution fees when the am ounts becom e known and the portion recognized in the current period m ay relate to distribution services perform ed in prior periods. U pfront sales com m issions are recognized on a trade date basis. Shareholder servicing fees are based on AU M  and recognized in revenue as the services are perform ed.\n\nAdvisory and other revenue. Advisory and other revenue prim arily includes fees earned for advisory services, fees earned for transition m anagem ent services prim arily com prised of commissions recognized in connection with buying and selling securities on behalf of custom ers, and equity m ethod investm ent earnings related to certain strategic investm ents.\n\nAdvisory services fees are determ ined using fixed-rate fees and are recognized over tim e as the related services are com pleted.\n\nCommissions related to transition m anagem ent services are recorded on a trade-date basis as transactions occur.\n\nStock-based Compensation . T he C om pany recognizes com pensation cost for equity classified awards based on the grant-date fair value of the award. T he com pensation cost is recognized over the period during which an em ployee is required to provide service (usually the vesting period) in exchange for the stock-based award.\n\nThe Com pany generally m easures the grant-date fair value of restricted stock units ('R SU s') using the C om pany's stock price on the date of grant. T he grant-date fair value related to the October 2024 incentive retention R SU s granted in connection with the G IP  T ransaction, are reduced by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the shares during the vesting period discounted at the appropriate risk-free interest rate, given that they are not entitled to participate in dividends until they vest (See N ote 3, Acquisitions and Note 18, Stock-Based Compensation for further inform ation on the G I P  T ransaction). Stock-based awards m ay have perform ance, m arket and/or service conditions. F or em ployee stock options and awards with m arket conditions, the C om pany uses pricing m odels. C om pensation cost for awards containing perform ance conditions is recognized if it is probable that the conditions will be achieved. T he probability of achievem ent is assessed on a quarterly basis. If a stock-based award is m odified after the grant-date, increm ental compensation cost is recognized for an am ount equal to the excess of the fair value of the m odified award over the fair value of the original award im m ediately before the modification. Awards under the C om pany's stock-based com pensation plans vest over various periods. C om pensation cost is recorded by the C om pany on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separate vesting portion of the award as if the award is, in-substance, m ultiple awards and is adjusted for actual forfeitures as they occur.\n\nThe Com pany am ortizes the grant-date fair value of stock-based com pensation awards m ade to retirem ent-eligible em ployees over the requisite service period. U pon notification of retirem ent, the C om pany accelerates the unam ortized portion of the award over the contractually required retirem ent notification period.\n\nThe Com pany recognizes all excess tax benefits and deficiencies in incom e tax expense on the consolidated statem ents of incom e, which results in volatility of incom e tax expense as a result of fluctuations in the C om pany's stock price. Accordingly, the C om pany recorded a discrete incom e tax benefit of $37 m illion, $41 m illion and $87 m illion during 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, for vested R SU s where the grant date stock price was lower than the vesting date stock price.\n\nDistribution and Servicing Costs . D istribution and servicing costs include paym ents to third parties, prim arily associated with distribution and servicing of client investm ents in certain BlackR ock products. D istribution and servicing costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nDirect Fund Expense . D irect fund expense, which is expensed as incurred, prim arily consists of third-party non-advisory expense incurred by BlackR ock related to certain investm ent products for the use of certain index tradem arks, reference data for certain indices, custodial services, fund adm inistration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services, audit and tax services as well as other fund-related expense directly attributable to the non-advisory operations of the fund.\n\nLeases . T he C om pany determ ines if a contract is a lease or contains a lease at inception. T he C om pany accounts for its office facility leases as operating leases, which m ay include escalation clauses that are based on an index or m arket rate. T he C om pany accounts for lease and non-lease com ponents, including com m on areas m aintenance charges, as a single component for its leases. The C om pany elected the short-term  lease exception for leases with an initial term  of 12 m onths or less. C onsequently, such leases are not recorded on the consolidated statem ents of financial condition. T he C om pany's lease term s include options to extend or term inate the lease when it is reasonably certain they will be exercised or not.",

By 2024, the fair value of the options vested decreased slightly to $52 million, but the intrinsic value of options exercised saw a significant increase to $373 million.

      "answer": "In 2023, MetLife disclosed that its includable life insurance and non-life insurance subsidiaries filed a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return, while non-includable subsidiaries filed either separate individual corporate tax returns or separate consolidated tax returns. In 2024, MetLife maintained the same structure for includable subsidiaries but added more detailed language about the realization of deferred tax assets and the application of enacted tax rates to temporary differences. This evolution shows a refinement in MetLife's tax accounting policies while maintaining the same regulatory filing structure. The change indicates a more nuanced approach to tax compliance and reporting, particularly in the treatment of deferred tax assets and liabilities.",

        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The core filing structure remained stable, but the addition of detailed tax accounting language in 2024 shows an evolution in MetLife's tax reporting transparency and regulatory compliance approach."

Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\n\n## Employee Benefit Plans\n\nCertain subsidiaries of MetLife, Inc. sponsor defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans covering eligible employees. Measurement dates used for all of the subsidiaries' defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans correspond with the fiscal year ends of sponsoring subsidiaries, which is December 31 for U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries.\n\nThe Company recognizes the funded status of each of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, measured as the difference between the fair value  of  plan  assets  and  the  benefit  obligation,  which  is  the  projected  benefit  obligation  ('PBO')  for  pension  benefits  and  the  accumulated  postretirement  benefit obligation ('APBO') for other postretirement benefits in other assets or other liabilities.\n\nActuarial gains and losses result from differences between each plan's actual experience and the assumed experience on plan assets or PBO/APBO during a particular period and are recorded in accumulated OCI ('AOCI'). To the extent such gains and losses exceed 10% of the greater of the PBO/APBO or the estimated fair value of plan assets, the excess is amortized into net periodic benefit costs, generally over the average projected future service years of the active employees. In addition, prior service costs (credit) are recognized in AOCI at the time of the amendment and then amortized to net periodic benefit costs over the average projected future service years of the active employees.\n\nNet periodic benefit costs are determined using management's estimates and actuarial assumptions and are comprised of service cost, interest cost, settlement and curtailment  costs,  ex pected  return  on  plan  assets,  amortization  of  net  actuarial  (gains)  losses,  and  amortization  of  prior  service  costs  (credit).  Fair  value  is  used  to determine the expected return on plan assets.\n\nThe subsidiaries also sponsor defined contribution plans for substantially all U.S. employees under which a portion of employee contributions is matched. Applicable matching contributions are made each payroll period. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation cost for current matching contributions. As all contributions are transferred currently as earned to the defined contribution plans, no liability for matching contributions is recognized on the balance sheets.\n\n## Income Tax\n\nMetLife, Inc. and its includable life insurance and non-life insurance subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax  return in accordance with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Non-includable subsidiaries file either separate individual corporate tax returns or separate consolidated tax returns.\n\nThe Company's accounting for income taxes represents management's best estimate of various events and transactions.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities are measured at the balance sheet date using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse.\n\nThe realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law in the applicable tax jurisdiction. V aluation allowances are established against deferred tax  assets when management determines, based on available information, that it is more likely than not that deferred income tax assets will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining whether valuation allowances should be established, as well as the amount of such allowances. When making such determination, the Company considers many factors, including:",

      "answer": "In 2023, MetLife described foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as potentially making certain products 'less attractive to customers,' which could 'increase levels of early policy terminations.' In 2024, the language remained similar but took on a stronger causal tone, stating that such fluctuations 'may increase levels of early policy terminations'\u2014a shift from a conditional to a more direct implication of risk. This evolution in phrasing suggests a heightened concern about the link between currency volatility and customer behavior, indicating a more assertive stance in framing the risk as a probable rather than potential outcome.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Real Estate Risks\n\nChanges in leasable commercial space supply and demand, lessee behaviors, pandemics and other public health issues, creditworthiness of tenants and partners, capital  markets  volatility,  interest  rate  fluctuations,  commodity  prices,  farm  incomes,  housing  and  commercial  property  market  conditions,  and  real  estate  investment supply and demand may adversely impact our investments in commercial, agricultural and residential mortgage loans, and real estate equity investments including joint ventures.\n\n## Political, Obligor and Counterparty Risks\n\nOur general account investments in certain countries could be adversely affected by volatility resulting  from  local  economic  and  political  concerns,  as  well  as volatility in specific sectors. G overnment entities may face budget deficits and other financial difficulties, which may harm the value of securities we hold issued by or under the auspices of such governments. In the U.S., a threat facing the economy is the continued disagreement over the federal debt limit, other budget questions, and potential  restrictions  on  trade  with  other  markets.  Failure  to  resolve  these  issues  in  a  timely  manner  could  result  in  a  government  shutdown,  erratic  reduction  in government spending or a default on government debt, which could result in increased market volatility and reduced economic activity.\n\nThe issuers or guarantors of fixed income securities and mortgage loans we own may more frequently default on principal and interest payments they owe us. Additionally, the change in value of underlying collateral within instruments backed by securitized assets may result in a default on principal and interest payments, reducing our cash flows. The occurrence of a major economic downturn, acts of corporate malfeasance, widening credit spreads, or other adverse events may increase the default rate of the fix ed income securities and mortgage loans in our investment portfolio.\n\nMany of our transactions with counterparties expose us to the risk of counterparty default. Such credit risk may be exacerbated if we cannot realize on the collateral held  by  us  in  secured  transactions  or  cannot  liquidate  such  collateral  at  prices  sufficient  to  recover  the  full  amount  of  the  loan  or  derivative  ex posure  due  to  us. Furthermore, potential action by governments and regulatory bodies, or lack of action by governments and central banks, as well as deterioration in the banks' credit standing, could negatively impact these instruments, securities, transactions and investments or limit our ability to trade with them.\n\nOur efforts to manage our total exposure to a single counterparty or limited number of counterparties within or among any of our investment, derivative, treasury, and reinsurance relationships, which we adjust from time to time, may not completely or adequately mitigate counterparty risks.\n\n## Currency Exchange Rate Risks\n\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar may adversely affect our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments, investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, net income from non-U.S. operations and issuance of non-U.S. dollar denominated instruments. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may also make certain of our products less attractive to customers, which may increase levels of early policy terminations and decrease sales volume and our in-force business. Such negative effects may be exacerbated if international markets experience severe economic or financial disruptions or significant currency devaluations, if a foreign economy is determined to be 'highly inflationary,' or if a country withdraws from the Eurozone. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may harm our operations, earnings or investments in the affected countries.\n\nWe may be unable to mitigate the risk of such changes in exchange rates due to unhedged positions, asymmetrical and non-economic accounting resulting from derivative gains (losses) on non-qualifying hedges, the failure of hedges to effectively offset the impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation, or other factors. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect the translation of results into our U.S. dollar basis consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Derivatives Risks\n\nIf our counterparties, clearing brokers or central clearinghouses fail or refuse to honor their obligations under our derivatives agreements, our risks may not be fully hedged. A counterparty, clearing broker, or central clearinghouse may become insolvent or otherwise unable or unwilling to make payments or to return collateral under the terms of derivatives agreements, increasing our costs or resulting in significant losses. If the net estimated fair value of a derivative to which we are a party declines, we may need to pledge additional collateral or make increased payments. In addition, we may face increased costs to the extent we replace counterparties or clearing brokers who suffer financial difficulties. Furthermore, our derivatives valuations may change based on changes to our valuation methodology or errors in such valuation or valuation methodology.",

      "question": "How has MetLife's application of GAAP guidance for adjusted earnings evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of the exclusions related to market volatility and asymmetrical accounting adjustments?",
      "answer": "In 2023, MetLife updated its calculation of adjusted earnings due to the adoption of LDTI, which led to the exclusion of certain adjustments related to the amortization of DAC, VOBA, and related intangibles, as well as changes in measurement of certain guarantees. Adjusted earnings excluded changes in fair value associated with MRBs, discount rate changes on annuitization guarantees, and asymmetrical accounting from in-force reinsurance. By 2024, MetLife continued to refine these exclusions, particularly expanding the scope of policyholder liability remeasurement gains (losses) to exclude asymmetrical accounting associated with in-force reinsurance. Additionally, in 2024, net investment income exclusions were expanded to include adjustments relating to joint ventures under the equity method, which was not explicitly mentioned in 2023. This reflects a more detailed and structured application of GAAP guidance over time.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, MetLife adjusted its earnings calculation due to LDTI adoption, removing DAC, VOBA, and certain guarantee adjustments from adjusted earnings.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, MetLife further refined adjusted earnings by explicitly excluding joint venture impacts under the equity method and expanding exclusions in policyholder liability remeasurement.",
        "Step 3: The evolution shows a transformation in how MetLife applies GAAP guidance, with increasing specificity and refinement in exclusions related to market volatility and asymmetrical accounting."

Segment Information (continued)\n\n## Latin America\n\nThe Latin America segment offers a broad range of products to both individuals and corporations, as well as to other institutions, and their respective employees, which include life insurance, retirement and savings, accident &amp; health insurance and credit insurance.\n\n## EMEA\n\nThe  EMEA segment offers  products  to  individuals,  corporations,  other  institutions,  and  their  respective  employees,  which  include  life  insurance,  retirement  and savings, accident &amp; health insurance and credit insurance.\n\n## MetLife Holdings\n\nThe MetLife Holdings segment consists of operations relating to products and businesses that the Company no longer actively markets in the U.S. These include variable, universal, term and whole life insurance, variable, fixed and index-linked annuities and long-term care insurance. It also includes an in-force block of assumed variable annuity guarantees from a third party.\n\n## Financial Measure and Segment Accounting Policies\n\nAdjusted  earnings  is  used  by  the  Company's  CODM,  its  chief  ex ecutive  officer,  to  evaluate  performance  and  allocate  resources. Adjusted  earnings  and  related measures based on adjusted earnings are also the measures by which senior management's and many other employees' performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans. Adjusted earnings and related measures based on adjusted earnings allow analysis of the Company's performance relative to its business plan and facilitate comparisons to industry results.\n\nConsistent with  GAAP guidance for segment reporting, adjusted earnings is the  Company's  GAAP measure of segment performance and is reported below.  The Company believes  the  presentation  of  adjusted  earnings  enhances  its  investors'  understanding  of  its  performance  by  highlighting  the  results  of  operations  and  the underlying profitability drivers of the business.\n\nAdjusted earnings focuses on the Company's primary businesses principally by excluding the impact of (i) market volatility which could distort trends, (ii) asymmetrical and non-economic accounting, (iii) revenues and costs related to divested businesses, and (iv) other adjustments. Also, adjusted earnings excludes results of discontinued operations under GAAP.\n\nMarket volatility can have a significant impact on the Company's financial results. Adjusted earnings for the Company's segments excludes net investment gains (losses), net derivative gains (losses), MRB remeasurement gains (losses) and goodwill impairments. Further, net investment income excludes adjusted earnings adjustments relating to joint ventures accounted for under the equity method, and policyholder benefits and claims exclude (i) changes in the discount rate on certain annuitization guarantees accounted for as additional liabilities and (ii) market value adjustments.\n\nAsymmetrical and non-economic accounting adjustments are made in calculating adjusted earnings for the Company's segments:\n\n- Net investment income includes earned income on derivatives and amortization of premium on derivatives that are hedges of investments or that are used to replicate certain investments, but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.\n- Other revenues include settlements of foreign currency earnings hedges and exclude asymmetrical accounting associated with in-force reinsurance.\n- Policyholder benefits and claims excludes (i) amortization of basis adjustments associated with de-designated fair value hedges of  FPBs, (ii) inflation-indexed benefit adjustments associated with contracts backed by inflation-indexed investments, (iii) asymmetrical accounting associated with in-force reinsurance, and (iv) non-economic  losses  incurred  at  contract  inception  for  certain  single  premium  annuity  business.  These  losses  are  amortized  into  adjusted  earnings  within policyholder benefits and claims over the estimated lives of the contracts.\n- Policyholder liability remeasurement gains (losses) excludes asymmetrical accounting associated with in-force reinsurance.\n\n## MetLife, Inc.\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)",

      "question": "How has MetLife's treatment and definition of Adjusted Earnings evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in relation to GAAP guidance and segment performance measurement?",
      "answer": "In 2023, MetLife updated its calculation of Adjusted Earnings due to the adoption of LDTI, removing certain adjustments related to the amortization of DAC, VOBA, and related intangibles, and instead adjusted for changes in measurement of certain guarantees. Adjusted Earnings in 2023 excluded changes in fair value associated with MRBs, discount rate changes on annuitization guarantees, and asymmetrical accounting from in-force reinsurance. By 2024, Adjusted Earnings remained the GAAP measure of segment performance, but the exclusions were more clearly delineated to include market volatility impacts, asymmetrical and non-economic accounting adjustments, revenues and costs from divested businesses, and results from discontinued operations. Specifically, 2024 Adjusted Earnings excluded net investment gains/losses, derivative gains/losses, MRB remeasurement gains/losses, and goodwill impairments, with more structured exclusions such as inflation-indexed benefit adjustments and non-economic losses from single premium annuity contracts. This represents a refinement and expansion of the exclusions introduced in 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, MetLife adjusted its calculation of Adjusted Earnings due to LDTI adoption, removing DAC, VOBA, and related intangible amortization adjustments and adding exclusions for MRBs, discount rate changes on annuitization guarantees, and asymmetrical accounting from in-force reinsurance.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, Adjusted Earnings continued to serve as the GAAP measure of segment performance but included more detailed and structured exclusions such as inflation-indexed benefit adjustments, non-economic losses from single premium annuities, and clearer delineation of market volatility and divestiture-related adjustments.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a transformation in the treatment of Adjusted Earnings, with 2024 showing a more mature and detailed framework for exclusions and adjustments, indicating a significant evolution in how MetLife aligns Adjusted Earnings with GAAP guidance and segment performance measurement."

Segment Information (continued)\n\n## Latin America\n\nThe Latin America segment offers a broad range of products to both individuals and corporations, as well as to other institutions, and their respective employees, which include life insurance, retirement and savings, accident &amp; health insurance and credit insurance.\n\n## EMEA\n\nThe  EMEA segment offers  products  to  individuals,  corporations,  other  institutions,  and  their  respective  employees,  which  include  life  insurance,  retirement  and savings, accident &amp; health insurance and credit insurance.\n\n## MetLife Holdings\n\nThe MetLife Holdings segment consists of operations relating to products and businesses that the Company no longer actively markets in the U.S. These include variable, universal, term and whole life insurance, variable, fixed and index-linked annuities and long-term care insurance. It also includes an in-force block of assumed variable annuity guarantees from a third party.\n\n## Financial Measure and Segment Accounting Policies\n\nAdjusted  earnings  is  used  by  the  Company's  CODM,  its  chief  ex ecutive  officer,  to  evaluate  performance  and  allocate  resources. Adjusted  earnings  and  related measures based on adjusted earnings are also the measures by which senior management's and many other employees' performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans. Adjusted earnings and related measures based on adjusted earnings allow analysis of the Company's performance relative to its business plan and facilitate comparisons to industry results.\n\nConsistent with  GAAP guidance for segment reporting, adjusted earnings is the  Company's  GAAP measure of segment performance and is reported below.  The Company believes  the  presentation  of  adjusted  earnings  enhances  its  investors'  understanding  of  its  performance  by  highlighting  the  results  of  operations  and  the underlying profitability drivers of the business.\n\nAdjusted earnings focuses on the Company's primary businesses principally by excluding the impact of (i) market volatility which could distort trends, (ii) asymmetrical and non-economic accounting, (iii) revenues and costs related to divested businesses, and (iv) other adjustments. Also, adjusted earnings excludes results of discontinued operations under GAAP.\n\nMarket volatility can have a significant impact on the Company's financial results. Adjusted earnings for the Company's segments excludes net investment gains (losses), net derivative gains (losses), MRB remeasurement gains (losses) and goodwill impairments. Further, net investment income excludes adjusted earnings adjustments relating to joint ventures accounted for under the equity method, and policyholder benefits and claims exclude (i) changes in the discount rate on certain annuitization guarantees accounted for as additional liabilities and (ii) market value adjustments.\n\nAsymmetrical and non-economic accounting adjustments are made in calculating adjusted earnings for the Company's segments:\n\n- Net investment income includes earned income on derivatives and amortization of premium on derivatives that are hedges of investments or that are used to replicate certain investments, but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.\n- Other revenues include settlements of foreign currency earnings hedges and exclude asymmetrical accounting associated with in-force reinsurance.\n- Policyholder benefits and claims excludes (i) amortization of basis adjustments associated with de-designated fair value hedges of  FPBs, (ii) inflation-indexed benefit adjustments associated with contracts backed by inflation-indexed investments, (iii) asymmetrical accounting associated with in-force reinsurance, and (iv) non-economic  losses  incurred  at  contract  inception  for  certain  single  premium  annuity  business.  These  losses  are  amortized  into  adjusted  earnings  within policyholder benefits and claims over the estimated lives of the contracts.\n- Policyholder liability remeasurement gains (losses) excludes asymmetrical accounting associated with in-force reinsurance.\n\n## MetLife, Inc.\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)",

      "answer": "In 2023, MetLife described the cost basis for Unit-linked and FVO securities as primarily equity and fixed maturity securities, with cost representing original cost for equities and amortized cost for fixed maturities. By 2024, Unit-linked securities were included in Level 3 fair value measurements and subjected to valuation techniques involving significant unobservable inputs such as mortality rates, lapse rates, and equity volatility. Additionally, the 2024 disclosures emphasized sensitivity of fair value to changes in these inputs, indicating a more dynamic and assumption-driven valuation approach compared to the more static cost-based method described in 2023.",

Fair Value (continued)\n\n- (7) Changes in estimated fair value are based on long U.S. dollar net asset positions and will be inversely impacted for short U.S. dollar net asset positions.\n- (8) Mortality  rates  vary  by  age  and  by  demographic  characteristics  such  as  gender.  Mortality  rate  assumptions  are  based  on  company  ex perience.  A  mortality improvement assumption is also applied. For any given contract, mortality rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for purposes of valuing the MRBs. For contracts that contain only a GMDB, any increase (decrease) in mortality rates result in an increase (decrease) in the estimated fair value of MRBs. Generally, for contracts that contain both a GMDB and a living benefit (e.g., GMIB, GMWB, GMAB), any increase (decrease) in mortality rates result in a decrease (increase) in the estimated fair value of MRBs.\n- (9) Base lapse rates are adjusted at the contract level based on a comparison of the actuarially calculated guaranteed values and the current policyholder account value, as well as other factors, such as the applicability of any surrender charges. A dynamic lapse function reduces the base lapse rate when the guaranteed amount is greater than the account value as in the money contracts are less likely to lapse. Lapse rates are also generally assumed to be lower in periods when a surrender charge applies. For any given contract, lapse rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for purposes of valuing the MRBs.\n- (10) The utilization rate assumption estimates the percentage of contractholders with GMIBs or a lifetime withdrawal benefit who will elect to utilize the benefit upon becoming eligible. The rates may vary by the type of guarantee, the amount by which the guaranteed amount is greater than the account value, the contract's withdrawal history and by the age of the policyholder. For any given contract, utilization rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for purposes of valuing the MRBs.\n- (11) The withdrawal rate represents the percentage of account balance that any given policyholder will elect to withdraw from the contract each year. The withdrawal rate assumption varies by age and duration of the contract, and also by other factors such as benefit type. For any given contract, withdrawal rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for purposes of valuing the MRBs. For GMWBs, any increase (decrease) in withdrawal rates results in an increase (decrease) in the estimated fair value of the guarantees. For GMABs and GMIBs, any increase (decrease) in withdrawal rates results in a decrease (increase) in the estimated fair value.\n- (12) Long-term equity volatilities represent equity volatility beyond the period for which observable equity volatilities are available. For any given contract, long-term equity volatility rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for purposes of valuing the MRBs.\n\n(13) Nonperformance risk spread varies by duration and by currency. For any given contract, multiple nonperformance risk spreads will apply, depending on the duration of the cash flow being discounted for purposes of valuing the MRBs.\n\nAll other classes of securities classified within  Level 3, including those within Unit-linked and FVO securities, Other investments, Separate account assets, and Embedded derivatives within funds withheld related to certain ceded reinsurance, use the same valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs as previously described for Level 3 securities. G enerally, all other classes of assets and liabilities classified within Level 3 that are not included above use the same valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs as previously described for Level 3. The sensitivity of the estimated fair value to changes in the significant unobservable inputs for these other assets and liabilities is similar in nature to that described in the preceding table.

        "Step 3: The treatment of the CECL impact on regulatory capital remained stable across both years, with no change in the 25% annual phase-in rate, indicating a continuation of the same regulatory capital treatment throughout the transition period."

The Basel III Capital Rules implement certain capital requirements published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ('Basel Committee'), along with certain provisions of the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 ('Dodd-Frank Act') and other capital provisions.\n\nAs a bank holding company ('BHC') with total consolidated assets of at least $250 billion but less than $700 billion and not exceeding any of the applicable risk-based thresholds, the Company is a Category III institution under the Basel III Capital Rules.\n\nThe Bank, as a subsidiary of a Category III institution, is a Category III bank. Moreover, the Bank, as an insured depository institution, is subject to prompt corrective action ('PCA') capital regulations.\n\nUnder the Basel III Capital Rules, we must maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 ('CET1') capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% and a total capital ratio of 8.0%, in each case in relation to risk-weighted assets. In addition, we must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% and a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3.0%. We are also subject to the capital conservation buffer requirement and countercyclical capital buffer requirement, each as described in 'Part I-Item 1. Business-Supervision and Regulation-Capital and Stress Testing Regulation-Stress Capital Buffer Rule.' Our capital and leverage ratios are calculated based on the Basel III standardized approach framework.\n\nWe have elected to exclude certain elements of accumulated other comprehensive income ('AOCI') from our regulatory capital as permitted for a Category III institution. For information on the recognition of AOCI in regulatory capital under the proposed changes to the Basel III Capital Rules, see 'Part I-Item 1. Business-Supervision and Regulation-Capital and Stress Testing Regulation-Basel III Finalization Proposal.'\n\nThe Federal Reserve, OCC, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ('FDIC') (collectively, 'Federal Banking Agencies') adopted a final rule ('CECL Transition Rule') that provides banking institutions an optional five-year transition period to phase in the impact of the CECL standard on their regulatory capital (the 'CECL Transition Election'). We adopted the CECL standard (for accounting purposes) as of January 1, 2020, and made the CECL Transition Election (for regulatory capital purposes) in the first quarter of 2020. Therefore, the applicable amounts presented in this Report reflect such election.\n\nPursuant to the CECL Transition Rule, a banking institution could elect to delay the estimated impact of adopting CECL on its regulatory capital through December 31, 2021 and then phase in the estimated cumulative impact from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. For the 'day 2' ongoing impact of CECL during the initial two years, the Federal Banking Agencies used a uniform 'scaling factor' of 25% as an approximation of the increase in the allowance under the CECL standard compared to the prior incurred loss methodology. Accordingly, from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021, electing banking institutions were permitted to add back to their regulatory capital an amount equal to the sum of the after-tax  'day 1' CECL adoption impact and 25% of the increase in the allowance since the adoption of the CECL standard. From January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024, the after-tax 'day 1' CECL adoption impact and the cumulative 'day 2' ongoing impact were being phased in to regulatory capital at 25% per year. The following table summarizes the capital impact delay and phase in period on our regulatory capital from years 2020 to 2025.\n\nCapital Impact Delayed\n\nPhase In Period\n\n",

By January 1, 2024, Capital One had phased in 75% of a $2.4 billion capital addition related to this rule.

      "answer": "In 2022, American Express highlighted the Membership Rewards program as a core component of its cobrand card partnerships, noting that cobrand portfolios accounted for approximately 40% of worldwide Card Member loans as of December 31, 2021. The company made significant payments to cobrand partners based on spending and rewards earned, with these payments increasing due to competitive pressures. By 2023, the Membership Rewards program remained central to customer value but showed a shift toward dependency on third-party redemption partners, particularly Amazon and Delta, which were identified as the two largest redemption partners. This indicates a strategic evolution where American Express not only continued to rely on the program for cobrand relationships but also became more dependent on external redemption options to maintain program attractiveness, which introduced new risks around continuity and cost management.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, the Membership Rewards program was a key driver of cobrand card partnerships, with 40% of worldwide Card Member loans tied to cobrand portfolios. Payments to partners were rising due to competition.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the program's focus expanded to include increased reliance on third-party redemption partners like Amazon and Delta, signaling a shift toward external dependency to sustain program value.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects an evolution in strategic importance: from being a core partnership driver in 2022 to a broader dependency on third-party redemption ecosystems in 2023, which introduces new financial and operational risks."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe face intense competition for partner relationships, which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n\nIn the ordinary course of our business we enter into different types of contractual arrangements with business partners in a variety of industries. For example, we have partnered with Delta, Marriott, Hilton and British Airways, as well as many others globally, to offer cobranded cards for consumers and small businesses, and through our Membership Rewards program we have partnered with businesses in many industries, including Delta and others in the airline industry, to offer benefits to Card Member participants. See 'Partners and Relationships' under 'Business' for additional information on our business partnerships, including with Delta.\n\nCompetition for relationships with key business partners is very intense and there can be no assurance we will be able to grow or maintain these partner relationships or that they will remain as profitable or valued by our customers. Establishing and retaining attractive cobrand card partnerships is particularly competitive among card issuers and networks as these partnerships typically appeal to high-spending loyal customers. All of our cobrand portfolios in the aggregate accounted for approximately 19 percent of our worldwide network volumes for the year ended December 31, 2021. Card Member loans related to our cobrand portfolios accounted for approximately 40 percent of our worldwide Card Member loans as of December 31, 2021.\n\nCobrand arrangements are entered into for a fixed period, generally ranging from five to ten years, and will terminate in accordance with their terms, including at the end of the fixed period unless extended or renewed at the option of the parties, or upon early termination as a result of an event of default or otherwise. We face the risk that we could lose partner relationships, even after we have invested significant resources in the relationships. We may also choose to not renew certain cobrand relationships. Network volumes could decline and Card Member attrition could increase, in each case, significantly as a result of the termination of one or more cobrand partnership relationships. In addition, some of our cobrand arrangements provide that, upon expiration or termination, the cobrand partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the loans generated with respect to its program, which could result in the loss of the card accounts and a significant decline in our Card Member loans outstanding.\n\nWe regularly seek to extend or renew cobrand arrangements in advance of the end of the contract term and face the risk that existing relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us or that we may be unable to renegotiate on terms that are acceptable to us, as competition for such relationships continues to increase. We make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. The amount we pay to our cobrand partners has increased, particularly in the United States, and may continue to increase as arrangements are renegotiated due to increasingly intense competition for cobrand partners among card issuers and networks.\n\nThe loss of exclusivity arrangements with business partners, the loss of the partner relationship altogether (whether by non-renewal at the end of the contract period, such as the end of our relationship with Costco in the United States in 2016, or as the result of a merger, legal or regulatory action or otherwise, such as the withdrawal of American Airlines in 2014 from our Airport Club Access program for Centurion and Platinum Card Members) or the renegotiation of existing partnerships with terms that are significantly worse for us could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. See ' Our business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition' for information on the uncertainty regarding our cobrand and agent relationships in the EU and the UK. In addition, any publicity associated with the loss of any of our key business partners could harm our reputation, making it more difficult to attract and retain Card Members and merchants, and could weaken our negotiating position with our remaining and prospective business partners. \u00ae \u00ae\n\nArrangements with our business partners represent a significant portion of our business. We are exposed to risks associated with our business partners, including reputational issues, business slowdowns, bankruptcies, liquidations, restructurings and consolidations, and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners.\n\nOur success is, in many ways, dependent on the success of our partners. From customer acquisition to cobranding arrangements, from participation in our rewards programs to facilitating B2B supplier payments for our corporate clients, we rely on our business partners across many aspects of our company and our arrangements with business partners represent a significant portion of our business. Some of our partners manage certain aspects of our customer relationships, such as our OptBlue partners. To the extent any of our partners fail to effectively promote and support our products, experience a slowdown in their business, operational disruptions, reputational issues or loss of consumer confidence, or are otherwise unable to meet our expectations or those of their other stakeholders, our business may be materially negatively impacted. We face the risk that existing relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us or that we may be unable to renegotiate on terms that are acceptable to us. In addition, we may be obligated to make or accelerate payments to certain business partners such as cobrand partners upon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as a shortfall in certain performance and revenue levels. If we are not able to effectively manage these triggering events, we could unexpectedly have to make payments to these partners, which could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 12 to our 'Consolidated Financial Statements' for additional information on financial commitments related to agreements with certain cobrand partners.",

      "question": "How has the financial structure of American Express's commitments to cobrand partners evolved between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of guaranteed minimum payments and reward point valuation?",
      "answer": "In 2022, American Express reported approximately $2.6 billion in financial commitments outstanding related to agreements with cobrand partners, where minimum payments were generally satisfied through Card Members' spending and reward point accumulation over 5-10 year terms. By 2023, the company's disclosures indicated a more detailed accounting framework where payments to cobrand partners were tied directly to reward liabilities and classified under contra-revenue or expenses depending on the nature of the benefit received. This evolution reflects a shift toward more nuanced financial obligations tied to customer behavior and reward redemption patterns, rather than just fixed minimum commitments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, AXP disclosed $2.6 billion in financial commitments to cobrand partners, primarily satisfied through Card Member spending or fulfilled via reward points if spending targets were not met.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, AXP provided more granular details on how payments to cobrand partners were classified\u2014either as contra-revenue or as expenses\u2014depending on whether the company received measurable benefits, and emphasized liabilities tied to rewards earned and expected to be redeemed.",
        "Step 3: The change indicates a shift from a focus on fixed financial commitments to a more dynamic model based on customer behavior and reward redemption, suggesting a more risk-sensitive and performance-linked structure."

      "answer": "In 2022, American Express defined asset securitizations in a glossary entry, describing the mechanics of transferring loans to trusts that issue asset-backed securities, and noted that securitized loans and receivables were reported as assets while the securities were reported as liabilities. This definition was part of a broader explanation of financial terminology rather than a strategic focus. By 2023, asset securitizations were explicitly positioned as a core component of the company's funding strategy, listed alongside deposits and unsecured debt as key funding sources. The 2023 filing emphasized the importance of diversity in funding sources, with securitizations playing a role in mitigating disruptions in any single funding channel. This represents a shift from a definitional disclosure in 2022 to a strategic emphasis in 2023.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## OTHER MATTERS\n\n## RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\n\nRefer to the Recently Adopted Accounting Standards section of Note 1 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements.'\n\n## GLOSSARY OF SELECTED TERMINOLOGY\n\nAdjusted net interest income - A non-GAAP measure that represents net interest income attributable to our Card Member loans (which includes, on a GAAP basis, interest that is deemed uncollectible), excluding the impact of interest expense and interest income not attributable to our Card Member loans.\n\nAirline-related volume - Represents spend at airlines as a merchant, which is included within T&amp;E-related volume.\n\nAsset securitizations - Asset securitization involves the transfer and sale of loans or receivables to a special-purpose entity created for the securitization activity, typically a trust. The trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset-backed securities that are secured by the transferred loans and receivables. The trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the transferred loans or receivables. The securitized loans and receivables of our Lending Trust and Charge Trust (collectively, the Trusts) are reported as assets and the securities issued by the Trusts are reported as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nAverage discount rate This calculation is generally designed to reflect the average pricing at all merchants accepting American Express cards and represents the percentage of network volumes retained by us from spend at merchants we acquire, or from merchants acquired by third parties on our behalf, net of amounts retained by such third parties. The average discount rate, together with network volumes, drive our discount revenue.\n\nBilled business - Represents transaction volumes (including cash advances) on cards and other payment products issued by American Express. Billed business is reported as inside the United States or outside the United States based on the location of the issuer.\n\nCapital ratios - Represents the minimum standards established by regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient capital to absorb on- and off-balance sheet losses beyond current loss accrual estimates. Refer to the Capital Strategy section under 'Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity' for further related definitions under Basel III.\n\nCard Member - The individual holder of an issued American Express-branded card.\n\nCard Member loans - Represents revolve-eligible transactions on our card products, as well as any interest charges and associated card-related fees.\n\nCard Member receivables - Represents transactions on our card products and card related fees that need to be paid in full on or before the Card Member's payment due date.\n\nCards-in-force - Represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding by American Express (proprietary cards-in-force) and cards issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements with banks and other institutions, including joint ventures (GNS cards-in-force), except for GNS retail cobrand cards that had no out-of-store spending activity during the prior twelve months. Basic cards-in-force excludes supplemental cards issued on consumer accounts. Cards-in-force is useful in understanding the size of our Card Member base.\n\nCharge cards - Represents cards that generally carry no pre-set spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases. Each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely economics reflecting a Card Member's most recent credit information and spend patterns. Charge Card Members must pay the full amount of balances billed each month, with the exception of balances that can be revolved under lending features offered on certain charge cards, such as Pay Over Time and Plan It, that allow Card Members to pay for eligible purchases with interest over time.\n\nCobrand cards - Cards issued under cobrand agreements with selected commercial partners. Pursuant to the cobrand agreements, we make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. The partner is then liable for providing rewards to the Card Member under the cobrand partner's own loyalty program.\n\nCredit cards - Represents cards that have a range of revolving payment terms, structured payment features (e.g. Plan It), grace periods, and rate and fee structures.\n\nDiscount revenue - Primarily represents the amount earned on transactions occurring at merchants that have entered into a card acceptance agreement with us, a GNS partner or other third-party merchant acquirer, for facilitating transactions between the merchants and Card Members.",

      "question": "How has American Express's financial relationship with cobrand partners evolved between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of how rewards liabilities and business development expenses are managed?",
      "answer": "In 2022, American Express highlighted that changes in the financial condition of cobrand partners could materially affect its financial condition or results of operations, indicating a risk-based perspective on the relationship. By 2023, the company's relationship evolved into a more structured financial dependency, where cobrand partners are actively involved in the delivery of rewards under their own loyalty programs, and American Express records liabilities based on rewards earned through cobrand card spending. Additionally, business development expenses in 2023 included specific payments to cobrand partners, showing a shift from risk exposure to active cost integration and dependency.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, cobrand partners were identified as a risk factor, particularly concerning their financial condition and its potential material impact on American Express.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, cobrand partners became part of the financial operations, with American Express recording contra-revenue liabilities tied to cobrand card spending and making direct payments to these partners under business development expenses.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a shift from a risk-based relationship in 2022 to a dependency-based financial model in 2023, indicating a transformation in the nature of the relationship."
