      "answer": "In 2023, UPS expanded its cold-chain logistics capabilities through the acquisition of Bomi Group and MNX Global Logistics, aiming to enhance its healthcare logistics services. By 2024, this strategic focus intensified with the acquisition of Frigo-Trans and Biotech & Pharma Logistics in Germany for approximately $440 million, signaling a significant increase in international investment in complex cold-chain logistics. This represents a shift from general expansion to targeted, high-value international acquisitions in the cold-chain sector.",

      "answer": "In 2023, UPS reported a British Pound Sterling (GBP) hedge position of 663 million units, which decreased to 536 million units in 2024. This represents a reduction of 127 million units, or approximately 19.15%. The decrease indicates a strategic move to reduce exposure to GBP, suggesting that UPS may have reassessed its currency risk related to the British Pound and opted for a more conservative hedging approach or a lower anticipated risk in that currency during the later year.",

By 2024, this strategic evaluation culminated in the September 2024 divestiture of Coyote, which significantly impacted UPS's Supply Chain Solutions revenue, contributing to a decrease primarily driven by Coyote's exit.

These reductions were partially offset by growth in Logistics and certain of our other businesses.\n\nWithin our Logistics businesses revenue increased $510 million. The acquisition of MNX Global Logistics in the fourth quarter of 2023 contributed $303 million of the increase, including revenue related to healthcare customers. Revenue in mail services increased $206 million driven by new customer volume and rate increases in the second half of the year. We expect continued growth within our Logistics businesses in 2025, driven by expected growth from our healthcare customers.\n\nWithin our Forwarding businesses, revenue decreased $806 million. Revenue from Coyote decreased $976 million due to lower volumes, continued softness in market rates, and the completion of the divestiture. International airfreight revenue increased $52 million, primarily due to increases in market rates. V olume also grew during the year, particularly on the Asia ex port lanes, driven by growth from e-commerce customers. We expect revenue growth to continue during 2025, driven by improving customer mix. Ocean freight forwarding revenue also increased, driven by an increase in market rates resulting from improved market dynamics as the year progressed, which more than offset lower volumes during the year. We expect revenue growth to continue into 2025 driven by these higher rates.\n\nRevenue from our other businesses within Supply Chain Solutions increased. In our digital businesses, revenue increased $163 million, driven by volume growth at Roadie and the full-year impact of Happy Returns, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2023.",

      "answer": "In 2023, UPS described using a bond matching approach to select specific bonds that would satisfy projected benefit payments, emphasizing its belief that this method reflects the process they would employ to settle pension and postretirement obligations. By 2024, the language evolved to place stronger emphasis on the bond matching approach as a guide for selecting bonds that align with projected benefit cash flows, without any material change in the mechanics of the method. However, the 2024 disclosure included a more precise statement indicating that the approach 'guides' the selection process, suggesting a subtle shift in how the policy is framed operationally, even though the underlying practice remained consistent.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n- or more of our reporting units. The projections that we use in our DCF model are updated annually, or more often if necessary, and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units.\n- The market approach uses observable market data of comparable public companies to estimate fair value utilizing financial metrics (such as enterprise value to net sales). We apply judgment to select appropriate comparison companies based on the business operations, size and operating results of our reporting units. Changes to our selection of comparable companies or market multiples may result in changes to the estimates of fair value of our reporting units.\n\nIn 2024, we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing using both qualitative and quantitative methods. As of our July 1 testing date, we concluded the fair value of each reporting unit ex ceeded its carrying value; however, three reporting units (Roadie, G lobal Freight Forwarding, and Global Logistics and Distribution) exhibited limited ex cess of fair value and thus reflect a greater risk of impairment occurring in future periods. Approx imately $1.1 billion of our consolidated goodwill balance of $4.3 billion is represented by these three reporting units.\n\nIn addition to forecasted and actual business performance, our valuation estimates are most sensitive to changes in cost of capital. For the reporting units we have identified as having limited cushion above, if the cost of capital were increased by 100 basis points or our projected cash flows were reduced by 10 percent, it is reasonably possible that these reporting units would be impaired. We believe the fair values of our Roadie, Global Freight Forwarding, and Global Logistics and Distribution reporting units continue to exceed their respective carrying values. However, if the businesses do not meet forecasts or cost of capital requirements increase, we may incur future impairment charges. We continue to monitor all of our reporting units between annual testing dates.\n\nWe did not record any goodwill impairments during 2024. During 2023, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $56 million related to Roadie and $61 million related to Delivery Solutions. The Delivery Solutions impairment represented all of the goodwill associated with this reporting unit. These charges are included within Other expenses in the statement of consolidated income. We did not incur any goodwill impairment charges in 2022.\n\nOur finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. These assets are tested for impairment as part of asset groups that may include other long-lived assets. See \"Critical Accounting Estimates - Depreciation, Residual Value and Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment\" for a discussion of estimates impacting asset groups. In addition, a reduction in expected useful life, or a decision to sell or abandon an intangible asset before the end of its useful life, may increase amortization expense, which could have a material impact on our results of operations. As a result of our strategic actions under our Efficiency Reimagined initiatives, we are reviewing our software application infrastructure and ex pect that as result of this review, it is reasonably possible that revisions to the useful lives of certain finite-lived intangible assets will occur in future periods. See note 7 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for a discussion of finitelived intangible asset impairments.\n\n## Self-Insurance Accruals\n\nWe base self-insurance reserves on actuarial estimates, which are determined with the assistance of a third-party actuary through a complex process that includes the application of various actuarial methods and assumptions. The process incorporates actual loss experience and judgments about expected future development based on historical experience, recent and projected trends in claim frequency and severity, changes in the level of risk retained under our programs and changes in claims handling practices, among other factors.\n\nWorkers' compensation, automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take a number of years to resolve. Consequently, actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to resolve a claim. Several factors can affect the actual cost, or severity, of a claim, including:\n\n- Risk retention limits;\n- Length of time a claim remains open;\n- Trends in healthcare and litigation costs;\n- Results of any related litigation; and\n- Changes in legislation.",

The  increase  was  primarily attributable to higher product costs of approximately $560 million at RMS due to higher production volume on various Sikorsky helicopter programs and for TLS programs due to the delivery of an international pilot training system; $435 million at Aeronautics due to higher volume on classified contracts and F-16 production contracts, partially offset by lower volume on F-35 development contracts; $345 million at MFC due to higher volume on PAC-3, LRASM and JASSM programs; partially offset by lower product costs of approximately $65 million at Space due to the renationalization of AWE, partially offset by higher volume on hypersonic development, Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) and Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next Gen OPIR) programs.\n\n## Service Costs\n\nService  costs  increased  approximately  $92  million,  or  1%,  in  2021  compared  to  2020.  The  increase  in  service  costs  was primarily  due  to  higher  service  costs  of  approximately  $85  million  at Aeronautics  due  to  higher  sustainment  volume  on  F-35, partially offset by lower sustainment volume on F-22.\n\n## Severance and Restructuring Charges\n\nDuring  2021,  we  recorded  severance  and  restructuring  charges  of  $36  million  ($28  million,  or  $0.10  per  share,  after-tax) associated  with  plans  to  close  and  consolidate  certain  facilities  and  reduce  total  workforce  within  our  RMS  business  segment. During 2020, we recorded severance charges totaling $27 million ($21 million, or $0.08 per share, after-tax) related to the planned elimination of certain positions primarily at our corporate functions.\n\n## Other Unallocated, Net\n\nOther unallocated, net primarily includes the FAS/CAS operating adjustment (which represents the difference between CAS pension cost recorded in our business segments' results of operations and the service cost component of FAS pension (expense) income), stock-based compensation expense and other corporate costs. These items are not allocated to the business segments and, therefore, are not allocated to cost of sales for products or services. Other unallocated, net reduced cost of sales by $1.8 billion in 2021,  compared  to  $1.7  billion  in  2020.  Other  unallocated,  net  during  2021  was  higher  primarily  due  to  an  increase  in  our FAS/CAS operating adjustment and fluctuations in costs associated with various corporate items, none of which were individually significant.  See  'Business  Segment  Results  of  Operations'  and  'Critical  Accounting  Policies  -  Postretirement  Benefit  Plans' discussion below for more information on our pension cost.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nOther income (expense), net generally includes earnings generated by equity method investees. Other income, net in 2021 was $62 million, compared to other expense, net of $10 million in 2020. Other income, net in 2021 included lower earnings generated by  equity  method  investments;  however,  other  expense,  net  in  2020  included  a  noncash  impairment  charge  of  $128  million ($96  million ,  or $0.34  per  share,  after-tax)  related  to  our  previous  investment  in Advanced  Military  Maintenance,  Repair  and Overhaul Center (AMMROC), which was sold in 2020. See 'Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Interest Expense\n\nInterest  expense  in  2021  was  $569  million,  compared  to  $591  million  in  2020.  The  decrease  in  interest  expense  in  2021 resulted primarily from our scheduled repayment of debt in October 2020 and September 2021 of $500 million each. See 'Capital Structure, Resources and Other' included within 'Liquidity and Cash Flows' discussion below and 'Note 11 - Debt' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our debt.\n\n## Non-Service FAS Pension (Expense) Income\n\nNon-service FAS pension expense was $1.3 billion in 2021, compared to income of $219 million in 2020. Non-service FAS pension expense in 2021 includes a noncash pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion ($1.3 billion, or $4.72 per share, after-tax), related  to  the  transfer  of  $4.9  billion  of  our  gross  defined  benefit  pension  obligations  and  related  plan  assets  to  an  insurance company.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nWe maintain active relationships with a broad and diverse group of U.S. and international financial institutions. We believe that they provide us with sufficient access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct our business. We continue to closely monitor  the  financial  market  environment  and  actively  manage  counterparty  exposure  to  minimize  the  potential  impact  from adverse developments with any single credit provider while ensuring availability of, and access to, sufficient credit resources.\n\nOur main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market prices on certain equity securities.  Our  financial  instruments  that  are  subject  to  interest  rate  risk  principally  include  fixed-rate  long-term  debt  and commercial paper, if issued. The estimated fair value of our outstanding debt was $15.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and the outstanding principal amount was $12.8 billion, excluding unamortized discounts and issuance costs of $1.1 billion. A 10% change in the level of interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our outstanding debt at December 31, 2021.\n\nWe use derivative instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We do not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. We transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the British pound sterling, the euro, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Norwegian Kroner and the Polish Zloty. These contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges.  We  also  are  exposed  to  the  impact  of  interest  rate  changes  primarily  through  our  borrowing  activities.  For  fixed  rate borrowings, we may use variable interest rate swaps, effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings in order to hedge changes in the fair value of the debt. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges. For variable rate borrowings, we may use fixed interest rate swaps, effectively converting variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on earnings. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. We also may enter into derivative instruments  that  are  not  designated  as  hedges  and  do  not  qualify  for  hedge  accounting,  which  are  intended  to  mitigate  certain economic exposures.\n\nThe classification of gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of derivatives is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation. Adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives attributable to highly effective hedges are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustments to the hedged items or reflected net of income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are not highly effective, if any, are immediately recognized in earnings. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $500 million and $572 million. The aggregate notional amount  of  our  outstanding  foreign  currency  hedges  at  December  31,  2021  and  2020  was  $4.0  billion  and  $3.4  billion.  At December  31,  2021  and  2020,  the  net  fair  value  of  our  derivative  instruments  was  not  material  (see  'Note  16  -  Fair  Value Measurements' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). A 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement of our foreign currency contracts would not have a material impact on the aggregate net fair value of such contracts or our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, as we enter into foreign currency contracts to hedge foreign currency exposure on underlying transactions  we  believe  that  any  movement  on  our  foreign  currency  contracts  would  be  offset  by  movement  on  the  underlying transactions and, therefore, when taken together do not create material risk.\n\nWe evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have acceptable credit risk at the time the agreements are executed. Our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across several banks. We periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit  exposure  to  individual  counterparties. We  do  not  hold  or  issue  derivative  financial  instruments  for  trading  or  speculative purposes.\n\nWe maintain a separate trust that includes investments to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. As of December 31, 2021, investments in the trust totaled $2.1 billion and are reflected at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet in other noncurrent assets. The trust holds investments in marketable equity securities and fixed-income securities that are exposed to price changes and changes in interest rates. A portion of the liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plans supported by the trust is also impacted by changes in the market price of our common stock and certain market indices. Changes in the value of the liabilities have the effect of partially offsetting the impact of changes in the value of the trust. Both the change in the fair value of  the  trust  and  the  change  in  the  value  of  the  liabilities  are  recognized  on  our  consolidated  statements  of  earnings  in  other unallocated, net and were not material for the year ended December 31, 2021.",

The increase was primarily attributable to higher operating profit of approximately $140 million for Sikorsky helicopter programs due to higher risk retirements (Black Hawk and CH-53K), higher production volume (Black Hawk and CRH), and lower charges on the CRH program in the first half of 2021; and about $10 million for TLS programs due to the delivery of an international pilot training system in the first quarter of 2021. Operating profit for IWSS programs was comparable as lower risk retirements on the LCS program and lower volume on the TPQ53 program were offset by higher volume on the CSC program and lower charges on a ground-based radar program. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were $80 million higher in 2021 compared 2020.",

The  increase  was  primarily  attributable  to  higher  product  sales  of  approx imately $1.4 billion at MFC, $1.1 billion at RMS and $840 million at Aeronautics. Higher product sales at MFC were due to production ramp up on GMLRS, HIMARS, JASSM and LRASM programs. Higher product sales at RMS were primarily due to higher volume on radar programs, new program ramp up within the laser systems portfolio and higher production volume on CH-53K program, partially offset by lower volume on the VH-92A program. Higher product sales at Aeronautics were due to higher volume on F-35 production contracts.\n\n## Service Sales\n\nService sales increased $460 million, or 4%, in 2024 as compared to 2023.  The increase in service sales was primarily due to higher sales of approximately $305 million at Aeronautics and $150 million at Space. Higher service sales at Aeronautics were due to higher volume on F-35 sustainment contracts. Higher service sales at Space were due to higher volume on national security space services.\n\n## Cost of Sales\n\nCost of sales, for both products and services, consist of materials, labor, subcontracting costs and an allocation of indirect costs (overhead and general and administrative), as well as the costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers. For each of our contracts, we monitor the nature and amount of costs at the contract level, which form the basis for estimating our total costs to complete the contract.

      "answer": "In 2022, Lockheed Martin's involvement in hypersonics programs was described as a key growth area that was dependent on U.S. Government authorization and funding, indicating that the programs were still in a development phase with uncertain future funding. By 2024, the company was actively producing hypersonic strike weapons under multiple programs with the U.S. Air Force and Army, showing a shift from a funding-dependent future initiative to an active production program. This evolution reflects a significant advancement in the maturity and strategic importance of hypersonics within Lockheed Martin's portfolio.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nsubsequent events, changed circumstances, changes in expectations, or the estimates and assumptions associated with them. The forward-looking  statements  in  this  Form  10-K  are  intended  to  be  subject  to  the  safe  harbor  protection  provided  by  the  federal securities laws.\n\n## ITEM  1A.    Risk Factors\n\nAn  investment  in  our  common  stock  or  debt  securities  involves  risks  and  uncertainties.  We  seek  to  identify,  manage  and mitigate risks to our business, but risk and uncertainty cannot be eliminated or necessarily predicted. The outcome of one or more of these risks could have a material effect on our operating results, financial position, or cash flows. You should carefully consider the  following  factors,  in  addition  to  the  other  information  contained  in  this Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K,  before  deciding  to purchase our common stock or debt securities.\n\n## Risks Related to our Reliance on Government Contracts\n\nWe  depend  heavily  on  contracts  with  the  U.S.  Government  for  a  substantial  portion  of  our  business.  Changes  in  the  U.S. Government's priorities, or delays or reductions in spending could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe derived 71% of our total consolidated net sales from the U.S. Government in 2021, including 62% from the DoD. We expect  to  continue  to  derive  most  of  our  sales  from  work  performed  under  U.S.  Government  contracts.  Those  contracts  are conditioned upon the continuing availability of Congressional appropriations. Congress usually appropriates funds on a fiscal year (FY)  basis  even  though  contract  performance  may  extend  over  many  years.  Consequently,  contracts  are  often  partially  funded initially and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations over time. If we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on a contract or in advance of a contract award, we may be at risk of not being reimbursed for those costs unless and until additional funds are obligated under the contract or the contract is awarded and funded.\n\nBudget  uncertainty,  the  risk  of  future  budget  cuts,  the  potential  for  U.S.  Government  shutdowns,  the  use  of  continuing resolutions, and the federal debt ceiling can adversely affect our industry and the funding for our programs. If appropriations were delayed or a government shutdown were to occur and were to continue for an extended period of time, we could be at risk of program cancellations and other disruptions and nonpayment. When the U.S. Government operates under a continuing resolution, new contract  and  program  starts  are  restricted  and  funding  for  our  programs  may  be  unavailable,  reduced  or  delayed.  Shifting funding priorities  or  federal  budget  compromises,  could  also  result  in  reductions  in  overall  defense  spending  on  an  absolute  or inflation-adjusted basis, which could adversely impact our business. Our business could also be adversely impacted by reductions or delays in spending by non-U.S. government customers who are facing budget pressures.\n\nWe believe our diverse range of products and services generally make it less likely that cuts in any specific contract or program will  affect  our  business  on  a  long-term  basis.  However,  termination  of  multiple  or  large  programs  or  contracts  could  adversely affect  our  business  and  future  financial  performance.  Changes  in  funding  priorities  could  also  reduce  opportunities  in  existing programs and in future programs where we intend to compete. While we would expect to compete and be well positioned as the incumbent  on  existing  programs,  we  may  not  be  successful  and,  even  if  we  are  successful,  the  replacement  programs  may  be funded at lower levels. In addition, our ability to grow in key areas such as hypersonics programs, classified programs and nextgeneration franchise programs will also be affected by the overall budget environment, whether development programs transition to production and the timing of such transition, all of which are dependent on U.S. Government authorization and funding.\n\nThe F-35 program comprises a material portion of our revenue and reductions in funding for this program and risks related to the development, production, sustainment, performance, schedule, cost and requirements of the program could adversely affect our performance.\n\nThe F-35 program, which consists of multiple development, production and sustainment contracts, is our largest program and represented  27%  of  our  total  consolidated  net  sales  in  2021. A  decision  by  the  U.S.  Government  or  other  governments  to  cut spending  on  this  program  or  reduce  or  delay  planned  orders  would  have  an  adverse  impact  on  our  business  and  results  of operations. Given the size and complexity of the F-35 program, we anticipate that there will be continual reviews related to aircraft performance, program schedule, cost, and requirements as part of the DoD, Congressional, and international countries' oversight and  budgeting  processes.  Current  program  challenges  include  supplier,  Lockheed  Martin  and  partner  performance  (including COVID-19 performance-related challenges), software development, the receipt of funding for contracts on a timely basis, execution of  future  flight  tests  and  findings  resulting  from  testing  and  operating  the  aircraft,  the  level  of  cost  associated  with  life  cycle operations, sustainment and potential contractual obligations, and the ability to continue to reduce the unit production costs and improve affordability.",

      "question": "How has the nature of Customer Demand Volatility as a risk factor for Caterpillar evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in relation to its impact on financial performance and supply chain stability?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Customer Demand Volatility was described as being primarily driven by economic uncertainties, including the lingering effects of a global pandemic, which led to inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, and labor inefficiencies, all of which limited Caterpillar's ability to meet customer demand. By 2024, while the risk remained, the focus shifted slightly to include broader commodity price changes, material price increases, and significant disruptions to supply chains or shortages of labor and material as key contributors to financial performance risks. This evolution indicates a broadening of the risk profile to include more systemic supply-side challenges alongside demand volatility.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2023, the document highlights that pandemics significantly increased economic and customer demand uncertainty, caused inflationary pressure, and led to volatility in customer demand and supply chain disruptions.",
        "In 2024, the document expands the risk to include commodity price changes, material price increases, and significant disruptions to supply chains or shortages of labor and material as potential adverse impacts on financial results and customer commitments.",
        "The change reflects a shift from primarily demand-side volatility driven by external shocks (e.g., pandemics) to a more integrated risk that includes both demand and supply-side volatility, indicating a more complex and systemic exposure for Caterpillar."

It is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and, as a result, you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.\n\n## MACROECONOMIC RISKS\n\n## Our business and the industries we serve are highly sensitive to global and regional economic conditions.\n\nOur results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions globally and regionally and in the particular industries we serve.  The demand for our products and services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in periods of economic weakness characterized by lower levels of government and business  investment,  lower  levels  of  business  confidence,  lower  corporate  earnings,  high  real  interest  rates,  lower  credit  activity  or  tighter  credit  conditions, perceived or  actual  industry  overcapacity,  higher  unemployment  and  lower  consumer  spending. A  prolonged  period  of  economic  weakness  may  also  result  in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges.  Economic conditions vary across regions and countries, and demand for our products and services generally increases in those regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment.  Slower economic growth or a change in the global mix of regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe energy, transportation, and mining industries are significant adopters of Caterpillar products. In these industries customers are likely to base their purchase decisions upon expected future commodity dynamics, including price. Commodity price volatility may be abrupt and unpredictable in response to global economic conditions,  government  actions,  regulatory  changes,  supply/demand  dynamics,  innovation,  and  commodity  substitutions  among  others.  Economic  conditions affecting the industries we serve may reduce capital expenditures in response to a variety of the aforementioned conditions. Reduction in these capital expenditures may lead to decreased demand for Caterpillar products and services as well as aftermarket parts as customers may choose to extend preventative maintenance and delay overhauls when possible.\n\nThe rates of infrastructure spending, commercial construction and housing starts also play a significant role in our results.  Our products are an integral component of these activities, and as these activities decrease, demand for our products and services may be significantly impacted, which could negatively impact our results.\n\n## Catastrophic events could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\n\nThe occurrence  of  a  major  earthquake,  fire,  flood,  tsunami  or  other  weather  event,  power  loss,  telecommunications  failure,  software  or  hardware  malfunctions, pandemics, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event that our disaster recovery plans do not adequately address, could adversely affect our employees, our systems, our ability to produce and distribute our products, and our reputation. Pandemics can have a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response. Such measures could include travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders and shutdowns. Those measures could impact all or portions of our workforce and operations and the operations of our customers, dealers and suppliers. Material and component shortages, logistics constraints and labor inefficiencies could limit our ability to meet customer demand, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\n\nThese catastrophic events can significantly increase economic and customer demand uncertainty, cause inflationary pressure in the U.S. and elsewhere and lead to volatility in customer demand for the Company's products and services and cause supply chain disruptions. Economic uncertainties could affect customer demand for the Company's products and services, the value of the equipment financed or leased, the demand for financing and the financial condition and credit risk of our dealers and customers.\n\nA catastrophic event resulting in the destruction or disruption of our workforce, our systems, our ability to produce and distribute our products, any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could adversely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and our operating results or cash flows. The adverse effects of any such catastrophic event would be exacerbated if experienced at the same time as another unexpected and adverse event.\n\nCommodity  price  changes,  material  price  increases,  fluctuations  in  demand  for  our  products  and  serv ices,  significant  disruptions  to  our  supply  chains  or significant shortages of labor and material may adversely impact our financial results or our ability to meet commitments to customers.\n\nWe are a significant user of steel and many other commodities required for the manufacture of our products. Increases in the prices of such commodities would increase our costs, negatively impacting our business, results of operations and financial",

      "answer": "In 2023, FG Wilson's electric power generation systems were distributed through a network of 110 distributors covering 109 countries. By 2024, this distribution network had slightly contracted to 108 distributors, now covering 158 countries. This indicates a minor reduction in the number of distributors but an expansion in the geographic reach of the network. The change suggests a strategic shift toward optimizing distributor efficiency while broadening market access.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, FG Wilson's distribution network consisted of 110 distributors covering 109 countries.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the network slightly decreased to 108 distributors but expanded to cover 158 countries.",
        "Step 3: The change represents a transformation in the structure and geographic strategy of the distribution network, with fewer distributors managing broader regional coverage."

Nature of operations\n\nInformation in our financial statements and related commentary are presented in the following categories:\n\nMachinery,  E nergy  &amp;  Transportation (ME&amp;T)  -  We  define  ME&amp;T  as  Caterpillar  Inc.  and  its  subsidiaries,  ex cluding  Financial  Products.  ME&amp;T's information relates to the design, manufacturing and marketing of our products.\n\nFinancial  Products -  We  define  Financial  Products  as  our  finance  and  insurance  subsidiaries,  primarily  Caterpillar  Financial  Services  Corporation  (Cat Financial) and Caterpillar Insurance Holdings Inc. (Insurance Services). Financial Products' information relates to the financing to customers and dealers for the purchase and lease of Caterpillar and other equipment.\n\nWe sell our products primarily under the brands 'Caterpillar,' 'CAT,' design versions of 'CAT' and 'Caterpillar,' 'EMD,' 'FG  Wilson,' 'MWM,' 'Perkins,' 'Progress Rail,' 'SEM' and 'Solar Turbines.'\n\nWe conduct operations in our ME&amp;T line of business under highly competitive conditions, including intense price competition. We place great emphasis on the high quality and performance of our products and our dealers' service support. Although no one competitor is believed to produce all of the same types of equipment that we do, there are numerous companies, large and small, which compete with us in the sale of each of our products.\n\nWe distribute our machines principally through a worldwide organization of dealers (dealer network), 41 located in the United States and 111 located outside the United States, serving 187 countries.  We sell reciprocating engines principally through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in products. We also sell some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by our subsidiary Perkins Engines Company Limited through its worldwide network of 88 distributors covering 185  countries. We sell  the  FG   Wilson  branded  electric  power  generation  systems  through  its  worldwide  network  of 108  distributors  covering 158 countries.  Our dealers do not deal exclusively with our products; however, in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers' principal business. We sell some products, primarily turbines and locomotives, to end customers through sales forces employed by the company. At times, these employees are assisted by independent sales representatives.\n\nThe Financial Products line of business also conducts operations under highly competitive conditions. Financing for users of Caterpillar products is available through a variety of competitive sources, principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies.  We offer various financing, insurance and risk management products designed to support sales of our products and generate financing income for our company. We conduct a significant portion of Financial Products activity in North America, with additional offices in Latin America, Asia/Pacific, Europe and Africa.\n\n## B. Basis of presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries where we have a controlling financial interest.\n\nInvestments in companies where our ownership exceeds 20 percent and we do not have a controlling interest or where the ownership is less than 20 percent and for which we have a significant influence are accounted for by the equity method.\n\nWe consolidate all variable interest entities (V IEs) where Caterpillar Inc. is the primary beneficiary.  The primary beneficiary of a V IE is the party that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the V IE. See Note 21 for further discussion on a consolidated VIE.\n\nCat Financial has end-user customers and dealers that are VIEs of which we are not the primary beneficiary. Our maximum exposure to loss from our involvement with these VIEs is limited to the credit risk inherently present in the financial support that we have provided. Credit risk was evaluated and reflected in our financial statements as part of our overall portfolio of finance receivables and related allowance for credit losses.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Caterpillar's involvement in diesel-electric locomotives was described as part of its broader ME&T segment, which included responsibilities such as remanufacturing Caterpillar reciprocating engines and components, as well as providing product support for on-highway vocational trucks in North America. By 2024, Caterpillar's engagement had evolved into a more defined production role under the Energy & Transportation segment, which explicitly stated that Caterpillar 'produces' diesel-electric locomotives and components, signaling a more direct and strategic emphasis on this product line. Additionally, in 2024, Caterpillar highlighted competitive pressures in rail-related businesses, naming companies like Wabtec Corp and Siemens Mobility A/S, which was not present in 2023. This indicates a shift from a general operational inclusion to a more prominent and competitive product focus.",

The product and services portfolio includes reciprocating engines, generator sets, integrated systems and solutions, turbines and turbine-related services, electrified powertrain  and  zero-emission  power  sources  and  service  solutions  development,  the  remanufacturing  of  Caterpillar  engines  and  components,  remanufacturing services for other companies, diesel-electric locomotives and other rail-related products and services as well as product support of on-highway engines.\n\nRegulatory emissions standards require us to continue to make investments as new products and new regulations are introduced. Ongoing compliance with these regulations remains a focus. Emissions compliance in developing markets is complex due to rapidly evolving and unique requirements where enforcement processes can often vary. We employ robust product development, manufacturing processes and testing to help us comply with these regulations.\n\nThe competitive environment for reciprocating engines in marine, oil and gas, industrial and electric power generation systems along with turbines in oil and gas and electric power generation consists of a few larger global competitors that compete in a variety of markets that Caterpillar serves, and a substantial number of smaller companies that compete in a limited-size product range, geographic region and/or application. Principal global competitors include Cummins Inc., Deutz AG , RollsRoyce Power Systems AG and Siemens Energy AG. Other competitors, such as V olvo Penta AB, FPT Industrial SpA (Iveco G roup), INNIO G roup, GE V ernova Inc., Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd., MAN Energy Solutions SE (VW), Weichai Power Co., Ltd., and other emerging market competitors compete in certain markets in which Caterpillar competes. An additional set of competitors, including Aggreko plc, G enerac Holdings Inc., Rehlko Energy, Baker Hughes Co., and others, are primarily packagers who source engines and/or other components from domestic and international suppliers and market products regionally and internationally through a variety  of  distribution  channels. In rail-related businesses, our global competitors include Wabtec Corp, G reenbrier Companies, Inc., V oestalpine AG , Vossloh AG, Alstom SA, and Siemens Mobility A/S. We also compete with other companies on a more limited range of products, services and/or geographic regions.\n\nThe Energy &amp; Transportation portfolio includes the following products and related parts:\n\n- Reciprocating engine powered generator sets\n- Reciprocating engines, drivetrain and integrated systems and solutions supplied to the industrial industry as well as Caterpillar machinery\n- Integrated systems and solutions used in the electric power generation industry\n- Turbines, centrifugal gas compressors and related services\n- Reciprocating engines, drivetrain and integrated systems and solutions for the marine and oil and gas industries\n- Diesel-electric locomotives and components and other rail-related products and services\n\n## Financial Products Segment\n\nThe business of our Financial Products Segment is primarily conducted by Cat Financial, Insurance Services and their respective subsidiaries and affiliates.  Cat Financial is a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc., and it provides retail and wholesale financing alternatives to customers and dealers around the world for Caterpillar products and services, as well as financing for power generation facilities that, in most cases, incorporate Caterpillar products. Retail financing is primarily comprised of installment sale contracts and other equipment-related loans, working capital loans, finance leases, operating leases, and revolving charge accounts.  Wholesale  financing  to  Caterpillar  dealers  consists  primarily  of  inventory  and  rental  fleet  financing. In  addition,  Cat  Financial  purchases  short-term wholesale trade receivables from Caterpillar.

      "question": "How did the valuation methodology and composition of GD's Retirement Annuity Contracts change between 2022 and 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's approach to reporting these assets?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GD reported Retirement Annuity Contracts as part of Level 3 assets with a fair value of $35 million as of December 31, 2021, and this value remained relatively stable through December 31, 2020 at $38 million. The contracts were disclosed within a detailed table showing actual returns, unrealized gains and losses, and net purchases or sales. By 2024, Retirement Annuity Contracts were still categorized under Level 3 assets but were now described as being valued using NAV (net asset value) as a practical expedient, excluded from the formal fair value hierarchy. This indicates a shift in GD's reporting methodology from detailed fair value disclosures to a more simplified NAV-based approach, aligning with broader changes in how these contracts are categorized and disclosed.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Retirement Annuity Contracts were explicitly reported as Level 3 assets with specific dollar values and performance metrics.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, Retirement Annuity Contracts were still classified as Level 3 but were now reported using NAV as a practical expedient and excluded from the formal fair value hierarchy.",
        "Step 3: The change indicates a shift in valuation methodology and disclosure approach, moving from detailed fair value reporting to a simplified NAV-based treatment."

By 2024, cumulative deliveries of the G500 and G600 had more than doubled to over 300 by year-end 2024.

As a result, the G500 and G600 are faster, more fuel efficient and have greater cabin volume, more range and improved flight controls compared with the aircraft they are replacing. At year-end 2021, cumulative deliveries for these aircraft totaled almost 150.\n\nThe next model to join the Gulfstream lineup is the ultra-long-range, ultra-large-cabin G700. It combines our  most  spacious  cabin  with  our  advanced  Symmetry  Flight  Deck,  the  industry's  most  technologically advanced  flight  deck,  which  we  launched  on  our  G500  and  G600  aircraft,  and  the  superior  high-speed performance of all-new engines to create best-in-class capabilities. Gulfstream is in the process of flight testing and certification of the G700, which currently has over 2,200 test hours. We expect the G700 to enter service in the fourth quarter of 2022 pending certification from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).\n\nIn  October 2021, we introduced two new aircraft, the ultra-long-range, ultra-large-cabin G800 and largecabin G400, completing a nearly two-decade effort to develop an all-new family of Gulfstream aircraft. Both aircraft combine our industry-leading high-speed range and efficiency, safety enhancements, and our advanced Symmetry Flight Deck. The G800 is Gulfstream's longest-range aircraft, with an 8,000 nautical mile range at Mach 0.85, and it is expected to enter service in 2023 pending FAA certification. The G400 is a clean-sheet design developed in concert with the G500 and G600, thus expanding the commonality across the Gulfstream family of aircraft. Expected to enter service in 2025 pending FAA certification, the G400 will join a market segment in which Gulfstream has not participated for several decades.\n\nThe  ultra-long-range,  ultra-large-cabin  G650  and  G650ER  continue  to  generate  significant  customer interest,  with  more  than  470  aircraft  of  this  family  currently  operating  in  50  countries.  Since  the  first  G650 entered service in December 2012, its capabilities and reliability have led to significant sales and expansion of our  installed  base  around  the  globe.  Gulfstream's  current  product  line  holds  more  than  270  city-pair  speed records,  more  than  any  other  business  jet  manufacturer,  led  by  the  G650ER,  which  holds  the  National Aeronautic Association's polar and westbound around-the-world speed records.\n\nOur disciplined and consistent approach to new product development has allowed us to introduce repeatedly first-to-market  capabilities  that  set  industry  standards  for  safety,  performance,  quality,  speed  and  comfort. Product  enhancement  and  development  efforts  include  initiatives  in  advanced  avionics,  composites,  flightcontrol and vision systems, acoustics, and cabin technologies.\n\nGulfstream  designs,  develops  and  manufactures  aircraft  in  Savannah,  Georgia,  including  all  large-cabin models. The mid-cabin G280 is assembled by a non-U.S. partner. All models are outfitted in Gulfstream's U.S. facilities.

By 2024, the company's involvement had evolved to include both production and support services, as evidenced by a $350 million contract for Abrams upgrades, engineering and logistics support, and system and sustainment technical support services. Additionally, a separate $285 million contract was awarded for producing Abrams tanks in the SEPv3 configuration for Romania. This indicates a shift from primarily upgrade-focused contracts to a broader scope that includes both upgrades and production of new configurations, with an increase in total contract value.",

As  a  government  contractor,  we  are  subject  to  U.S.  government  audits  and investigations  relating  to  our  operations,  including  claims  for  fines,  penalties,  and  compensatory  and  treble damages.  We  believe  the  outcome  of  such  ongoing  government  audits  and  investigations  will  not  have  a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\nIn  the  performance  of  our  contracts,  we  routinely  request  contract  modifications  that  require  additional funding from the customer. Most often, these requests are due to customer-directed changes in the scope of work. While we are entitled to recovery of these costs under our contracts, the administrative process with our customer may be protracted. Based on the circumstances, we periodically file requests for equitable adjustment (REAs) that are sometimes converted into claims. In some cases, these requests are disputed by our customer. We believe our outstanding modifications, REAs and other claims will be resolved without material impact to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\nLetters  of  Credit  and  Guarantees. In  the  ordinary  course  of  business,  we  have  entered  into  letters  of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other similar arrangements with financial institutions and insurance carriers totaling approximately $1.2 billion on December 31, 2021. In addition, from time to time and in the ordinary course of business, we contractually guarantee the payment or performance of our subsidiaries arising under certain contracts.\n\nAircraft Trade-ins. In connection with orders for new aircraft in contract backlog, our Aerospace segment has outstanding options with some customers to trade in aircraft as partial consideration in their new-aircraft transaction. These trade-in commitments are generally structured to establish the fair market value of the tradein aircraft at a date generally 45 or fewer days preceding delivery of the new aircraft to the customer. At that time, the customer is required to either exercise the option or allow its expiration. Other trade-in commitments are structured to guarantee a pre-determined trade-in value. These commitments present more risk in the event of an adverse change in market conditions. In either case, any excess of the pre-established trade-in price above the fair market value at the time the new aircraft is delivered is treated as a reduction of revenue in the newaircraft sales transaction. As of December 31, 2021, the estimated change in fair market values from the date of the commitments was not material.\n\nLabor Agreements. On December 31, 2021, approximately one-fifth of the employees of our subsidiaries were working under collectively bargained terms and conditions, including 62 collective agreements that we have negotiated directly with unions and works councils. A number of these agreements expire within any given year.  Historically,  we  have  been  successful  at  renegotiating  these  labor  agreements  without  any  material disruption  of  operating  activities.  In  2022,  we  expect  to  negotiate  the  terms  of  21  agreements  covering approximately  3,000  employees.  We  do  not  expect  the  renegotiations  will,  either  individually  or  in  the aggregate, have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\nProduct Warranties. We provide warranties  to  our  customers  associated  with  certain  product  sales.  We record estimated warranty costs in the period in which the related products are delivered. The warranty liability recorded at each balance sheet date is based generally on the number of months of warranty coverage remaining for the products delivered and the average historical monthly warranty payments. Warranty obligations incurred in connection with long-term production contracts are accounted for within the contract estimates at completion. Our other warranty obligations, primarily for business jet aircraft, are included in other current and noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.",

      "question": "How has the G600 aircraft's role in Gulfstream's product lineup evolved from 2022 to 2023, particularly in terms of its performance metrics and production status?",
      "answer": "In 2022, the G600 was described as a recent addition to the Gulfstream fleet, having entered service in 2019, and was positioned as a clean-sheet aircraft replacing the G550. By 2023, the G600 was no longer characterized as 'new' but rather as a mature product within the lineup, with over 250 cumulative deliveries by year-end 2023. Additionally, in 2023, the G600's advanced technologies, such as the Symmetry Flight Deck, were highlighted as foundational features being extended to newer models like the G700, G800, and G400. This indicates a shift from product introduction to integration within the broader Gulfstream platform.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, the G600 is described as having entered service in 2019, replacing the G550, with emphasis on its new wing, avionics, and interior design.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the G600 is referenced as part of the established lineup, with over 250 deliveries by 2023, and its technologies (Symmetry Flight Deck) now serving as a foundation for newer aircraft.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a transition from being a newly introduced product to a core, mature product within the Gulfstream family, with its technologies becoming standardized across the fleet."

As a result, since we acquired Gulfstream over 20 years ago, we have made significant investments in research and development (R&amp;D), state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities, and maintenance and support through a combination of product development efforts, capital expansion and the acquisition of Jet Aviation's global support network.\n\nWe are committed to continual investment in R&amp;D to create new aircraft that consistently broaden customer offerings while raising the bar for safety and performance. The result is the unprecedented development of an all-new lineup of the most technologically advanced business jet aircraft in the world. The Gulfstream family of aircraft offer industry-leading cabin, cockpit and safety technologies and the longest ranges at the fastest speeds in their respective classes.\n\nThe  following  represents  Gulfstream's  current  product  line,  along  with  the  maximum  range,  maximum speed, cabin length (excluding baggage), and total number of city-pair speed records held for each aircraft:\n\nThe most recent additions to the in-service Gulfstream fleet are two new large-cabin aircraft, the G500 and G600, which entered service in 2018 and 2019, respectively.

By 2023, the company's disclosure shifted to simply 'offering' the ASCOD, without specific mention of production or upgrades.

      "answer": "In 2022, General Dynamics received a $175 million contract for the production of Hydra-70 rockets as part of its Combat Systems segment. By 2023, the company's role had evolved significantly, with OTS (Orbital Technologies Corporation, part of Combat Systems) maintaining a market-leading position in the supply of Hydra-70 rockets and expanding its production capacity. Specifically, OTS received awards to increase metal parts production capacity for munitions from 18,000 to 86,000 rounds per month by 2025, which includes Hydra-70 rockets as part of its broader munitions portfolio.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, GD received a $175 million contract specifically for the production of Hydra-70 rockets, indicating a direct involvement in the contract fulfillment of this product.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, GD's OTS unit had evolved to a market-leading supplier of Hydra-70 rockets and was expanding production capacity significantly, with a planned increase from 18,000 to 86,000 rounds per month by 2025 as part of a broader munitions production strategy.",
        "Step 3: The evolution from a contract-based production role in 2022 to a strategic, capacity-expanding supplier in 2023 indicates a transformation in GD's engagement with Hydra-70 rockets, moving toward deeper integration and scale."

          "chunk_text": "## Other\n\nGovernment  Contracts. As  a  government  contractor,  we  are  subject  to  U.S.  government  audits  and investigations  relating  to  our  operations,  including  claims  for  fines,  penalties,  and  compensatory  and  treble damages.  We  believe  the  outcome  of  such  ongoing  government  audits  and  investigations  will  not  have  a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\nIn  the  performance  of  our  contracts,  we  routinely  request  contract  modifications  that  require  additional funding from the customer. Most often, these requests are due to customer-directed changes in the scope of work. While we are entitled to recovery of these costs under our contracts, the administrative process with our customer may be protracted. Based on the circumstances, we periodically file requests for equitable adjustment (REAs) that are sometimes converted into claims. In some cases, these requests are disputed by our customer. We believe our outstanding modifications, REAs and other claims will be resolved without material impact to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\nLetters  of  Credit  and  Guarantees. In  the  ordinary  course  of  business,  we  have  entered  into  letters  of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other similar arrangements with financial institutions and insurance carriers totaling approximately $1.2 billion on December 31, 2021. In addition, from time to time and in the ordinary course of business, we contractually guarantee the payment or performance of our subsidiaries arising under certain contracts.\n\nAircraft Trade-ins. In connection with orders for new aircraft in contract backlog, our Aerospace segment has outstanding options with some customers to trade in aircraft as partial consideration in their new-aircraft transaction. These trade-in commitments are generally structured to establish the fair market value of the tradein aircraft at a date generally 45 or fewer days preceding delivery of the new aircraft to the customer. At that time, the customer is required to either exercise the option or allow its expiration. Other trade-in commitments are structured to guarantee a pre-determined trade-in value. These commitments present more risk in the event of an adverse change in market conditions. In either case, any excess of the pre-established trade-in price above the fair market value at the time the new aircraft is delivered is treated as a reduction of revenue in the newaircraft sales transaction. As of December 31, 2021, the estimated change in fair market values from the date of the commitments was not material.\n\nLabor Agreements. On December 31, 2021, approximately one-fifth of the employees of our subsidiaries were working under collectively bargained terms and conditions, including 62 collective agreements that we have negotiated directly with unions and works councils. A number of these agreements expire within any given year.  Historically,  we  have  been  successful  at  renegotiating  these  labor  agreements  without  any  material disruption  of  operating  activities.  In  2022,  we  expect  to  negotiate  the  terms  of  21  agreements  covering approximately  3,000  employees.  We  do  not  expect  the  renegotiations  will,  either  individually  or  in  the aggregate, have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\nProduct Warranties. We provide warranties  to  our  customers  associated  with  certain  product  sales.  We record estimated warranty costs in the period in which the related products are delivered. The warranty liability recorded at each balance sheet date is based generally on the number of months of warranty coverage remaining for the products delivered and the average historical monthly warranty payments. Warranty obligations incurred in connection with long-term production contracts are accounted for within the contract estimates at completion. Our other warranty obligations, primarily for business jet aircraft, are included in other current and noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.",

      "answer": "In 2022, 3M referenced its compliance with ASC 450 for recording liabilities related to legal proceedings but did not specifically mention the methodology for estimating insurance receivables. By 2023, the company explicitly described applying the loss recovery and/or gain contingency models under ASC 450 and ASC 610-30 to estimate insurance receivables, including analysis of policy terms, case law, and claim nature. Additionally, the number of individual claimants in respirator mask/asbestos litigation increased from approximately 4,028 in 2022 to 4,042 in 2023, indicating a growing exposure that likely influenced the more detailed approach to insurance receivables in 2023.",

        "Step 3: The evolution from a general mention of ASC 450 in 2022 to a detailed methodology in 2023, combined with the increase in claimants, shows a transformation in how MMM approaches insurance receivables for legal proceedings."

Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of 3M's Board of Directors.\n\n## Legal Proceedings:\n\nAssessments of lawsuits and claims can involve a series of complex judgments about future events, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain, and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The Company accrues an estimated liability for legal proceeding claims that are both probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 450, Contingencies . Please refer to the section entitled 'Process for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities Related to Legal Proceedings' (contained in 'Legal Proceedings' in Note 16) for additional information about such estimates.\n\n## Pension and Postretirement Obligations:\n\nThe Company applies certain estimates for the discount rates and expected return on plan assets in determining its defined benefit pension and postretirement obligations and related net periodic benefit costs. The below further describes these estimates. Note 13 provides the weighted averages of these assumptions as of applicable dates and for respective periods and additional information on how the rates were determined.\n\n## Discount rate\n\nThe defined benefit pension and postretirement obligation represents the present value of the benefits that employees are entitled to in the future for services already rendered as of the measurement date. The Company measures the present value of these future benefits by projecting benefit payment cash flows for each future period and discounting these cash flows back to the December 31 measurement date, using the yields of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. Service cost and interest cost are measured separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. Service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income. Changes in expected benefit payment and service cost cash flows, as well as ongoing changes in market activity and yields, cause these rates to be subject to uncertainty.\n\nUsing this methodology, the Company determined discount rates for its plans as follow:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, 3M had substantially completed remediation work at the Cottage Grove site and was continuing operational and maintenance activities at Oakdale and Woodbury sites in Minnesota under the May 2007 Settlement Agreement and Consent Order. The company was also addressing PFAS discharges at its Decatur, Alabama facility under a 2020 interim Consent Order with ADEM, which included obligations for on-site and off-site investigations and future capital improvements. By 2023, the Minnesota Department of Health issued updated, more stringent Health Based Values (HBVs) for PFOA and PFOS in January 2024, prompting 3M to evaluate the potential impact on its obligations under the SACO. Additionally, MPCA issued a Notice of Violation in March 2023 alleging PFAS in stormwater discharge at 3M\u2019s Hutchinson facility, and in December 2022, MPCA issued an order addressing stormwater from the Cottage Grove facility. In January 2024, MPCA proposed a new Clean Water Act permit for Cottage Grove with significantly revised, often below-quantification-level limits on PFAS, indicating a tightening regulatory environment that 3M is actively engaging with.",

        "In 2023, regulatory scrutiny intensified in Minnesota with new HBVs in January 2024, a Notice of Violation in March 2023 for stormwater at Hutchinson, and a new permit proposal in January 2024 with stricter PFAS limits for Cottage Grove.",
        "The evolution shows a shift from remediation completion and maintenance to increased regulatory pressure and compliance challenges, particularly with the introduction of more stringent health-based standards and new enforcement actions."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nIn Minnesota, the Company continues to work with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) pursuant to the terms of the previously disclosed May 2007 Settlement Agreement and Consent Order to address the presence of certain PFAS compounds in the soil and groundwater at former disposal sites in Washington County, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury) and at the Company's manufacturing facility at Cottage Grove, Minnesota. Under this agreement, the Company's principal obligations include (i) evaluating releases of certain PFAS compounds from these sites and proposing response actions; (ii) providing treatment or alternative drinking water upon identifying any level exceeding a HBV or Health Risk Limit (HRL) (i.e., the amount of a chemical in drinking water determined by the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) to be safe for human consumption over a lifetime) for certain PFAS compounds for which a HBV and/or HRL exists as a result of contamination from these sites; (iii) remediating identified sources of other PFAS compounds at these sites that are not controlled by actions to remediate PFOA and PFOS; and (iv) sharing information with the MPCA about certain perfluorinated compounds. During 2008, the MPCA issued formal decisions adopting remedial options for the former disposal sites in Washington County, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury). In August 2009, the MPCA issued a formal decision adopting remedial options for the Company's Cottage Grove manufacturing facility. During the spring and summer of 2010, 3M began implementing the agreed upon remedial options at the Cottage Grove and Woodbury sites. 3M commenced the remedial option at the Oakdale site in late 2010. At each location the remedial options were recommended by the Company and approved by the MPCA. The Company has completed remediation work and continues with operational and maintenance activities at the Oakdale and Woodbury sites. Remediation work has been substantially completed at the Cottage Grove site, with operational and maintenance activities ongoing.\n\nIn Alabama, as previously reported, the Company entered into a voluntary remedial action agreement with ADEM to remediate the presence of PFAS in the soil and groundwater at the Company's manufacturing facility in Decatur, Alabama associated with the historic (1978-1998) incorporation of wastewater treatment plant sludge. With ADEM's agreement, 3M substantially completed installation of a multilayer cap on the former sludge incorporation areas. Further remediation activities, including certain on-site and off-site investigations and studies, will be conducted in accordance with the July 2020 Interim Consent Order described below.\n\nThe Company operates under a 2009 consent order issued under the federal Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) (the '2009 TSCA consent order') for the manufacture and use of two perfluorinated materials (FBSA and FBSEE) at its Decatur, Alabama site that does not permit release of these materials into 'the waters of the United States.' In March 2019, the Company halted the manufacture, processing, and use of these materials at the site upon learning that these materials may have been released from certain specified processes at the Decatur site into the Tennessee River. In April 2019, the Company voluntarily disclosed the releases to the U.S. EPA and ADEM. During June and July 2019, the Company took steps to fully control the aforementioned processes by capturing all wastewater produced by the processes and by treating all air emissions. These processes have been back on-line and in operation since July 2019. The Company continues to cooperate with the EPA and ADEM in their investigations and will work with the regulatory authorities to demonstrate compliance with the release restrictions.\n\nThe Company is authorized to discharge wastewater from its Decatur plant pursuant to the terms of a Clean Water Act National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit issued by ADEM. The NPDES permit requires the Company to report on a monthly and quarterly basis the quality and quantity of pollutants discharged to the Tennessee River. In June 2019, as previously reported, the Company voluntarily disclosed to the EPA and ADEM that it had included incorrect values in certain of its monthly and quarterly reports. The Company has submitted the corrected values to both the EPA and ADEM.\n\nAs previously reported, as part of ongoing work with the EPA and ADEM to address compliance matters at the Decatur facility, the Company discovered it had not fully characterized its PFAS discharge in its NPDES permit. In September 2019, the Company disclosed the matter to the EPA and ADEM and announced that it had elected to temporarily idle certain other manufacturing processes at 3M Decatur. The Company is reviewing its operations at the plant, has installed wastewater treatment controls and has restarted idled processes.\n\nAs a result of the Company's discussions with ADEM to address these and other related matters in the state of Alabama, as previously reported, 3M and ADEM agreed to the terms of an interim Consent Order in July 2020 to cover all PFAS-related wastewater discharges and air emissions from the Company's Decatur facility. Under the interim Consent Order, the Company's principal obligations include commitments related to (i) future ongoing site operations such as (a) providing certain notices or reports and performing various analytical and characterization studies and (b) future capital improvements; and (ii) remediation activities, including certain on-site and off-site investigations and studies. Obligations related to ongoing future site operations under the Consent Order will involve additional operating costs and capital expenditures over multiple years. As offsite investigation activities continue, additional remediation amounts may become probable and reasonably estimable in the future.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\nThe Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and to offset, in part, the impacts of changes in value of various nonfunctional currency denominated items including certain intercompany financing balances. The Company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts and price protection agreements.\n\nRefer to Item 7A, 'Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk', for further discussion of foreign exchange rates risk, interest rates risk, commodity prices risk and value at risk analysis.\n\n## Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\n\nIn the context of Item 7A, 3M is exposed to market risk due to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Changes in those factors could impact the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Senior management provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities, determines certain of the Company's financial risk policies and objectives, and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization. Senior management also establishes certain associated procedures relative to control and valuation, risk analysis, counterparty credit approval, and ongoing monitoring and reporting.\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and forward and option contracts. However, the Company's risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Rates Risk:\n\nForeign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company's net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions. 3M is also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the U.S. dollar. The Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. 3M may de-designate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction. The maximum length of time over which 3M hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions is 36 months. In addition, 3M enters into foreign currency contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset, in part, the impacts of changes in value of various non-functional currency denominated items including certain intercompany financing balances. As circumstances warrant, the Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency denominated debt as hedging instruments to hedge portions of the Company's net investments in foreign operations. The dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the Company's foreign exchange forward and option contracts designated as either cash flow hedges or net investment hedges was $2.6 billion at December 31, 2021. The dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the Company's foreign exchange forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments was $3.7 billion at December 31, 2021. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, the Company had \u20ac2.9 billion in principal amount of foreign currency denominated debt designated as non-derivative hedging instruments in certain net investment hedges as discussed in Note 14 in the 'Net Investment Hedges' section.\n\n## Interest Rates Risk:\n\nThe Company may be impacted by interest rate volatility with respect to existing debt and future debt issuances. 3M manages interest rate risk and expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. In addition, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The dollar equivalent (based on inception date foreign currency exchange rates) gross notional amount of the Company's interest rate swaps at December 31, 2021 was $800 million. Additional details about 3M's long-term debt can be found in Note 12, including references to information regarding derivatives and/or hedging instruments, further discussed in Note 14, associated with the Company's long-term debt.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 2020 - $10.1 billion pre-tax actuarial loss related to benefit obligation:\n\n- Discount Rates ($7.3 billion pre-tax loss): The weighted-average discount rate for our pension and postretirement medical plans decreased from 3.55% as of December 31, 2019 to 2.87% as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to a decline in U.S. treasury yields that was slightly offset by an increase in credit spreads on AA-rated corporate bonds.\n- Coordinating benefits attributable to the Central States Pension Fund ($2.3 billion pre-tax loss): This represents our current best estimate of additional potential coordinating benefits that may be required to be paid related to the Central States Pension Fund before taking into account the impact of the change in discount rates.\n- Demographic and Assumption Changes ($513 million pre-tax loss): This represents the difference between actual and estimated participant data and demographic factors, including items such as healthcare cost trends, compensation changes, rates of termination, retirement, mortality and other changes.\n\n## Pension and Postretirement Plan Assets\n\nPension assets are invested in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as investment guidelines established by plan trustees. The strategic asset mixes are specifically tailored for each plan given distinct factors, including liability and liquidity needs. Equities, alternative investments, and other higher yielding assets are utilized to generate returns and promote growth. Derivatives, repurchase/reverse repurchase agreements and fixed income securities are utilized as tools for duration management, mitigating interest rate risk, and minimizing funded status volatility.\n\nThe primary long-term investment objectives for pension assets are to provide for a reasonable amount of long-term growth of capital to meet future obligations while minimizing risk exposures and reducing funded status volatility. To meet these objectives, investment managers are engaged to actively manage assets within the guidelines and strategies set forth by the Investment Committee. Active managers are monitored regularly and their performance is compared to applicable benchmarks. As a result of our long-term U.S. investment objectives for pension assets, the weighted-average long-term expected rate of return on assets decreased from 7.77% during 2020 to 6.50% in 2021.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nPlan assets valued utilizing Level 1 inputs include equity investments, corporate debt instruments and U.S. government securities. Fair values were determined by closing prices for those securities traded on national stock exchanges, while securities traded in the over-the-counter market and listed securities for which no sale was reported on the valuation date are valued at the mean between the last reported bid and ask prices.\n\nLevel 2 assets include fixed income securities that are valued based on yields currently available on comparable securities of other issues with similar credit ratings; mortgage-backed securities that are valued based on cash flow and yield models using acceptable modeling and pricing conventions; and certain investments that are pooled with other investments in a commingled fund. We value our investments in commingled funds by taking the percentage ownership of the underlying assets, each of which has a readily determinable fair value.\n\nFair value estimates for certain investments are based on unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by observable market data and are thus classified as Level 3.\n\nInvestments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, and which provide a net asset value (\"NAV\") or its equivalent developed consistent with FASB measurement principles, are valued using NAV as a practical expedient. These investments are not classified in Levels 1, 2, or 3 of the fair value hierarchy but instead included within the subtotals by asset category. Such investments include hedge funds, risk parity funds, real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds. Investments in hedge funds and risk parity funds are valued using the reported NAV as of December 31st. Real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds are valued at NAV per the most recent partnership audited financial reports, and adjusted, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31st. Due to the inherent limitations in obtaining a readily determinable fair value measurement for alternative investments, the fair values reported may differ from the values that would have been used had readily available market information for the alternative investments existed. These investments are described further below:\n\n- Hedge Funds: Plan assets are invested in hedge funds that pursue multiple strategies to diversify risk and reduce volatility. Most of these hedge funds allow redemptions either quarterly or semi-annually after a two to three month notice period,",

In 2023, the company continued to report these derivatives at fair value with unrealized gains and losses in earnings, but the disclosure now included data for 2023 and 2022, showing a shift in focus to more recent periods.

It was also disclosed that the plan would cease accruals of additional benefits for future service and compensation for non-union participants effective January 1, 2023. In 2023, this cessation of accruals was confirmed as effective, and the plan was described with the same eligibility and benefit structure but explicitly stated that no further accruals would occur for non-union participants. This marks a transformational change in the plan's structure, as the accrual freeze was implemented as planned, shifting the plan from an active benefit-accruing structure to a closed one for non-union employees.

COMPANY-SPONSORED EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\n\nWe sponsor various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit and defined contribution plans which cover our employees worldwide.\n\n## U.S. Pension Benefits\n\nIn the U.S. we maintain the following single-employer defined benefit pension plans: the UPS Retirement Plan, the UPS Pension Plan, the UPS/IBT Full-Time Employee Pension Plan and the UPS Excess Coordinating Benefit Plan, a non-qualified plan.\n\nThe UPS Retirement Plan is noncontributory and includes substantially all eligible employees of participating domestic subsidiaries hired prior to July 1, 2016 who are not members of a collective bargaining unit, as well as certain employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement. This plan generally provides for retirement benefits based on average compensation earned by employees prior to retirement. Benefits payable under this plan are subject to maximum compensation limits and the annual benefit limits for a tax-qualified defined benefit plan as prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service ('IRS').\n\nThe UPS Pension Plan is noncontributory and includes certain eligible employees of participating domestic subsidiaries and members of collective bargaining units that elect to participate in the plan. This plan generally provides for retirement benefits based on service credits earned by employees prior to retirement.\n\nThe UPS/IBT Full-Time Employee Pension Plan is noncontributory and includes employees that were previously members of the Central States Pension Fund (\"CSPF\"), a multiemployer pension plan, in addition to other eligible employees who are covered under certain collective bargaining agreements. This plan generally provides for retirement benefits based on service credits earned by employees prior to retirement.\n\nThe UPS Excess Coordinating Benefit Plan is a non-qualified plan that provides benefits to certain participants in the UPS Retirement Plan, hired prior to July 1, 2016, for amounts that exceed the benefit limits described above.\n\nThe UPS Retirement Plan and the UPS Excess Coordinating Benefit Plan will cease accruals of additional benefits for future service and compensation for non-union participants effective January 1, 2023.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, certain former U.S. employees were offered the option to receive a one-time payment of their vested pension benefit. Approximately 18,800 former employees accepted this option, accelerating $820 million in benefit payments during 2019 while reducing the number of participants who are due future payments from U.S. pension plans. As the cost of these settlements did not exceed the plans' service cost and interest cost for the year, the impact of the settlement was not recognized in earnings.\n\nOn April 30, 2021, we completed the divestiture of UPS Freight as discussed in note 4. The divestiture triggered an interim remeasurement of certain UPS-sponsored pension and postretirement medical benefit plans under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 715- Compensation- Retirement Benefits ('ASC 715'). Accordingly, we remeasured the plan assets and benefit obligations of the UPS Pension Plan, UPS Retirement Plan and UPS Retired Employee Health Care Plan as of April 30, 2021.\n\nThe interim remeasurement resulted in an actuarial gain of $2.1 billion. The actuarial gain reflects a $3.7 billion benefit from a 49 basis point increase in the discount rate compared to December 31, 2020 and a $0.1 billion benefit related to workforce reductions associated with the divestiture, offset by a $1.7 billion loss resulting from actual returns being approximately 430 basis points below expected returns. The $2.1 billion actuarial gain was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\") within the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet. A pre-tax actuarial gain of $69 million ($52 million after tax) was immediately recognized for a prior service credit related to the divested group in the statement of consolidated income for the second quarter. We also amended certain benefit terms within these plans as of April 30, 2021. The amendment to the UPS Pension Plan resulted in the immediate recognition of a $66 million ($50 million after tax) loss in the statement of consolidated income for the second quarter.\n\nThe impacts of the plan remeasurements and plan amendments are included within Other expenses in the statements of consolidated income as components of the divestiture of UPS Freight.",

      "answer": "In 2022, UPS disclosed that foreign currency exchange forward contracts were used to economically offset foreign currency remeasurement and settlement risk for certain balance sheet assets and liabilities, and that changes in their fair value affected earnings directly. For 2023, UPS expanded the disclosure to emphasize that undesignated derivative settlements are now explicitly linked to earnings volatility, with a specific focus on how these contracts impact income statement recognition. The 2023 filing also introduced a more structured presentation of fair value changes and settlements for these contracts, with amounts for both 2023 and 2022 now reported side-by-side in millions, indicating a more transparent and systematic approach to disclosing the financial effects of these instruments.",

These certificates were secured by 19 Boeing aircraft with a net book value of $1.8 billion. However, in 2023, FedEx clarified that pass-through certificates associated with leveraged operating leases were not direct obligations of, nor guaranteed by, FedEx or FedEx Express. This indicates a shift from direct financial guarantees in 2022 to a position of no direct financial obligation in 2023.",

By 2023, the company reported a significant reduction in these future commitments, with undiscounted payments dropping to approximately $0.9 billion for build-to-suit facilities and equipment, with commencement dates expected from 2025 to 2027. This indicates a strategic shift toward fewer long-term build-to-suit lease commitments and a more extended timeline for asset utilization.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Honeywell reported $1,244 million invested in private funds, as disclosed in the 2022 10-K filing. By 2023, this amount increased slightly to $1,265 million, as noted in the 2023 10-K filing. This represents a modest increase of approximately 1.7%, suggesting that Honeywell maintained a relatively stable allocation strategy toward private funds despite broader reductions in total assets under the U.S. plans. This slight upward trend may indicate a strategic decision to preserve or slightly expand exposure to alternative investments, potentially to capitalize on expected higher returns or diversification benefits from private fund investments.",

        "Step 3: Analyze the 1.7% increase in private fund allocation in the context of overall investment reductions, suggesting a deliberate capital deployment strategy favoring private funds."

      "answer": "Honeywell's financial dependency on the Resideo subsidiary for environmental liabilities remained consistent between 2022 and 2023, with Resideo's subsidiary still obligated to pay 90% of Honeywell's annual net spending on environmental matters at specified sites, up to a maximum of $140 million per year. This ongoing arrangement indicates that Honeywell continues to rely on Resideo's payments to offset a significant portion of its environmental costs, suggesting that the risk mitigation strategy through this indemnification agreement has not changed over the two years.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, Honeywell disclosed that Resideo's subsidiary was obligated to pay 90% of Honeywell's annual net spending on environmental matters at certain sites, capped at $140 million per year.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the same terms were reiterated, showing no change in the financial arrangement or cap amount, indicating continued dependency.",
        "Step 3: Since the terms and financial obligations remained identical in both years, Honeywell's dependency on the Resideo subsidiary for environmental liabilities did not evolve, signaling a stable risk-sharing arrangement."

      "answer": "In 2022, Honeywell reported the Safety and Retail business unit as a standalone component under the Safety and Productivity Solutions segment, generating $2,387 million in revenue. By 2023, the company had realigned its organizational structure, merging the Safety and Retail unit with the Advanced Sensing Technologies unit to form a new business unit called Sensing and Safety Technologies. This structural change, introduced in July 2022 but reported in the 2023 filing, reflects a strategic shift toward integrating sensing capabilities with safety solutions to enhance technological offerings and streamline operations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Safety and Retail was a distinct business unit under Safety and Productivity Solutions with $2,387 million in revenue.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the Safety and Retail unit was no longer standalone; it was combined with Advanced Sensing Technologies to form the new Sensing and Safety Technologies unit.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a transformation in Honeywell\u2019s approach, integrating sensing and safety technologies into a unified business unit, indicating a strategic evolution in how the company organizes and develops its Safety and Retail-related offerings."

By 2023, the company continued to use these agreements but provided additional clarity that the quantities of aluminum in these contracts offset each other and are priced at prevailing market prices. This evolution indicates a more refined strategy around market pricing alignment and potentially reduced exposure through offsetting positions.",

      "answer": "In 2022, 'upgrades and conversions' were listed as part of a broader set of services under the Global Services segment, grouped alongside supply chain logistics, engineering, maintenance, spare parts, training systems, technical documents, and digital services. The description was general and lacked strategic framing. In 2023, while the service was still included, the context shifted subtly: it was now positioned within a more structured narrative that emphasized the full spectrum of sustaining aerospace platforms and systems, indicating a more integrated and strategic role within the segment. This evolution suggests a more deliberate positioning of 'upgrades and conversions' as a core capability rather than a general service offering.",

BGS  sustains  aerospace platforms and systems with a full spectrum of products and services, including supply chain and logistics management, engineering, maintenance and modifications, upgrades and conversions, spare parts, pilot and maintenance training systems and services, technical and maintenance documents, and data analytics and digital services.\n\n## Boeing Capital Segment\n\nBCC seeks to ensure that Boeing customers have the financing they need to buy and take delivery of their Boeing product,  while  managing  overall  financing  exposure.  BCC's  portfolio  consists  of  equipment  under  operating  leases, sales-type/finance leases, notes and other receivables, assets held for sale or re-lease and investments.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nWe own numerous patents and have licenses for the use of patents owned by others, which relate to our products and their manufacture. In addition to owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to and  from  third  parties.  For  example,  the  U.S.  government  has  licenses  in  our  patents  that  are  developed  in performance  of  government  contracts,  and  it  may  use  or  authorize  others  to  use  the  inventions  covered  by  such patents  for  government  purposes.  Unpatented  research,  development  and  engineering  skills,  as  well  as  certain trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights, also make an important contribution to our business. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses, we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement.\n\n## Human Capital\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact lives and businesses around the world. We have taken proactive steps to help protect the health and safety of our employees and maintain business continuity. As COVID-19 vaccines became available, we strongly encouraged employees to get vaccinated when eligible, followed federal and state government vaccination requirements, provided resources and support to help employees get vaccinated, offered paid time off for primary and booster vaccinations, and supported vaccination clinics for our employees and their families. We provided access to virtual  primary  care  physicians  at  no  cost.  We  expanded  our  virtual  work  options  and  many  of  our  office workers continue to telecommute. We have maintained safety protocols at our sites, including face coverings, physical distance requirements and enhanced cleaning requirements. We continue to encourage daily self-health checks and operate our coronavirus hotline, which enables employees to report exposure to COVID-19 and positive COVID-19 test results  directly  to  our  Health  Services  group.  As  part  of  that  reporting  process,  we  have  a  robust  contact  tracing program to identify those who have been in close contact in the workplace with employees who have tested positive for COVID-19. All of the actions above are overseen by Boeing's Crisis Management Working Group, a multi-functional, multi-discipline team tasked with integrating all aspects of Boeing's COVID-19 response.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, Boeing's total workforce was approximately 142,000, with 12% located outside of the U.S.\n\n2",

      "question": "How has Boeing's approach to in-orbit incentive payments evolved between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of risk exposure and financial recognition?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Boeing highlighted the financial risks associated with in-orbit incentive payments, particularly in the context of potential program cancellations or failure to meet performance criteria, which could trigger termination provisions or loss of payments. The company noted that these risks were part of ongoing fixed-price development programs like Commercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, and VC-25B. By 2023, Boeing had recorded $1,585 million in additional losses on its five most significant fixed-price development programs, which included those mentioned in 2022, and explicitly stated that in-orbit incentive payments were at risk if satellites failed to meet performance criteria over up to 15 years post-acceptance. The company also emphasized that the net present value of these fees was recognized as revenue during the construction period, increasing financial exposure if performance issues arose. This represents a shift from general risk acknowledgment in 2022 to a more specific quantification of losses and a detailed explanation of revenue recognition practices tied to in-orbit performance in 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Boeing identified in-orbit incentive payments as a risk within fixed-price development programs, with potential financial exposure if performance criteria were not met.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, Boeing quantified losses on major fixed-price programs at $1,585 million and elaborated on the revenue recognition tied to in-orbit performance, with explicit mention of up to 15 years of risk exposure.",
        "Step 3: The evolution shows a shift from general risk disclosure to a more detailed financial quantification and explanation of how in-orbit incentive payments are recognized and exposed to long-term performance risks."

The $168 million reach-forward loss in the first quarter of 2020 on VC-25B was associated with engineering inefficiencies from the COVID-19 environment.\n\nBDS  earnings  from  operations  in  2020  decreased  by  $1,076  million  compared  with  2019  primarily  due  to  the unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $828 million higher than the prior year, largely due to higher charges in 2020 of $1,320 million on KC-46A Tanker and $168 million on VC-25B, offset by $489 million in charges on Commercial Crew in 2019. The lower earnings in 2020 also reflect lower gains on property sales compared to the same period in 2019. These current period decreases were partially offset by the volume increases described above.\n\nBDS earnings from operations includes our share of income or loss from equity method investments of $53 million, $141 million and $128 million primarily from our ULA and non-U.S. joint ventures in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## Backlog\n\nTotal backlog of $59,828 million at December 31, 2021 was $1,019 million lower than December 31, 2020 due to the timing of awards and revenue recognized.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\nOur BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense, Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.\n\nSome of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis, and BDS customers are increasingly seeking fixed-price proposals for new programs. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include Commercial Crew,  KC-46A  Tanker,  MQ-25,  T-7A  Red  Hawk,  VC-25B,  and  commercial  and  military  satellites.  A  number  of  our ongoing fixed-price development programs have reach-forward losses. New programs could also have risk for reachforward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. Many development programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which  could  result  in  a  material  charge  or  otherwise  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition.  These  programs  are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery  dates  could  be  extended,  which  could  trigger  termination  provisions,  the  loss  of  satellite  in-orbit incentive payments or other financially significant exposure. Risk remains that we may be required to record additional reach-forward losses in future periods.",

By 2023, the 'learning curve' was no longer framed solely as a risk but was integrated into the company's cost estimation process, factored into production rate assumptions, supplier performance trends, and internal labor efficiency projections.

          "chunk_text": "expected.  These  impacts have resulted in longer than expected delivery delays and associated  customer considerations.\n\nThe timing of the resumption of deliveries and future production rates will depend upon rework, ongoing customer and supplier  engagement,  production  stability  and  our  activities  with  the  FAA.  China  is  a  significant  market  for  the  787 program, and if the program is unable to obtain additional orders from China in future quarters, we may be required to further  adjust  production  rate  assumptions.  If  we  are  required  to  further  reduce  the  accounting  quantity  and/or production  rates,  experience  further  delivery  delays  or  experience  other  factors  that  result  in  lower  margins,  the program could record additional losses and higher abnormal production costs in future periods.\n\nFleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane  delivery  and  continue  throughout  the  operational  life  of  the  airplane.  They  include  flight  and  maintenance training,  field  service  support,  engineering  services,  information  services  and  systems  and  technical  data  and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have historically been approximately 1% of total consolidated costs of products and services.\n\nProgram  Development The  following  chart  summarizes  the  time  horizon  between  go-ahead  and  planned  initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs.\n\nReflects models in development during 2021\n\nThe development schedules shown above are subject to a number of uncertainties, including changes in certification requirements. The timing of certifications will ultimately be determined by the regulators.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\nThe development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with suppliers and highly-skilled labor from employees and other partners. Meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging, such as the 787 production issues and associated rework. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such as the 777X and 737 MAX derivatives, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules.  These  challenges include increased global regulatory scrutiny of all development aircraft in the wake of the 737 MAX accidents. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance  and  reliability  standards  and  achieve  or  maintain,  as  applicable,  program  profitability  is  subject  to significant  risks.  Factors  that  could  result  in  lower  margins  (or  a  material  charge  if  an  airplane  program  has  or  is determined to have reach-forward losses) include the following: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalation factors due to changes in the inflation rate or other economic indicators, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation, achieving anticipated cost reductions, the addition of regulatory requirements in connection with certification in one or more jurisdictions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for new airplanes and derivatives and status of customer claims, supplier claims or assertions and other contractual negotiations.

      "answer": "In 2023, Emerson (via its AspenTech subsidiary) entered into an agreement to acquire Micromine for AU$900 (approximately $623 USD), but later terminated the agreement due to uncertainty around Russian regulatory approval. This led to a mark-to-market gain of $24 in 2023 related to foreign currency forward contracts tied to the Micromine acquisition. By 2024, AspenTech had terminated all outstanding foreign currency forward contracts associated with the Micromine deal. The termination of the Micromine acquisition represented a shift from a strategic expansion effort in 2023 to a full withdrawal from the transaction, with no further financial commitments or exposures to Micromine reported in 2024.",

      "question": "How did Emerson's relationship with AspenTech evolve from 2023 to 2024, and what financial impacts did this transformation have on Emerson's gross margin and ownership structure?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Emerson had a business relationship with AspenTech as part of its Software and Control offerings. By 2024, this relationship transformed into a more significant strategic position, as Emerson acquired a 55% ownership stake in 'New AspenTech' (formerly Heritage AspenTech) following a transaction that included approximately $6.0 billion in cash. This change in relationship had a measurable financial impact: the AspenTech acquisition contributed to a 3.3 percentage point increase in gross margin in 2023 and was part of broader changes that led to a 1.8 percentage point increase in gross margin in 2024. Additionally, the ownership stake marked a structural shift in Emerson\u2019s involvement with AspenTech, moving from a partner to a majority shareholder.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, AspenTech was listed under Emerson\u2019s Software and Control offerings, indicating a partnership relationship.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, Emerson completed a transaction that gave it 55% ownership in AspenTech, marking a strategic shift from a partner to a majority owner.",
        "Step 3: The financial impact of this evolution is seen in the gross margin improvements in both years, with AspenTech contributing 0.6 percentage points to the 3.3 percentage point increase in 2023, and the continued influence of the acquisition reflected in the 2024 margin performance."

Upon closing of the transaction, Emerson owned 55 percent of the outstanding shares of AspenTech common stock (on a fully diluted basis). AspenTech and its subsidiaries now operate under Heritage AspenTech's prev ious name 'Aspen Technology, Inc.' and AspenTech common stock is traded on NASDAQ under AspenTech's previous stock ticker symbol 'AZPN.' Due to the timing of the acquisition, the results for the first half of fiscal 2022 do not include the results of Heritage AspenTech.\n\nSee Notes 4, 5 and 8 and Item 1A - \"Risk Factors\" for further information on acquisitions and div estitures.\n\n## COST OF SALES\n\nCost of sales for 2024 were $8,607, an increase of $869 compared with $7,738 in 2023, reflecting the impact of higher v olume and the Test &amp; Measurement acquisition. Gross profit was $8,885 in 2024 compared to $7,427 in 2023, while gross margin increased 1.8 percentage points to 50.8 percent, reflecting the Test &amp; Measurement acquisition and higher price partially offset by the impact from acquisition-related inv entory step-up amortization of $231, which negativ ely impacted margins by approximately 1.3 percentage points.\n\nCost of sales for 2023 were $7,738, an increase of $240 compared with $7,498 in 2022. Gross profit was $7,427 in 2023 compared to $6,306 in 2022, while gross margin increased 3.3 percentage points to 49.0 percent due to fav orable price less net material inflation, the impact of the Heritage AspenTech acquisition which benefited margins by 0.6 percentage points, and fav orable mix.\n\n## SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\n\nSG&amp;A expenses of $5,142 in 2024 increased $956 compared with 2023 and SG&amp;A as a percent of sales increased 1.8 percentage points to 29.4 percent, reflecting the impact of the Test &amp; Measurement acquisition, partially offset by strong operating lev erage on higher sales.\n\nSG&amp;A expenses of $4,186 in 2023 increased $572 compared with 2022 and SG&amp;A as a percent of sales increased 1.4 percentage points to 27.6 percent, reflecting the Heritage AspenTech acquisition and higher stock compensation expense of $125, of which $75 related to Emerson stock plans due to a higher share price and $50 was attributable to AspenTech stock plans. These items were partially offset by strong operating lev erage on higher sales.\n\n## SALE OF COPELAND NOTE RECEIVABLE AND EQUITY INTEREST\n\nOn June 6, 2024, the Company entered into definitiv e agreements to sell its 40 percent non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland to priv ate equity funds managed by Blackstone for $1.5 billion and its note receiv able to Copeland for $1.9 billion, and the transactions were subsequently completed in August 2024. Upon entering into the note agreement, the Company recorded a pretax loss in continuing operations of $279 ($217 after-tax, $0.38 per share) to adjust the carrying v alue of the note to $1.9 billion to reflect the transaction price, while the Company recognized a gain of $539 ($435 after-tax) in discontinued operations upon the sale of the common equity interest. In addition, the equity method losses related to the Company's non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland, which were reported since May 2023 in Other deductions, net, hav e been reclassified and are now reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\n\n## GAIN ON SUBORDINATED INTEREST\n\nIn the first quarter of 2022, the Company receiv ed a distribution of $438 related to its subordinated interest in Vertiv  (in total, a pretax gain of $453 was recognized in the first quarter of 2022, $358 after-tax, $0.60 per share) and receiv ed the remaining $15 related to the pretax gain in the first quarter of 2023. In 2023, the Company receiv ed additional distributions totaling $161 ($122 after-tax, $0.21 per share) and in 2024, receiv ed its final distribution of $79 ($60 after-tax, $0.10 per share).\n\n## OTHER DEDUCTIONS, NET\n\nOther deductions, net were $1,434 in 2024, an increase of $928 compared with 2023. The current year included intangibles amortization related to the Test &amp; Measurement acquisition of $560, while restructuring costs increased by $156 and acquisition/div estiture costs increased by $27. The Company also incurred div estiture losses of $48 ($50 after-tax, $0.09 per share).\n\nOther deductions, net were $506 in 2023, a decrease of $13 compared with 2022, and included higher intangibles amortization of $146 primarily related to the Heritage AspenTech acquisition and an unfav orable impact from foreign currency transactions of $112 reflecting losses in the current year compared to gains in the prior year.

Coal traffic originating in the Powder Riv er Basin (PRB) area of Wyoming is the largest portion of the Railroad's coal business.\n\nIndustrial -  Our extensiv e network facilitates the mov ement of numerous commodities between thousands of origin and destination points throughout North America. The Industrial group consists of sev eral categories, including construction, industrial chemicals, plastics, forest products, specialized products (primarily waste, salt, and roofing), metals and ores, petroleum, liquid petroleum gases (LPG), soda ash, and sand. Transportation of these products accounted for 37% of our freight rev enues in 2024. Commercial, residential, and gov ernmental infrastructure inv estments driv e shipments of steel,  aggregates, cement, and wood products. Industrial and light manufacturing plants receiv e steel, nonferrous materials, minerals, and other raw materials.\n\nThe industrial chemicals market consists of a v ast number of chemical compounds that support the manufacturing of more complex chemicals. Plastics shipments support automotiv e, housing, and the durable and disposable consumer goods markets. Forest product shipments include lumber and paper commodities. Lumber shipments originate primarily in the Pacific Northwest or Western Canada and mov e throughout the U.S. for use in new home construction  and  repairs  and  remodeling.  Paper  shipments  primarily  support  packaging  needs.  Oil  and  gas  drilling  generates  demand  for  raw  steel, finished pipe, stone, and drilling fluid commodities. T he Company's petroleum and LPG shipments are primarily impacted by refinery utilization rates, regional  crude  pricing  differentials,  pipeline  capacity,  and  the  use  of  asphalt  for  road  programs.  Soda  ash  originates  in  southwestern  Wyoming  and California, destined for chemical and glass producing markets in North America and abroad.\n\nPremium -  In  2024,  Premium shipments generated 31% of Union Pacific's total freight rev enues. Premium includes finished automobiles, automotiv e parts, and merchandise in intermodal containers, both domestic and international. International business consists of import and export traffic mov ing in 20 or 40-foot shipping containers, that mainly pass through West Coast ports, destined for one of the Company's many inland intermodal terminals. Domestic business includes container and trailer traffic  picked  up  and  deliv ered  within  North America  for  intermodal  marketing  companies  (primarily shipper agents and logistics companies) as well as truckload carriers.\n\nWe are the largest  automotiv e  carrier  west  of  the  Mississippi  Riv er  and  operate  or  access  39  v ehicle  distribution  centers.  T he  Railroad's  extensiv e franchise  accesses  six  v ehicle  assembly  plants  and  connects  to  West  Coast  ports,  all  six  major  Mexico  gateways,  and  the  Port  of  Houston  to accommodate both import and export shipments. In addition to transporting finished v ehicles, the Company prov ides expedited handling of automotiv e parts in both boxcars and intermodal containers destined for Mexico, the U.S., and Canada.\n\nSeasonality - Some of the commodities we carry hav e peak shipping seasons, reflecting either or both the nature of the commodity (such as certain agricultural and food products that hav e specific growing and harv esting seasons) and the demand cycle for the commodity (such as intermodal traffic that generally peaks during the third quarter to meet back-to-school and holiday-related demand for consumer goods during the fourth quarter). The peak shipping seasons for these commodities can v ary considerably each year depending upon v arious factors, including the strength of domestic and",

      "answer": "In 2022, Union Pacific owned 78,837 units and leased 16,004 units of Total Highway Revenue Equipment, with containers making up the majority of owned assets and chassis being heavily leased. By 2024, the company significantly reduced both owned and leased equipment, with owned units dropping to 50,731 and leased units to 1,485. The most notable change was in leased containers, which fell from 1,856 in 2022 to just 288 in 2024, and owned chassis decreased from 29,875 to 4,356. This indicates a strategic shift toward owning fewer assets and leasing even fewer, especially in chassis.",

T he following is a description of the v aluation methodologies used for the inv estments measured at fair value, including the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the v aluation hierarchy.\n\nFederal Government Securities - Federal Gov ernment Securities consist of bills, notes, bonds, and other fixed income securities issued directly by the  U.S.  T reasury  or  by  gov ernment-sponsored  enterprises.  T hese  assets  are  v alued  using  a  bid  ev aluation  process  with  bid  data  prov ided  by independent pricing sources. Federal Gov ernment Securities are classified as Lev el 2 inv estments.\n\nBonds and Debentures -  Bonds  and  debentures  consist  of  debt  securities  issued  by  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  corporations  as  well  as  state  and  local governments.  These assets are v alued  using  a  bid  ev aluation  process  with  bid  data  prov ided  by  independent  pricing  sources.  Corporate,  state,  and municipal bonds and debentures are classified as Lev el 2 inv estments.\n\nCorporate Stock - This inv estment category consists of common and preferred stock issued by U.S. and non-U.S. corporations. Most common shares are traded activ ely on exchanges and price quotes for these shares are readily av ailable. Common stock is classified as a Lev el 1 inv estment. Preferred shares included in this category are v alued using a bid ev aluation process with bid data prov ided by independent pricing sources. Preferred stock is classified as a Lev el 2 inv estment.\n\nVenture Capital and Buyout Partnerships - This inv estment category is comprised of interests in limited partnerships that inv est primarily in priv atelyheld companies. Due to the priv ate nature of the partnership inv estments, pricing inputs are not readily observ able. Asset v aluations are dev eloped by the general partners that manage the partnerships. These v aluations are based on the application of public market multiples to priv ate company cash flows, market transactions that prov ide v aluation information for comparable companies, and other methods. The fair v alue recorded by the plan is calculated using each partnership's net asset v alue (NAV).\n\nReal Estate Funds -  T he  plan's  real  estate  inv estments  are  primarily  interests  in  priv ate  real  estate  inv estment  trusts,  partnerships,  limited  liability companies, and similar structures. Valuations for the holdings in this category are not based on readily observ able inputs and are primarily deriv ed from property appraisals. The fair v alue recorded by the plan is calculated using the NAV for each inv estment.\n\nCollective  Trust  and  Other  Funds -  Collectiv e  trust  and  other  funds  are  comprised  of  shares  or  units  in  commingled  funds  and  limited  liability companies that are not publicly traded. The underlying assets in these entities (global stock funds and short-term inv estment funds) are publicly traded on exchanges and price quotes for the assets held by these funds are readily av ailable. The fair v alue recorded by the plan is calculated using NAV for each inv estment.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Lockheed Martin transferred $4.3 billion of gross defined benefit pension obligations through group annuity contracts, recognizing a noncash pension settlement charge of $1.5 billion. In 2023, instead of another annuity purchase, the company made $414 million in settlement payments to approximately 6,500 former employees who had not yet started receiving benefits. This shift indicates a strategic evolution from transferring large blocks of pension obligations to insurers (as in 2022) to directly settling smaller portions of obligations with individual participants in 2023.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Long-Term Debt\n\nIn September 2021, we repaid $500 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 3.35% according to their scheduled maturities.\n\nWe  made  interest  payments  of  approximately  $543  million,  $567  million  and  $625  million  during  the  years  ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## Note 12 - Postretirement Benefit Plans\n\n## Plan Descriptions\n\nMany of our employees and retirees participate in various postretirement benefit plans including defined benefit pension plans, retiree  medical  and  life  insurance  plans,  defined  contribution  retirement  savings  plans,  and  other  postemployment  plans. Substantially all of our postretirement benefit obligations relate to U.S. based defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans. The majority of our U.S. defined benefit pension plans provide for benefits within limits imposed by federal tax law (referred to as qualified plans). However, certain of our U.S. defined benefit pension plans provide for benefits in excess of qualified plan limits imposed by federal tax law (referred to as nonqualified plans).\n\nSalaried employees hired after December 31, 2005 are not eligible to participate in our qualified defined benefit pension plans, but are eligible to participate in a qualified defined contribution plan in addition to our other retirement savings plans. They also have the ability to participate in our retiree medical plans, but we do not subsidize the cost of their participation in those plans as we do with employees hired before January 1, 2006. Over the last few years, we have negotiated similar changes with various labor organizations such that new union represented employees do not participate in our defined benefit pension plans. Our qualified defined benefit pension plans for salaried employees were fully frozen effective January 1, 2020, at which time such employees no longer earn additional benefits under the defined benefit pension plans and were transitioned to an enhanced defined contribution retirement savings plan.\n\nOn August 3, 2021, we purchased group annuity contracts to transfer $4.9 billion of gross defined benefit pension obligations and  related  plan  assets  from  certain  of  our  qualified  defined  benefit  pension  plans  to  an  insurance  company  for  approximately 18,000 U.S. retirees and beneficiaries. The group annuity contracts were purchased using assets from Lockheed Martin's master retirement trust and no additional funding contribution was required by us. As a result of this transaction, we were relieved of all responsibility  for  these  pension  obligations  and  the  insurance  company  is  now  required  to  pay  and  administer  the  retirement benefits beginning on January 1, 2022. This transaction had no impact on the amount, timing, or form of the monthly retirement benefit payments to the affected retirees and beneficiaries. In connection with this transaction, we recognized a noncash pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion ($1.3 billion, or $4.72 per share, after tax) for the affected plans in 2021, which represents the accelerated recognition of actuarial losses that were included in the AOCL account within stockholders' equity.\n\nOn  December  3,  2020,  we  purchased  a  group  annuity  contract  to  transfer  $1.4  billion  of  gross  defined  benefit  pension obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company for approximately 13,500 U.S. retirees and beneficiaries. As a result of this transaction, we were relieved of all responsibility for these pension obligations and the insurance company is now required to pay and administer the retirement benefits. Although this transaction was treated as a settlement for accounting purposes, we were not required to recognize a settlement charge because the aggregate value of settlements for the affected plans in 2020 were less than each plan's service and interest cost.\n\nAlso on December 3, 2020, we purchased a group annuity contract pursuant to which an insurance company will reimburse the affected  qualified  defined  benefit  pension  plan  for  $793  million  of  gross  defined  benefit  pension  obligations  for  approximately 2,500 U.S. retirees and beneficiaries. Under the terms of the arrangement, the plan retains the obligation for paying the pension benefits to the covered retirees and beneficiaries and the insurance company will reimburse the plan as those benefits are paid. The group annuity contract provides us the option to transfer the defined benefit pension obligations to the insurance company at our discretion.  Because  the  plan  retains  the  obligation  for  paying  the  pension  benefits  to  the  covered  retirees  and  beneficiaries  this transaction was not treated as a settlement for accounting purpose and we were not required to recognize a settlement charge.",

Aeronautics also has contracts with the U.S. Government for classified programs. Aeronautics' major programs include:\n\n- F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter - international multi-role, multi-variant, fifth generation stealth fighter;\n- C-130 Hercules - international tactical airlifter;\n- F-16 Fighting Falcon - low-cost, combat-proven, international multi-role fighter; and\n- F-22 Raptor - air dominance and multi-role fifth generation stealth fighter.\n\nThe F-35 program is our largest program, generating 27% of our total consolidated net sales, as well as 68% of Aeronautics' net  sales  in  2021.  The  F-35  program  consists  of  multiple  development,  production  and  sustainment  contracts.  Development  is focused on modernization of F-35's capability and addressing emerging threats. Sustainment provides logistics and training support for the aircraft delivered to F-35 customers.\n\nProduction of the aircraft is expected to continue for many years given the U.S. Government's current inventory objective of 2,456  aircraft  for  the  U.S.  Air  Force,  U.S.  Marine  Corps  and  U.S.  Navy;  commitments  from  our  seven  international  partner countries  and  six  international  customers;  and  expressions  of  interest  from  other  countries.  In  2021,  we  delivered  142  aircraft, including 68 to international customers, resulting in total deliveries of 753 production aircraft since program inception. This was an increase  from  the  120  aircraft  delivered  in  2020  when  the  production  rate  was  tapered  as  a  result  of  coronavirus  disease  2019 (COVID-19) related  delays. While  the  production  rate  in  2021  improved  from  its  2020  levels,  it  continued  to  be  impacted  by COVID-19. We anticipate delivering 148-153 aircraft in 2022. In 2023 and beyond, we anticipate delivering 156 aircraft for the foreseeable  future.  We  have  230  aircraft  in  backlog  as  of  December  31,  2021  extending  into  2023,  including  orders  from  our international partner countries. For additional information on the F-35 program, see 'Status of the F-35 Program' in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. See also Item 1A - Risk Factors for a discussion of risks related to the F-35 program.\n\nAeronautics produces and provides support and sustainment services for the C-130J Super Hercules, as well as upgrades and support services for the legacy C-130 Hercules worldwide fleet. We delivered 22 C-130J aircraft in 2021. We have 79 aircraft in our backlog as of December 31, 2021, extending into 2025.\n\nAeronautics produces F-16 aircraft for international customers and continues to provide service-life extension, modernization and  other  upgrade  programs  for  our  customers'  F-16  aircraft,  with  existing  contracts  continuing  for  several  years.  As  of December 31, 2021, we have 128 F-16 aircraft in backlog, extending into 2027. We continue to seek international opportunities to deliver additional aircraft.\n\nAeronautics continues to provide modernization and sustainment activities for the U.S. Air Force's F-22 aircraft fleet. The modernization  program  comprises  upgrading  existing  systems  requirements,  developing  new  systems  requirements,  adding capabilities and enhancing the performance of the weapon systems. The sustainment program consists of sustaining the weapon systems of the F-22 fleet, providing training systems, customer support, integrated support planning, supply chain management, aircraft modifications and heavy maintenance, systems engineering and support products.\n\nIn addition to the aircraft programs discussed above, Aeronautics is involved in advanced development programs incorporating innovative  design  and  rapid  prototype  applications.  Our Advanced  Development  Programs  (ADP)  organization,  also  known  as Skunk Works , is focused on future systems, including unmanned and manned aerial systems and next generation capabilities for hypersonics, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, situational awareness and air mobility. We continue to explore technology advancement  and  insertion  into  our  existing  aircraft.

      "question": "How did Lockheed Martin's approach to pension risk transfer transactions evolve from 2022 to 2023, particularly in terms of financial impact and strategic intent?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Lockheed Martin detailed a specific pension risk transfer transaction from August 3, 2021, where $4.9 billion of gross defined benefit pension obligations were transferred via group annuity contracts (GACs), resulting in a noncash pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion. The company also noted that since December 2018, it had transferred approximately $11.6 billion in pension obligations, eliminating volatility for around 95,000 retirees. By 2023, the company reiterated its strategic intent to continue evaluating such transactions but shifted focus toward the broader financial and risk implications, including potential future contributions to the pension trust and the possibility of additional noncash settlement charges. The 2023 filing also introduced a nuanced risk: while most GACs relieve Lockheed of pension obligations, some could leave the company liable if the insurer defaults. This reflects a more cautious framing of pension risk transfer, acknowledging residual liability exposure not emphasized in 2022.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Lockheed Martin disclosed a specific pension risk transfer of $4.9 billion with a $1.7 billion noncash settlement charge and cumulative transfers totaling $11.6 billion since 2018.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the company emphasized continued evaluation of such transactions but introduced new risk language around potential insurer defaults and the company's residual liability in certain GAC structures.",
        "Step 3: The evolution reflects a shift from retrospective reporting of completed transactions to a more forward-looking and risk-aware strategic posture regarding pension risk transfers."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Postretirement Benefit Plans\n\n## Overview\n\nMany of our employees and retirees participate in qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans, retiree medical and life  insurance  plans  and  other  postemployment  plans  (collectively,  postretirement  benefit  plans  -  see  'Note  12  -  Postretirement Benefit Plans' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The majority of our accrued benefit obligations relate to our qualified defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans. We recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the net funded status of these postretirement benefit plans under GAAP as either an asset or a liability on our consolidated balance sheets. The GAAP funded status represents the difference between the fair value of each plan's assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. The GAAP benefit obligation represents the present value of the estimated future benefits we currently expect to pay to plan participants based on past service. The qualified defined benefit pension plans for salaried employees are fully frozen effective January 1, 2020 and our salaried employees participate in an enhanced defined contribution retirement savings plan.\n\nSimilar to recent years, we continue to take actions to mitigate the effect of our defined benefit pension plans on our financial results by reducing the volatility of our pension obligations, including entering into pension risk transfer transactions involving the purchase of group annuity contracts (GACs) for portions of our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations using assets from the pension trust. On August 3, 2021, we purchased GACs to transfer $4.9 billion of gross defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company for approximately 18,000 U.S. retirees and beneficiaries. The GACs were purchased using  assets  from  Lockheed  Martin's  master  retirement  trust  and  no  additional  funding  contribution  was  required  by  us.  This transaction had no impact on the amount, timing, or form of the monthly retirement benefit payments to the affected retirees and beneficiaries. In connection with this transaction, we recognized a noncash pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion ($1.3 billion, or $4.72 per share, after tax) for the affected defined benefit pension plans during the third quarter of 2021, which represents the accelerated  recognition  of  actuarial  losses  that  were  included  in  the  accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss  account  within stockholders' equity. As a result of this transaction, we were required to remeasure the benefit obligations and plan assets for the affected  defined  benefit  pension  plans  as  of  the  August  3,  2021  close  date.  The  purchase  of  the  GACs  and  the  pension remeasurement did not have an impact on our CAS pension cost and did not significantly impact our total FAS pension expense or net FAS/CAS pension adjustment in 2021, except for the noncash pension settlement charge.\n\nInclusive of the transaction described above, since December 2018, Lockheed Martin, through its master retirement trust, has purchased total contracts for approximately $11.6 billion related to our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations eliminating pension  plan  volatility  for  approximately  95,000  retirees  and  beneficiaries  and  annually  required  Pension  Benefit  Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) premiums of approximately $69 million per year.\n\nWe expect  to  continue  to  look  for  opportunities  to  manage  our  pension  liabilities  through  additional  pension  risk  transfer transactions in future years. Future transactions could result in a noncash settlement charge to earnings, which could be material to a reporting period.\n\nNotwithstanding  these  actions,  the  impact  of  our  postretirement  benefit  plans  on  our  earnings  may  be  volatile  in  that  the amount of expense we record and the funded status for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because the calculations are sensitive to funding levels as well as changes in several key economic assumptions, including interest rates, actual rates of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity and employee turnover, as well as the timing of cash funding.\n\n## Actuarial Assumptions\n\nThe benefit obligations and assets of our postretirement benefit plans are measured at the end of each year, or more frequently, upon the occurrence of certain events such as a significant plan amendment (including in connection with a pension risk transfer transaction), settlement or curtailment. The amounts we record are measured using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon key assumptions such as discount rates, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, participant longevity, and employee turnover.  The  assumptions  we  make  affect  both  the  calculation  of  the  benefit  obligations  as  of  the  measurement  date  and  the calculation  of  FAS  expense  in  subsequent  periods.  When  reassessing  these  assumptions,  we  consider  past  and  current  market conditions and make judgments about future market trends. We also consider factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants.\n\nWe continue to use a single weighted average discount rate approach when calculating our consolidated benefit obligations related to our defined benefit pension plans resulting in 2.875% at December 31, 2021, compared to 2.50% at December 31, 2020. We utilized a single weighted average discount rate of 2.75% when calculating our benefit obligations related to our",

      "question": "How did Lockheed Martin's approach to managing its nonqualified defined benefit pension plans evolve between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of pension obligation settlements and associated financial impacts?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Lockheed Martin purchased group annuity contracts to transfer $4.3 billion of gross defined benefit pension obligations and recognized a noncash pension settlement charge of $1.5 billion. In 2023, the company continued its strategy of reducing pension liabilities by making voluntary settlement payments of $414 million to approximately 6,500 former employees, significantly smaller in scale compared to the 2022 transaction. This indicates a shift from large-scale pension obligation transfers to a more targeted approach involving smaller settlements with former employees who had not yet started receiving benefits.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Lockheed Martin executed a major pension obligation transfer involving $4.3 billion in gross obligations and recognized a $1.5 billion noncash settlement charge.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the company shifted strategy to a more targeted approach, making $414 million in settlement payments to 6,500 former employees who had not yet commenced benefits.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a strategic evolution from large-scale annuity transfers in 2022 to smaller, more selective settlements in 2023, indicating a more measured and incremental approach to pension liability management."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Long-Term Debt\n\nIn September 2021, we repaid $500 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 3.35% according to their scheduled maturities.\n\nWe  made  interest  payments  of  approximately  $543  million,  $567  million  and  $625  million  during  the  years  ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## Note 12 - Postretirement Benefit Plans\n\n## Plan Descriptions\n\nMany of our employees and retirees participate in various postretirement benefit plans including defined benefit pension plans, retiree  medical  and  life  insurance  plans,  defined  contribution  retirement  savings  plans,  and  other  postemployment  plans. Substantially all of our postretirement benefit obligations relate to U.S. based defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans. The majority of our U.S. defined benefit pension plans provide for benefits within limits imposed by federal tax law (referred to as qualified plans). However, certain of our U.S. defined benefit pension plans provide for benefits in excess of qualified plan limits imposed by federal tax law (referred to as nonqualified plans).\n\nSalaried employees hired after December 31, 2005 are not eligible to participate in our qualified defined benefit pension plans, but are eligible to participate in a qualified defined contribution plan in addition to our other retirement savings plans. They also have the ability to participate in our retiree medical plans, but we do not subsidize the cost of their participation in those plans as we do with employees hired before January 1, 2006. Over the last few years, we have negotiated similar changes with various labor organizations such that new union represented employees do not participate in our defined benefit pension plans. Our qualified defined benefit pension plans for salaried employees were fully frozen effective January 1, 2020, at which time such employees no longer earn additional benefits under the defined benefit pension plans and were transitioned to an enhanced defined contribution retirement savings plan.\n\nOn August 3, 2021, we purchased group annuity contracts to transfer $4.9 billion of gross defined benefit pension obligations and  related  plan  assets  from  certain  of  our  qualified  defined  benefit  pension  plans  to  an  insurance  company  for  approximately 18,000 U.S. retirees and beneficiaries. The group annuity contracts were purchased using assets from Lockheed Martin's master retirement trust and no additional funding contribution was required by us. As a result of this transaction, we were relieved of all responsibility  for  these  pension  obligations  and  the  insurance  company  is  now  required  to  pay  and  administer  the  retirement benefits beginning on January 1, 2022. This transaction had no impact on the amount, timing, or form of the monthly retirement benefit payments to the affected retirees and beneficiaries. In connection with this transaction, we recognized a noncash pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion ($1.3 billion, or $4.72 per share, after tax) for the affected plans in 2021, which represents the accelerated recognition of actuarial losses that were included in the AOCL account within stockholders' equity.\n\nOn  December  3,  2020,  we  purchased  a  group  annuity  contract  to  transfer  $1.4  billion  of  gross  defined  benefit  pension obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company for approximately 13,500 U.S. retirees and beneficiaries. As a result of this transaction, we were relieved of all responsibility for these pension obligations and the insurance company is now required to pay and administer the retirement benefits. Although this transaction was treated as a settlement for accounting purposes, we were not required to recognize a settlement charge because the aggregate value of settlements for the affected plans in 2020 were less than each plan's service and interest cost.\n\nAlso on December 3, 2020, we purchased a group annuity contract pursuant to which an insurance company will reimburse the affected  qualified  defined  benefit  pension  plan  for  $793  million  of  gross  defined  benefit  pension  obligations  for  approximately 2,500 U.S. retirees and beneficiaries. Under the terms of the arrangement, the plan retains the obligation for paying the pension benefits to the covered retirees and beneficiaries and the insurance company will reimburse the plan as those benefits are paid. The group annuity contract provides us the option to transfer the defined benefit pension obligations to the insurance company at our discretion.  Because  the  plan  retains  the  obligation  for  paying  the  pension  benefits  to  the  covered  retirees  and  beneficiaries  this transaction was not treated as a settlement for accounting purpose and we were not required to recognize a settlement charge.",

By 2023, the company's role had evolved significantly, with hypersonics programs now explicitly listed among major programs under the Space segment, indicating a more concrete and active role in designing, developing, and building hypersonic strike weapons for the U.S. Army and Navy. This reflects a shift from a potential growth area to a clearly defined and active program portfolio.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nsubsequent events, changed circumstances, changes in expectations, or the estimates and assumptions associated with them. The forward-looking  statements  in  this  Form  10-K  are  intended  to  be  subject  to  the  safe  harbor  protection  provided  by  the  federal securities laws.\n\n## ITEM  1A.    Risk Factors\n\nAn  investment  in  our  common  stock  or  debt  securities  involves  risks  and  uncertainties.  We  seek  to  identify,  manage  and mitigate risks to our business, but risk and uncertainty cannot be eliminated or necessarily predicted. The outcome of one or more of these risks could have a material effect on our operating results, financial position, or cash flows. You should carefully consider the  following  factors,  in  addition  to  the  other  information  contained  in  this Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K,  before  deciding  to purchase our common stock or debt securities.\n\n## Risks Related to our Reliance on Government Contracts\n\nWe  depend  heavily  on  contracts  with  the  U.S.  Government  for  a  substantial  portion  of  our  business.  Changes  in  the  U.S. Government's priorities, or delays or reductions in spending could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe derived 71% of our total consolidated net sales from the U.S. Government in 2021, including 62% from the DoD. We expect  to  continue  to  derive  most  of  our  sales  from  work  performed  under  U.S.  Government  contracts.  Those  contracts  are conditioned upon the continuing availability of Congressional appropriations. Congress usually appropriates funds on a fiscal year (FY)  basis  even  though  contract  performance  may  extend  over  many  years.  Consequently,  contracts  are  often  partially  funded initially and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations over time. If we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on a contract or in advance of a contract award, we may be at risk of not being reimbursed for those costs unless and until additional funds are obligated under the contract or the contract is awarded and funded.\n\nBudget  uncertainty,  the  risk  of  future  budget  cuts,  the  potential  for  U.S.  Government  shutdowns,  the  use  of  continuing resolutions, and the federal debt ceiling can adversely affect our industry and the funding for our programs. If appropriations were delayed or a government shutdown were to occur and were to continue for an extended period of time, we could be at risk of program cancellations and other disruptions and nonpayment. When the U.S. Government operates under a continuing resolution, new contract  and  program  starts  are  restricted  and  funding  for  our  programs  may  be  unavailable,  reduced  or  delayed.  Shifting funding priorities  or  federal  budget  compromises,  could  also  result  in  reductions  in  overall  defense  spending  on  an  absolute  or inflation-adjusted basis, which could adversely impact our business. Our business could also be adversely impacted by reductions or delays in spending by non-U.S. government customers who are facing budget pressures.\n\nWe believe our diverse range of products and services generally make it less likely that cuts in any specific contract or program will  affect  our  business  on  a  long-term  basis.  However,  termination  of  multiple  or  large  programs  or  contracts  could  adversely affect  our  business  and  future  financial  performance.  Changes  in  funding  priorities  could  also  reduce  opportunities  in  existing programs and in future programs where we intend to compete. While we would expect to compete and be well positioned as the incumbent  on  existing  programs,  we  may  not  be  successful  and,  even  if  we  are  successful,  the  replacement  programs  may  be funded at lower levels. In addition, our ability to grow in key areas such as hypersonics programs, classified programs and nextgeneration franchise programs will also be affected by the overall budget environment, whether development programs transition to production and the timing of such transition, all of which are dependent on U.S. Government authorization and funding.\n\nThe F-35 program comprises a material portion of our revenue and reductions in funding for this program and risks related to the development, production, sustainment, performance, schedule, cost and requirements of the program could adversely affect our performance.\n\nThe F-35 program, which consists of multiple development, production and sustainment contracts, is our largest program and represented  27%  of  our  total  consolidated  net  sales  in  2021. A  decision  by  the  U.S.  Government  or  other  governments  to  cut spending  on  this  program  or  reduce  or  delay  planned  orders  would  have  an  adverse  impact  on  our  business  and  results  of operations. Given the size and complexity of the F-35 program, we anticipate that there will be continual reviews related to aircraft performance, program schedule, cost, and requirements as part of the DoD, Congressional, and international countries' oversight and  budgeting  processes.  Current  program  challenges  include  supplier,  Lockheed  Martin  and  partner  performance  (including COVID-19 performance-related challenges), software development, the receipt of funding for contracts on a timely basis, execution of  future  flight  tests  and  findings  resulting  from  testing  and  operating  the  aircraft,  the  level  of  cost  associated  with  life  cycle operations, sustainment and potential contractual obligations, and the ability to continue to reduce the unit production costs and improve affordability.",

      "answer": "In 2023, GE reported a $5.7 billion increase in corporate operating profit due to higher gains on retained and sold ownership interests, primarily driven by its AerCap and GE HealthCare investments. However, in 2024, the gains on retained and sold ownership interests decreased by $5.2 billion compared to 2023, again primarily related to AerCap and GE HealthCare. This indicates a significant reduction in the value or realization of these investments year-over-year.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, GE's corporate operating profit was positively impacted by $5.7 billion in gains from retained and sold ownership interests, with AerCap being a key contributor.",

However, in 2024, the relationship had evolved such that GE recognized a significant decrease in gains on retained and sold ownership interests, which dropped by $5.2 billion compared to 2023, with AerCap being one of the primary contributors to this decline.

      "question": "How has the strategic positioning of the CH-53K King Stallion heavy lift helicopter evolved within Lockheed Martin's Rotary and Mission Systems segment from 2023 to 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, the CH-53K King Stallion heavy lift helicopter was described as part of Lockheed Martin's near-to-mid-term growth elements, specifically under the Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) segment, alongside radar surveillance systems. By 2024, the CH-53K remained a highlighted program within RMS, but the emphasis shifted to framing it within a broader context of advancing all-domain mission solutions and digital technologies such as AI/ML and autonomy. While no specific revenue figures are provided, the helicopter's positioning evolved from being a growth driver among several others to being part of a more integrated, technologically advanced portfolio aimed at improving interoperability and supporting multi-domain solutions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, the CH-53K was identified as part of RMS's growth initiatives, listed alongside radar surveillance systems as entering growth stages.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the CH-53K was still a key RMS program but was contextualized within a broader strategic push toward digital transformation and all-domain mission solutions.",
        "Step 3: The helicopter\u2019s role remained important but was repositioned to align with Lockheed Martin\u2019s evolving strategic focus on advanced technologies and integrated defense systems."

Finally, we are always in pursuit of new program awards to develop future platforms that enable us to continue to strengthen our national defense and advance deterrence and global security. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\nKeys  to  enabling  success  of  our  strategy  include  developing  and  investing  in  differentiating  technologies,  forging  strategic  partnerships,  including  with commercial companies, executing on our multi-year business transformation initiative to enhance our digital infrastructure and increase efficiencies and collaboration throughout our business and maintaining fiscal discipline. Underpinning our ability to execute our strategy is our talent and culture. We invest substantially in our people to ensure that our workforce has the technical skills necessary to succeed, and we expect to continue to invest internally in innovative technologies that address rapidly evolving mission requirements for our customers. We also will continue to evaluate our portfolio and will make strategic acquisitions or divestitures, as appropriate, while deepening our connection to commercial industry through cooperative partnerships, joint ventures and equity investments.\n\n## Business Segments\n\nWe operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered.\n\n## Aeronautics\n\nAeronautics  is  engaged  in  the  research,  design,  development,  manufacture,  integration,  sustainment,  support  and  upgrade  of  advanced  military  aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Aeronautics also has contracts with the U.S. G overnment for various classified programs. Aeronautics' major programs include:\n\n- F-35 Lightning II - international multi-role, multi-variant, fifth generation stealth fighter.\n- C-130 Hercules - international tactical airlifter.\n- F-16 Fighting Falcon - combat-proven, international multi-role fighter.\n- F-22 Raptor - air dominance and multi-role fifth generation stealth fighter.\n\n## PART I",

      "answer": "In 2023, Lockheed Martin projected $1,860 million in payments for qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2025 and $10,020 million over the period from 2029 to 2033. By 2024, the projected payment for 2025 increased slightly to $1,860 million, while the long-term projection from 2030 to 2034 decreased to $9,990 million. This indicates a marginal reduction in long-term pension obligations.",

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## Risk Management Policies\n\nChanges in fuel prices, interest rates and foreign currency ex change rates impact our results of operations and we actively monitor these exposures. Where deemed appropriate, to manage the impact of these exposures on earnings and/or cash flows, we may enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\n\n## Credit Risk Management\n\nThe forward contracts, swaps and options discussed below contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. We seek to minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines. We may further manage credit risk through the use of bilateral collateral provisions and/or early termination rights utilizing master netting arrangements, whereby cash is exchanged based on the net fair value of derivatives associated with each counterparty when positions exceed certain amounts. During 2024, the terms of these arrangements were revised to include a threshold of $250 million.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we did not hold any cash collateral. As of December 31, 2023, we held cash collateral of $103 million under these agreements. Collateral is included in Cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheets and is unrestricted. As of December 31, 2024, no collateral was required to be posted with our counterparties. As of December 31, 2023, we were required to post $13 million of collateral with our counterparties.\n\n## Types of Hedges\n\n## Commodity Risk Management\n\nCurrently, the fuel surcharges that we apply in our domestic and international package businesses are the primary means of reducing the risk of adverse fuel price changes on our business. In order to mitigate the impact of fuel surcharges imposed on us by outside carriers, we regularly adjust the rates we charge for our freight brokerage services.\n\n## Foreign Currency Risk Management\n\nTo protect against the reduction in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flows from our international package business, we maintain a foreign currency cash flow hedging program. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Chinese Renminbi and Hong Kong Dollar. We generally designate and account for these contracts as cash flow hedges of anticipated foreign currency denominated revenue.\n\nWe may also hedge portions of our anticipated cash settlements of principal and interest on certain foreign currency denominated debt. We generally designate and account for these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions.\n\nWe hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations with foreign currency denominated debt instruments.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk Management\n\nWe may use a combination of derivative instruments to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing.\n\nWe generally designate and account for interest rate swaps that convert fixed-rate interest payments into floating-rate interest payments as fair value hedges of the associated debt instruments. We designate and account for interest rate swaps that convert floating-rate interest payments into fixed-rate interest payments as cash flow hedges of the forecasted payment obligations.\n\nWe may periodically hedge the forecasted fixed-coupon interest payments associated with anticipated debt offerings by using forward starting interest rate swaps, interest rate locks or similar derivatives.",

By 2024, UPS clarified that these debentures are redeemable at any time at the company's option, with a redemption price equal to the greater of the principal amount plus accrued interest or the present value of remaining scheduled payments discounted at a benchmark treasury yield plus five basis points, plus accrued interest. Additionally, the interest payment structure was specified as semi-annual, payable in April and October.

      "answer": "In 2022, UPS emphasized its integrated global air and ground network as the foundation for time-definite delivery services, highlighting its ability to combine all packages within a single network for operational efficiency. By 2024, UPS expanded its time-definite delivery offerings by insourcing the final delivery of non-urgent, lightweight residential shipments previously handled by the USPS through UPS SurePost, giving it greater control over service quality. Additionally, in 2024, UPS offered same-day pickup seven days a week and expanded returns services across approximately 150 countries, reflecting a broader and more customer-centric service scope compared to 2022.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, UPS described its time-definite delivery services as supported by a single, globally integrated smart logistics network that combined all package types for efficiency.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, UPS introduced specific enhancements, including the insourcing of UPS SurePost deliveries starting in 2025 and expanded same-day pickup and returns services across 150 countries.",
        "Step 3: The evolution reflects a strategic shift from network integration as a core differentiator (2022) to greater control over delivery execution and broader service offerings (2024), indicating a transformation in service scope and delivery control."

          "chunk_text": "## Competitive Strengths\n\nOur competitive strengths include:\n\nGlobal Smart Logistics Network. We believe that our integrated global air and ground network is the most extensive in the industry. We provide all types of package services (air, ground, domestic, international, commercial and residential) through a single pickup and delivery network. Our sophisticated engineering systems allow us to optimize network efficiency and asset utilization.\n\nGlobal Presence. We serve more than 220 countries and territories. We have a significant presence in all of the world's major economies, allowing us to effectively and efficiently operate around the world.\n\nCutting-Edge Technologies. We are a global leader in developing technologies that help our customers enhance their shipping and logistics business processes to lower costs, improve service and increase efficiency. We offer a variety of online tools that enable our customers to integrate UPS functionality into their own websites, deepening our customer relationships. These tools allow customers to send, manage and track their shipments, and also to provide their customers with better information services.\n\nA Broad Portfolio of Services. Our portfolio of services helps customers choose their most appropriate delivery option. Increasingly, our customers benefit from UPS business solutions that integrate our services beyond package delivery. For example, supply chain services - such as freight forwarding, truckload brokerage, customs brokerage, order fulfillment and returns management - help improve the efficiency of our customers' entire supply chain management process.\n\nCustomer Relationships. We focus on building and maintaining long-term customer relationships. Providing value-added services beyond package delivery, and cross-selling small package and supply chain services across our customer base, are important retention tools and growth mechanisms for us.\n\nBrand Equity. We have built a leading and trusted brand that stands for quality, reliability and service innovation. Our vehicles and the professional courtesy of our drivers are major contributors to our brand equity.\n\nDistinctive Culture. We believe that the dedication of our employees comes in large part from our distinctive 'employeeowner' culture. Our founders believed that employee stock ownership was a vital foundation for successful business, and the employee stock ownership tradition dates back to our first stock ownership program in 1927. Our legacy of fairness and equity is the bedrock of our culture and of our relationships with those we serve.\n\nFinancial Strength. Our financial strength allows us to generate value for our shareowners by investing in technology, transportation equipment, facilities and employee development; pursuing strategic opportunities that facilitate our growth and maintaining a strong credit rating that gives us flexibility in running the business.\n\n## Products and Services; Reporting Segments\n\nWe have two reporting segments: U.S. Domestic Package and International Package. Our remaining businesses are reported as Supply Chain Solutions. U.S. Domestic Package and International Package are together referred to as our global small package operations.\n\n## Global Small Package\n\nOur global small package operations provide time-definite delivery services for express letters, documents, packages and palletized freight via air and ground services. These services are supported by numerous shipping, visibility and billing technologies. For example, our Digital Access Program makes it easier for SMBs to use our services by embedding our shipping solutions directly into leading e-commerce platforms.\n\nAll services (air, ground, domestic, international, commercial and residential) are managed through a single, global smart logistics network. We combine all packages within our network, unless dictated by specific service commitments. This enables us to efficiently pick up customers' shipments for any services at a scheduled time each day. Our integrated network provides unique operational and capital efficiencies that have a lower environmental impact than single service network designs.",

UPS drivers can also directly accept packages.\n\nWe offer a portfolio of returns services in approximately 150 countries.

Through 2024, final delivery was often provided by the United States Postal Service (\"USPS\"). Beginning January 1, 2025, in order to have more control over our ability to provide our customers industry-leading service, we have insourced this product. For additional information, see 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations'.\n\n## International Package\n\nInternational Package consists of our small package operations in Europe, the Indian sub-continent, Middle East and Africa (together \"EMEA\"), Canada and Latin America (together \"Americas\") and Asia.

Serving more than 200 countries and territories, we strategically seek to provide integration across increasingly complex, specialized and fragmented supply chains.\n\n## Forwarding\n\nWe are one of the largest U.S. domestic airfreight carriers and airfreight forwarders globally. We offer a portfolio of guaranteed and non-guaranteed global airfreight services. Additionally, as one of the world's leading non-vessel operating common carriers, we provide ocean freight full container load, less-than-container load and multimodal transportation services between most major ports around the world. We also provide customs brokerage as well as various related services.\n\nIn September 2024, we completed the divestiture of our truckload brokerage business (\"Coyote\").

Supply chain complexity creates demand for a global service offering that incorporates transportation, distribution and international trade and brokerage services, with complementary financial and information services. Many companies see value in outsourcing non-core logistics activity. With increased competition and growth opportunities in new markets, businesses require flexible and responsive supply chains to support their strategies. We meet this demand by offering a broad array of supply chain services in more than 200 countries and territories.\n\nThe divestiture of UPS Freight was completed on April 30, 2021. As a result of the divestiture, we renamed Supply Chain &amp; Freight as Supply Chain Solutions. For additional information on the divestiture, see note 4 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Forwarding\n\nWe are one of the largest U.S. domestic air freight carriers and among the top air freight forwarders globally. We offer a portfolio of guaranteed and non-guaranteed global air freight services. Additionally, as one of the world's leading non-vessel operating common carriers, we provide ocean freight full-container load, less-than-container load and multimodal transportation services between most major ports around the world.\n\n## Truckload Brokerage\n\nWe provide truckload brokerage services in the U.S. and Europe through our Coyote-branded subsidiaries. Access to the UPS fleet, combined with a broad third-party carrier network, creates customized capacity solutions for all markets and customers. Coyote customers can also access UPS services such as air freight, customs brokerage and global freight forwarding.\n\n## Logistics &amp; Distribution\n\nOur Logistics &amp; Distribution business provides value-added fulfillment and transportation management services. We leverage a network of more than 1,000 facilities in over 120 countries to ensure products and parts are in the right place at the right time. We operate both multi-client and dedicated facilities across our network, many of which are strategically located near UPS air and ground transportation hubs to support rapid delivery to consumer and business markets.\n\nHealthcare logistics is one of our targeted areas for growth. We offer world-class technology, deep expertise and the most sophisticated suite of services in the industry. With a strategic focus on serving the unique, priority-handling needs of healthcare and life sciences customers, we have increased our cold-chain logistics capabilities to support the rapid deployment of COVID-19 vaccines both in the U.S. and internationally and we have delivered over one billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n## Customs Brokerage\n\nWe are among the world's largest customs brokers, as measured by both the number of shipments processed annually and by the number of dedicated brokerage employees worldwide. In addition to customs clearance services, we provide product classification, trade management, duty drawback and consulting services.\n\n## Roadie\n\nOn October 1, 2021, we acquired Roadie, a technology platform that enables local same-day delivery with operations throughout the United States. The Roadie technology platform is purpose-built to connect merchants and consumers with contract drivers to enable efficient and scalable same-day local delivery services, including items that are not compatible with the UPS network.\n\n## UPS Capital\n\nUPS Capital offers integrated supply chain insurance solutions for in-transit goods to both small and large businesses. UPS Capital also offers insured transportation of high value goods.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nFit to Serve: In 2023, a number of factors, including macroeconomic headwinds and volume diversion resulting from our labor negotiations with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, contributed to volume declines in our U.S. Domestic Package business. In addition, our International Package and Supply Chain Solutions businesses were also negatively impacted by a number of challenging macroeconomic conditions during 2023. In response to these factors, we began to undertake our Fit to Serve initiative with the intent to right-size our business to create a more efficient operating model that was more responsive to market dynamics through a workforce reduction of approximately 14,000 positions, primarily within management, throughout 2024. We have incurred total costs of $416 million under Fit to Serve, which primarily consist of benefit costs related to reductions in our workforce. We expect to complete this initiative during 2025 with ex pected remaining costs of approximately $45 million. We achieved savings of approximately $1.0 billion in 2024 through reductions in our compensation and benefit expense.\n\nNetwork Reconfiguration and Efficiency Reimagined : On January 30, 2025, in connection with our agreement in principle with our largest customer, we announced a network reconfiguration which is expected to lead to consolidations of our facilities and workforce as well as end-to-end process redesign from 2025 through 2027. Our network reconfiguration is expected to result in exit activities that could result in the closure of up to 10% of our buildings in 2025, a reduction in the size of our vehicle and aircraft fleets, and a decrease in the size of our workforce. The costs directly associated with these ex it activities are in addition to operational costs that we may incur. We are not yet able to determine the specific assets or extent of our workforce that will be impacted by our network redesign, the timing of those future changes or the associated charges we will incur and therefore are not currently able to provide an estimate of the total cost or the cost by period. We expect that impacted assets will remain in use during some or all of the periods of our network reconfiguration.\n\nWe expect to partially offset costs to complete our network reconfiguration through end-to-end process redesign carried out during our network reconfiguration through our Efficiency Reimagined initiatives. These initiatives are being undertaken to align our organizational processes to the operational changes expected to occur in our network reconfiguration and drive organizational efficiency. These initiatives are expected to yield approximately $1.0 billion in annualized savings beginning in 2025. We incurred related costs of $35 million in the year ended December 31, 2024. We expect to incur related costs of approximately $300 to $400 million during 2025, and incremental costs in 2026 and 2027, to complete the program which will primarily consist of outside professional services and severance costs. Upon the completion of our network reconfiguration and Efficiency Reimagined initiatives, we ex pect to realize further benefits in subsequent periods from lower expense, including depreciation, compensation and benefits, as well as lower capital requirements.\n\nWe do not consider the related costs to be ordinary because each program involves separate and distinct activities that may span multiple periods and are not expected to drive incremental revenue, and because the scope of the programs exceeds that of routine, ongoing efforts to enhance profitability. These initiatives are in addition to ordinary, ongoing efforts to enhance our business performance.\n\nFor more information regarding transformation strategy activities, see note 18 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Gain on Divestiture of Coyote\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, we completed the previously announced divestiture of Coyote. In connection therewith, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $156 million ($152 million after tax ) during the year ended December 31, 2024. The gain was recognized within Other expenses in the statements of consolidated income. We supplement the presentation of operating profit, operating margin, income before income taxes, net income and earnings per share with non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of this gain as it is not a component of our ongoing operations and is not expected to recur. For more information regarding the gain on divestiture of Coyote, see note 8 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\n\n## One-Time Payment for International Regulatory Matter\n\nIn the second quarter of 2024, we made a payment of $94 million of previously restricted cash to settle a previously-disclosed challenge by Italian tax authorities to the deductibility of V alue Added Tax payments by UPS to certain third-party service providers. We supplement the presentation of operating profit, operating margin, interest ex pense, total other income and (ex pense), income before income taxes, net income and earnings per share with non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of this payment. We do not believe this is a component of our ongoing operations and we do not expect this or similar payments to recur.",

Under this agreement, the Company's principal obligations include (i) evaluating releases of certain PFAS compounds from these sites and proposing response actions; (ii) providing treatment or alternative drinking water upon identifying any level exceeding a HBV or Health Risk Limit (HRL) (i.e., the amount of a chemical in drinking water determined by the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) to be safe for human consumption over a lifetime) for certain PFAS compounds for which a HBV and/or HRL exists as a result of contamination from these sites; (iii) remediating identified sources of other PFAS compounds at these sites that are not controlled by actions to remediate PFOA and PFOS; and (iv) sharing information with the MPCA about certain perfluorinated compounds. During 2008, the MPCA issued formal decisions adopting remedial options for the former disposal sites in Washington County, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury). In August 2009, the MPCA issued a formal decision adopting remedial options for the Company's Cottage Grove manufacturing facility. During the spring and summer of 2010, 3M began implementing the agreed upon remedial options at the Cottage Grove and Woodbury sites. 3M commenced the remedial option at the Oakdale site in late 2010. At each location the remedial options were recommended by the Company and approved by the MPCA. The Company has completed remediation work and continues with operational and maintenance activities at the Oakdale and Woodbury sites. Remediation work has been substantially completed at the Cottage Grove site, with operational and maintenance activities ongoing.\n\nIn Alabama, as previously reported, the Company entered into a voluntary remedial action agreement with ADEM to remediate the presence of PFAS in the soil and groundwater at the Company's manufacturing facility in Decatur, Alabama associated with the historic (1978-1998) incorporation of wastewater treatment plant sludge. With ADEM's agreement, 3M substantially completed installation of a multilayer cap on the former sludge incorporation areas. Further remediation activities, including certain on-site and off-site investigations and studies, will be conducted in accordance with the July 2020 Interim Consent Order described below.\n\nThe Company operates under a 2009 consent order issued under the federal Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) (the '2009 TSCA consent order') for the manufacture and use of two perfluorinated materials (FBSA and FBSEE) at its Decatur, Alabama site that does not permit release of these materials into 'the waters of the United States.' In March 2019, the Company halted the manufacture, processing, and use of these materials at the site upon learning that these materials may have been released from certain specified processes at the Decatur site into the Tennessee River. In April 2019, the Company voluntarily disclosed the releases to the U.S. EPA and ADEM. During June and July 2019, the Company took steps to fully control the aforementioned processes by capturing all wastewater produced by the processes and by treating all air emissions. These processes have been back on-line and in operation since July 2019. The Company continues to cooperate with the EPA and ADEM in their investigations and will work with the regulatory authorities to demonstrate compliance with the release restrictions.\n\nThe Company is authorized to discharge wastewater from its Decatur plant pursuant to the terms of a Clean Water Act National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit issued by ADEM. The NPDES permit requires the Company to report on a monthly and quarterly basis the quality and quantity of pollutants discharged to the Tennessee River. In June 2019, as previously reported, the Company voluntarily disclosed to the EPA and ADEM that it had included incorrect values in certain of its monthly and quarterly reports. The Company has submitted the corrected values to both the EPA and ADEM.\n\nAs previously reported, as part of ongoing work with the EPA and ADEM to address compliance matters at the Decatur facility, the Company discovered it had not fully characterized its PFAS discharge in its NPDES permit. In September 2019, the Company disclosed the matter to the EPA and ADEM and announced that it had elected to temporarily idle certain other manufacturing processes at 3M Decatur. The Company is reviewing its operations at the plant, has installed wastewater treatment controls and has restarted idled processes.\n\nAs a result of the Company's discussions with ADEM to address these and other related matters in the state of Alabama, as previously reported, 3M and ADEM agreed to the terms of an interim Consent Order in July 2020 to cover all PFAS-related wastewater discharges and air emissions from the Company's Decatur facility. Under the interim Consent Order, the Company's principal obligations include commitments related to (i) future ongoing site operations such as (a) providing certain notices or reports and performing various analytical and characterization studies and (b) future capital improvements; and (ii) remediation activities, including certain on-site and off-site investigations and studies. Obligations related to ongoing future site operations under the Consent Order will involve additional operating costs and capital expenditures over multiple years. As offsite investigation activities continue, additional remediation amounts may become probable and reasonably estimable in the future.",

The Company continues to work with the EPA and IEPA. IEPA has not acted on the pending application.\n\nIn November 2022, the Company entered into an Administrative Consent Order under the Safe Drinking Water Act (\"SDWA\") that requires the Company to continue to sample and survey private and public drinking water wells within the vicinity of the Cordova facility, provide treatment of private water wells within a three-mile radius of the Cordova facility, and to provide alternate treatment/supply for the Camanche, Iowa public drinking water system. The Company continues to work with EPA and the City of Camanche as it implements the SDWA Administrative Consent Order.\n\nIn April 2022, the Company received a TSCA information request from EPA seeking information related to the operation of specific PFAS-related processes at the Cordova facility. The Company has completed its production of documents and information and is cooperating with this inquiry.\n\nIn May 2022, the Company received a notice of potential violation and opportunity to confer and a notice of intent to file a complaint from EPA alleging violations of RCRA related to the use of tanks associated with certain chemical processes at the Cordova facility. While not admitting to the alleged violations, the Company elected to resolve the matter by entering into a Consent Agreement and Final Order with EPA in September 2024. As part of the settlement, the Company agreed to pay an immaterial penalty. In July 2023, 3M received from the EPA a draft for discussion of a consent order under RCRA. That order would require 3M to conduct an investigation to determine the nature and extent of PFAS contamination at and around its Cordova facility, among other items. In January 2025, the Company reached an agreement with the EPA on the terms of the consent order.\n\nIn March 2024, the Company received an information request from EPA seeking information related to the implementation of the Cordova facility's Clean Air Act section 122(r) risk management program. In May 2024, EPA conducted an on-site inspection at the Cordova facility as part of its 112(r) risk management program investigation. The Company has completed its production of information and documents responsive to the information request.\n\n## Decatur, Alabama\n\nIn Alabama, as previously disclosed, the Company entered into a voluntary remedial action agreement with the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) to remediate the presence of PFAS in the soil and groundwater at the Company's manufacturing facility in Decatur, Alabama. With ADEM's agreement, 3M substantially completed installation of a multilayer cap on the former sludge incorporation areas.\n\nAs previously disclosed, the Company operates under a 2009 consent order issued under the federal TSCA (the '2009 TSCA consent order') for the manufacture and use of two perfluorinated materials (FBSA and FBSEE) at the Decatur site that prohibits release of these materials into 'the waters of the United States.' In March 2019, the Company halted the manufacture, processing, and use of these materials at the site upon learning that these materials may have been released from certain specified processes at the Decatur site into the Tennessee River. In April 2019, the Company voluntarily disclosed the releases to the U.S. EPA and ADEM. During June and July 2019, the Company took steps to fully control the aforementioned processes by capturing all wastewater produced by the processes and treating all air emissions. These processes are no longer in use.\n\nThe Company is authorized to discharge wastewater from its Decatur plant pursuant to an NPDES permit issued by ADEM. In June 2019, as previously reported, the Company voluntarily disclosed to the EPA and ADEM that it had included incorrect values in certain of its monthly and quarterly reports. The Company has submitted the corrected values to both the EPA and ADEM. In addition, as previously reported, the Company discovered it had not fully characterized its PFAS discharge in its NPDES permit. In September 2019, the Company disclosed the matter to the EPA and ADEM and temporarily idled certain manufacturing processes at 3M Decatur. An application to add the additional PFAS to its NPDES permit was submitted to ADEM and the Company installed additional wastewater treatment controls to address PFAS. The wastewater controls are currently being upgraded and optimized. ADEM has not acted on the request to modify the NPDES permit.\n\nAs previously reported, in December 2019, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Alabama for documents related to, among other matters, the Company's compliance with the 2009 TSCA consent order and unpermitted discharges to the Tennessee River from its Decatur facility. The Company continues to cooperate with the U.S. Attorney's Office, the U.S. Department of Justice and the EPA with respect to this issue.",

      "answer": "The Deferred Stock Unit Award Agreement for non-employee directors was first referenced in the 2022 10-K filing as part of the 3M Company 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan, applicable to grants on or after January 1, 2019. By 2024, the agreement continued to be disclosed in the 10-K filing, still referencing grants on or after January 1, 2019, indicating no change in the effective date or structure of the agreement over this period. However, the 2024 disclosure reflects an updated incorporation by reference from the 2023 10-K, showing the ongoing maintenance of the plan through amendments as of May 8, 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, the Deferred Stock Unit Award Agreement was disclosed in the 10-K for grants on or after January 1, 2019, indicating its applicability and incorporation from the 2018 10-K.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the same Deferred Stock Unit Award Agreement remained in place for grants on or after January 1, 2019, but was now incorporated by reference from the 2023 10-K, which included amendments through May 8, 2023.",
        "Step 3: The agreement itself did not change in terms or effective dates, but the incorporation reference was updated to reflect the most recent plan amendments, indicating procedural continuity rather than structural change."

      "answer": "In 2022, 3M had a significant amount of fixed rate registered notes, including $600 million of 10-year notes due 2030 with a coupon rate of 3.05%, and $650 million of 30-year notes due 2050 with a coupon rate of 3.70%. The company also issued $3.25 billion in fixed rate registered notes in August 2019, including $1.0 billion of 10-year notes due 2029 and $1.0 billion of 30-year notes due 2049. In 2024, 3M repaid $1.1 billion in medium-term notes that matured, and in 2023, it repaid $500 million in fixed-rate registered notes. Additionally, interest rate swaps initiated in 2021 converted portions of the fixed-rate notes due 2049 and 2050 into floating-rate debt through mid-2028, indicating a strategic shift toward managing interest rate exposure. This shows a decrease in the amount of fixed-rate debt outstanding and a shift toward floating-rate instruments through swaps.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, 3M had a large portfolio of fixed rate registered notes, including significant long-term notes due in 2030, 2049, and 2050.",

        "Step 3: The change reflects a strategic evolution from a fixed-rate debt-heavy structure to a more flexible floating-rate approach, reducing long-term fixed interest obligations and managing exposure to changing market rates."

During the third quarter of 2020, the Company paid the outstanding balances and closed these credit facilities.\n\nThe Company also had an additional $266 million in stand-alone letters of credit and bank guarantees issued and outstanding at December 31, 2021. These instruments are utilized in connection with normal business activities.\n\n## Long-Term Debt Issuances and Fixed-to-Floating Interest Rate Swaps\n\nThe principal amounts, interest rates and maturity dates of individual long-term debt issuances can be found in the long-term debt table found at the beginning of this note.\n\nDuring the second and third quarters of 2021, 3M entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $800 million. These swaps converted $500 million and $300 million of 3M's $1.0 billion and $650 million principal amount of fixed rate notes due 2049 and 2050, respectively, into floating rate debt for the portion of their terms through mid-2028 with an interest rate based on a three-month LIBOR index.\n\nIn March 2020, 3M issued $1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed rate registered notes. These were comprised of $500 million of 5-year notes due 2025 with a coupon rate of 2.65%, $600 million of 10-year notes due 2030 with a coupon rate of 3.05%, and $650 million of 30-year notes due 2050 with a coupon rate of 3.70%.\n\nIn February 2019, 3M issued $2.25 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed rate medium-term notes.

Issuances of the 5-year and 29.5-year notes were pursuant to a reopening of existing securities issued in September 2018.\n\nIn August 2019, 3M issued $3.25 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed rate registered notes. These were comprised of $500 million of 3.5-year notes due 2023 with a coupon rate of 1.75%, $750 million of 5.5-year notes due 2025 with a coupon rate of 2.00%, $1.0 billion of 10-year notes due 2029 with a coupon rate of 2.375%, and $1.0 billion of 30-year notes due 2049 with a coupon rate of 3.25%.\n\n## Long-Term Debt Maturities and Extinguishments\n\nIn November 2021, 3M repaid 600 million euros aggregate principal amount of Eurobonds that matured.\n\nIn March 2021, 3M, via a make-whole-call offer, redeemed $450 million principal amount of 2.75% notes due 2022. The Company recorded an early debt extinguishment pre-tax charge of approximately $11 million within interest expense. This charge reflected the differential between the carrying value and the amount paid to reacquire the notes and related expenses.\n\nIn December 2020, 3M, via make-whole-call offers, repaid $1 billion aggregate principal amount of its outstanding notes. This included $400 million aggregate principal amount of 3.00% notes and $600 million aggregate principal amount of 1.625% notes, both of which were due to mature in 2021. The Company recorded an early debt extinguishment pre-tax charge of approximately $10 million within interest expense. This charge reflected the differential between the carrying value and the amount paid to reacquire the notes and related expenses.\n\nIn May 2020, 3M repaid 650 million euros aggregate principal amount of floating-rate medium-term notes that matured. In August 2020, 3M repaid $500 aggregate principal amount of floating rate medium-term notes that matured.\n\nIn June 2019, 3M repaid $625 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate medium-term notes that matured.\n\nIn 2019, 3M also assumed approximately $2.6 billion of debt in connection with the acquisitions of Acelity and M*Modal (See Note 3) of which $2.1 billion was immediately redeemed or paid at close.\n\n## In-Substance Defeasance\n\nIn conjunction with the October 2019 acquisition of Acelity (see Note 3), 3M assumed outstanding debt of the business, of which $445 million in principal amount of third lien senior secured notes (Third Lien Notes) maturing in 2021 with a coupon rate of 12.5% was not immediately redeemed at closing.

The revolving credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to $1.0 billion (at lender's discretion), bringing the total facility up to $5.25 billion. The credit facility was undrawn at December 31, 2024. Under the $4.25 billion credit facility, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (based on amounts defined in the amended agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest ex pense on all funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2024, 3M was in compliance with this requirement. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends.\n\nOther Credit Facilities: The Company also had $0.5 billion in stand-alone letters of credit, bank guarantees, and other similar instruments issued and outstanding at December 31, 2024. These instruments are utilized in connection with normal business activities.\n\nSolventum Related Debt: In the first quarter of 2024, Solventum, prior to the Separation discussed in Note 2, issued a total of $8.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured debt and term loans. Also during the first quarter of 2024, Solventum further entered into a revolving credit facility of $2 billion which was undrawn as of March 31, 2024. These Solventum items were guaranteed by 3M until the completion of the Separation on April 1, 2024 and obligations under these notes, loans and facilities became, as transferred obligations, the sole responsibility of Solventum after the Separation.\n\nFixed-to-Floating Interest Rate Swaps: During 2021, 3M entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $800 million. These swaps converted $500 million and $300 million of 3M's $1 billion and $650 million principal amount of fix ed rate notes due 2049 and 2050, respectively, into floating rate debt for the portion of their terms through mid-2028 with an original interest rate based on a three-month LIBOR index, which since was amended to a rate based on a SOFR index.\n\nLong-Term Debt Maturities and Extinguishments: In 2024, 3M repaid $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes that matured.\n\nIn 2023, 3M repaid $500 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate registered notes that matured, $650 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate mediumterm notes that matured and 600 million euros aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate medium-term notes that matured.\n\nIn 2022, 3M repaid 500 million euros aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate medium-term notes that matured and $600 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate medium-term notes that matured.\n\nFloating Rate Notes: At various times, 3M has issued floating rate notes containing put provisions, amounting to $0.2 billion in total. 3M would be required to repurchase these securities at various prices ranging from 99 percent to 100 percent of par value according to the reduction schedules for each security. Under the terms of this floating rate note due in 2044, holders have an annual put feature at 100 percent of par value from 2014 and every anniversary thereafter until final maturity. Under the terms of the floating rate notes due in 2027, 2040 and 2041, holders have put options that commence ten years from the date of issuance and each third anniversary thereafter until final maturity at prices ranging from 99 percent to 100 percent of par value. For the periods presented, 3M was required to repurchase an immaterial amount of principal on the aforementioned floating rate notes.",

      "question": "How has 3M's regulatory engagement and remediation obligations related to PFAS discharge evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly in Minnesota and Alabama?",
      "answer": "In 2022, 3M was actively working under a 2007 Settlement Agreement and Consent Order with the MPCA to address PFAS contamination in Minnesota, with remediation substantially completed at the Cottage Grove site and ongoing operational and maintenance activities at multiple locations. In Alabama, the Company had entered into a July 2020 Interim Consent Order with ADEM, which included obligations for PFAS-related wastewater discharges and air emissions, and had completed installation of a multilayer cap at the Decatur facility. By 2024, regulatory scrutiny had intensified. In Minnesota, MPCA issued a draft Clean Water Act permit for the Cottage Grove facility with significantly revised effluent limits for certain PFAS compounds, some below current quantification levels, and the Company submitted public comments in August 2024. Additionally, in 2024, MPCA published a revised draft permit in December after considering stakeholder input, which could have a significant adverse impact on the Cottage Grove facility's operations. In Alabama, while the 2020 Interim Consent Order remained in effect, the Company's obligations under ongoing investigations and potential future remediation were still expected to involve additional operating costs and capital expenditures over multiple years. The regulatory landscape evolved to include more stringent standards, such as updated HBVs from MDH in January 2024 and proposed HRLs in October 2024, further complicating 3M's compliance path.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, 3M had completed remediation at key Minnesota sites and was operating under the 2020 Interim Consent Order in Alabama with defined remedial actions and reporting obligations.",
        "Step 2: By 2024, regulatory agencies had introduced more stringent standards (e.g., updated HBVs and proposed HRLs in Minnesota) and issued revised permits with tighter PFAS discharge limits, while new Notices of Violation were issued in Hutchinson, Minnesota.",
        "Step 3: The evolution reflects increased regulatory pressure and expanded compliance obligations, particularly in Minnesota, with more complex and costly remediation and permitting requirements emerging by 2024."

Under this agreement, the Company's principal obligations include (i) evaluating releases of certain PFAS compounds from these sites and proposing response actions; (ii) providing treatment or alternative drinking water upon identifying any level exceeding a HBV or Health Risk Limit (HRL) (i.e., the amount of a chemical in drinking water determined by the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) to be safe for human consumption over a lifetime) for certain PFAS compounds for which a HBV and/or HRL exists as a result of contamination from these sites; (iii) remediating identified sources of other PFAS compounds at these sites that are not controlled by actions to remediate PFOA and PFOS; and (iv) sharing information with the MPCA about certain perfluorinated compounds. During 2008, the MPCA issued formal decisions adopting remedial options for the former disposal sites in Washington County, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury). In August 2009, the MPCA issued a formal decision adopting remedial options for the Company's Cottage Grove manufacturing facility. During the spring and summer of 2010, 3M began implementing the agreed upon remedial options at the Cottage Grove and Woodbury sites. 3M commenced the remedial option at the Oakdale site in late 2010. At each location the remedial options were recommended by the Company and approved by the MPCA. The Company has completed remediation work and continues with operational and maintenance activities at the Oakdale and Woodbury sites. Remediation work has been substantially completed at the Cottage Grove site, with operational and maintenance activities ongoing.\n\nIn Alabama, as previously reported, the Company entered into a voluntary remedial action agreement with ADEM to remediate the presence of PFAS in the soil and groundwater at the Company's manufacturing facility in Decatur, Alabama associated with the historic (1978-1998) incorporation of wastewater treatment plant sludge. With ADEM's agreement, 3M substantially completed installation of a multilayer cap on the former sludge incorporation areas. Further remediation activities, including certain on-site and off-site investigations and studies, will be conducted in accordance with the July 2020 Interim Consent Order described below.\n\nThe Company operates under a 2009 consent order issued under the federal Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) (the '2009 TSCA consent order') for the manufacture and use of two perfluorinated materials (FBSA and FBSEE) at its Decatur, Alabama site that does not permit release of these materials into 'the waters of the United States.' In March 2019, the Company halted the manufacture, processing, and use of these materials at the site upon learning that these materials may have been released from certain specified processes at the Decatur site into the Tennessee River. In April 2019, the Company voluntarily disclosed the releases to the U.S. EPA and ADEM. During June and July 2019, the Company took steps to fully control the aforementioned processes by capturing all wastewater produced by the processes and by treating all air emissions. These processes have been back on-line and in operation since July 2019. The Company continues to cooperate with the EPA and ADEM in their investigations and will work with the regulatory authorities to demonstrate compliance with the release restrictions.\n\nThe Company is authorized to discharge wastewater from its Decatur plant pursuant to the terms of a Clean Water Act National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit issued by ADEM. The NPDES permit requires the Company to report on a monthly and quarterly basis the quality and quantity of pollutants discharged to the Tennessee River. In June 2019, as previously reported, the Company voluntarily disclosed to the EPA and ADEM that it had included incorrect values in certain of its monthly and quarterly reports. The Company has submitted the corrected values to both the EPA and ADEM.\n\nAs previously reported, as part of ongoing work with the EPA and ADEM to address compliance matters at the Decatur facility, the Company discovered it had not fully characterized its PFAS discharge in its NPDES permit. In September 2019, the Company disclosed the matter to the EPA and ADEM and announced that it had elected to temporarily idle certain other manufacturing processes at 3M Decatur. The Company is reviewing its operations at the plant, has installed wastewater treatment controls and has restarted idled processes.\n\nAs a result of the Company's discussions with ADEM to address these and other related matters in the state of Alabama, as previously reported, 3M and ADEM agreed to the terms of an interim Consent Order in July 2020 to cover all PFAS-related wastewater discharges and air emissions from the Company's Decatur facility. Under the interim Consent Order, the Company's principal obligations include commitments related to (i) future ongoing site operations such as (a) providing certain notices or reports and performing various analytical and characterization studies and (b) future capital improvements; and (ii) remediation activities, including certain on-site and off-site investigations and studies. Obligations related to ongoing future site operations under the Consent Order will involve additional operating costs and capital expenditures over multiple years. As offsite investigation activities continue, additional remediation amounts may become probable and reasonably estimable in the future.",

Obligations related to ongoing future site operations under the Consent Order or any further investigations may involve additional operating costs and capital expenditures over multiple years.\n\n## Cottage Grove, Minnesota\n\nThe Company is authorized to discharge wastewater from its Cottage Grove plant pursuant to an NPDES permit issued by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA). As previously reported, the Company discovered it had not fully characterized its PFAS discharge in its NPDES permit for the Cottage Grove facility and, in March 2020, disclosed this matter to the EPA and MPCA. The Company submitted an application to add the additional PFAS to its NPDES permit. The Company is currently installing a new wastewater treatment system to address PFAS.\n\nThe Company continues to work with the MPCA pursuant to the terms of an ongoing and previously disclosed May 2007 Settlement Agreement and Consent Order (\"SACO\") to address the presence of certain PFAS compounds in the soil and groundwater at former disposal sites in Washington County, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury) and at the Company's manufacturing facility at Cottage Grove, Minnesota. Under this agreement, the Company's principal obligations include (i) evaluating releases of certain PFAS compounds from these sites and proposing response actions, including actions to provide treatment or alternative drinking water upon identifying any level exceeding a Health Based Value (\"HBV\") or Health Risk Limit (\"HRL\") (i.e., the amount of a chemical in drinking water determined by the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) to be safe for human consumption over a lifetime) for certain PFAS compounds for which a HBV and/or HRL exists; (ii) remediating identified sources of other PFAS compounds at these sites that are not controlled by actions to remediate PFOA and PFOS; and (iii) sharing information with the MPCA about certain perfluorinated compounds. The Company also continues to implement the previously disclosed 2008 remedial decision adopted by MPCA for the Woodbury and Oakdale sites and the 2009 remedial decision adopted by MPCA for the Cottage Grove site.\n\nIn January 2024, the MDH issued updated, more stringent, HBVs for PFOA and PFOS. In October 2024, MDH proposed HRLs for PFOA and PFOS. 3M continues to evaluate any potential impact of these developments on its obligations under the SACO.\n\nIn August 2009, the MPCA issued a decision adopting remedial options for the Company's Cottage Grove manufacturing facility. In the spring and summer of 2010, 3M began implementing the approved remedial options at the Cottage Grove and Woodbury sites, and in late 2010, 3M commenced the approved remedial option at the Oakdale site. The Company continues to implement those remediation activities.\n\nIn January 2021, MPCA issue a Notice of Violation that included measures requiring the Company to address the presence of PFAS in wastewater and to undertake certain facility improvements related to its wastewater discharge system. The Company continues to work with MPCA to implement the measures in the Notice of Violation.\n\nIn June 2022, MPCA directed that the Company address the presence of PFAS in its stormwater discharge from the Cottage Grove facility. The Company worked with MPCA to develop a plan to address its stormwater, which is embodied in an order issued by MPCA in December 2022, which the Company is working to implement.\n\nIn July 2024, MPCA published for public comment a draft Clean Water Act permit for the Cottage Grove facility that contains significantly revised effluent limits for certain PFAS in compounds in water discharged from the facility, some of which are below current limits of quantification for those compounds. 3M engaged with the MPCA on the draft permit through the public comment period and submitted comments to the permit in August 2024. In response to comments submitted by 3M and other interested parties, in December 2024, MPCA issued a revised draft Clean Water Act permit for the Cottage Grove facility. 3M is engaging with the MPCA on the revised draft permit. The outcome of the Clean Water Act permit issuance process for the Cottage Grove facility could have a significant adverse impact on the facility's operations and the Company's businesses that receive products and other materials from the Cottage Grove facility, some of which may not be available or in similar quantities from other 3M facilities.\n\n## Hutchinson, Minnesota\n\nMPCA issued to the Company a Notice of Violation in March 2023, alleging that the Company is discharging stormwater containing PFAS at the 3M's facility in Hutchinson, Minnesota. The Company is working with MPCA regarding the allegations in the Notice of Violation.\n\nThe Company continues to work with relevant federal and state agencies (including EPA, the U.S. Department of Justice, state environmental agencies and state attorneys general) as it responds to information, inspection, and other requests from the agencies. The Company is in negotiations with EPA, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the Alabama, Illinois and Minnesota state environmental agencies to address claims arising under the CWA and the TSCA related to the Company's plants in those states. The Company cannot predict at this time the outcomes of resolving these compliance matters, what actions may be taken by the regulatory agencies or the potential consequences to the Company.",

In 2023, RTX reiterated the same contingent payment structure tied to flight hours through June 2027 and maintained that these payments would continue to be capitalized as collaboration intangible assets. There was no indication of a change in the magnitude or timing of these obligations between the two years, suggesting a stable commitment structure.",

The  extent  to  which  the  financing commitments will  be  utilized  is  not  currently  known,  since  customers  may  be  able  to  obtain  more  favorable  terms  from  other financing  sources.  We  may  also  arrange  for  third-party  investors  to  assume  a  portion  of  these  commitments.  The  majority  of financing  commitments  are  collateralized  arrangements.  We  may  also  lease  aircraft  and  subsequently  sublease  the  aircraft  to customers under long-term non-cancelable operating leases, or pay deposits on behalf of our customers to secure production slots with  the  airframers  (pre-delivery  payments).  Our  financing  commitments  with  customers  are  contingent  upon  maintenance  of certain levels of financial condition by the customers.\n\nAssociated risks on these commitments are mitigated due to the fact that interest rates are variable during the commitment term and are  set  at  the  date  of  funding  based  on  current  market  conditions,  the  fair  value  of  the  underlying  collateral  and  the  credit worthiness of the customers. As a result, the fair value of these financing commitments is expected to equal the amounts funded.\n\nWe also have other contractual  commitments,  including  commitments  to  make  payments  to  secure  certain  contractual  rights  to provide  product  on  new  aircraft  platforms. The  estimated  amount  and  timing  of  these  payments,  which  are  generally  based  on future sales or engine flight hours, are reflected in 'Other commercial aerospace commitments' in the table below. Payments made on these contractual commitments are included within intangible assets as exclusivity assets and are amortized over the term of underlying economic benefit. We have entered into certain collaboration arrangements, which may include participation by our collaboration  partners  in  these  commitments.  In  addition,  in  connection  with  our  2012  agreement  to  acquire  Rolls-Royce's ownership and collaboration interests in IAE, additional payments are due to Rolls-Royce contingent upon each hour flown through June 2027 by the V2500-powered aircraft in service as of the acquisition date. These flight hour payments, which are considered in 'Other commercial aerospace commitments' below, will be capitalized as collaboration intangible assets as payments are made.\n\nThe following is the expected maturity of our commercial aerospace industry commitments as of December 31, 2021:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2023, Gulfstream emphasized its leadership in the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and energy efficient engines, focusing on continuous R&D investment to develop technologically advanced business jets. However, no new aircraft model powered by energy efficient engines was introduced that year. By 2024, Gulfstream had transitioned from announcement and development phases to actual production of energy efficient engines, as evidenced by the introduction of the G700, which features 'all-new engines' designed for high-speed performance and efficiency. This marks a tangible evolution from strategic positioning in 2023 to operational realization in 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, Gulfstream highlighted its leadership in SAF and energy efficient engines as part of its broader R&D strategy but did not introduce a new aircraft model centered on this technology.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, Gulfstream announced the G700 entered service with 'all-new engines' that contribute to its 'superior high-speed performance' and efficiency, indicating a shift from strategic positioning to actual production.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a transformation in Gulfstream\u2019s approach, moving from promoting energy efficiency as a strategic goal to delivering it through new aircraft technology."

      "answer": "In 2023, General Dynamics' Marine Systems segment experienced a 110 basis point decline in operating margin due to supply chain disruptions affecting the Virginia-class submarine schedule and cost overruns on the DDG-51 guided-missile destroyer program. Despite these challenges, revenue from U.S. Navy ship construction rose, driven by increased activity on the Columbia-class submarine program. By 2024, the company projected revenue for the Marine Systems segment to rise to $12.8\u201312.9 billion with an expected operating margin of approximately 7.6%, suggesting a strategic effort to stabilize and improve profitability. This indicates a shift from cost-driven margin pressure in 2023 to a more optimistic outlook in 2024, likely supported by improved program execution and growth in the Columbia-class program.",

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nGeneral  Dynamics is  a  global  aerospace  and  defense  com pany  that  offers  a  broad  portfolio  of  products  and  services  in  business  aviation;  ship construction and repair; land com bat vehicles, weapons system s and m unitions; and technology products and services.\n\nThe  following  is  a  discussion  of  certain  significant  accounting  policies,  and  further  discussion  is  contained  in  other  notes  to  these  financial statements.\n\nBasis of Consolidation and Classification. The Consolidated Financial Statem ents include the accounts of General Dynam ics Corporation and our  wholly  owned  and  m ajority-owned  subsidiaries.  W e  elim inate  all  intercom pany  balances  and  transactions  in  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements.\n\nConsistent with industry practice, we classify assets and liabilities related to long-term  contracts as current, even though som e of these am ounts may not be realized within one year.\n\nUse of Estimates. The nature of our business requires that we m ake estim ates and assum ptions in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These estim ates and assum ptions affect the reported am ounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statem ents, as well as the reported am ounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. W e base our estim ates on historical experience, currently available inform ation and various other assum ptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results m ay differ from  these estim ates.\n\nResearch and Development Expenses. Company-sponsored research and development (R&amp;D) expenses, including Aerospace productdevelopment costs, were $565 in 2024, $510 in 2023 and $480 in 2022.  R&amp;D expenses are included in operating costs and expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings in the period in which they are incurred. Custom er-sponsored R&amp;D expenses are charged directly to the related contracts.\n\nThe Aerospace segment has cost-sharing arrangem ents with som e of its suppliers that enhance the segm ent's internal developm ent capabilities and offset a portion of the financial cost associated with the segm ent's product developm ent efforts. These arrangem ents explicitly state that supplier contributions are for reim bursem ent of costs we incur in the developm ent of new aircraft m odels and technologies, and we retain substantial rights in the  products  developed  under  these  arrangem ents.  W e  record  am ounts  received  from   these  cost-sharing  arrangem ents  as  a  reduction  of  R&amp;D expenses. We have no obligation to refund any am ounts received under the agreem ents regardless of the outcom e of the developm ent efforts. Under the typical term s of an agreem ent, paym ents received from  suppliers for their share of the costs are based on m ilestones and are recognized as received. Our policy is to defer paym ents in excess of the costs we have incurred.\n\nInterest, Net. Net interest expense consisted of the following:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2023, UNP explicitly stated that the expected return on plan assets was based on the asset allocation mix, historical returns, and market conditions, and included a specific actual return of 6% for that year. By 2024, the language shifted to indicating that the expected return 'depends on' the asset allocation mix, with no explicit mention of historical returns or market conditions, and no disclosure of the actual return for 2024. This represents a shift from a more comprehensive explanation of factors influencing returns to a narrower focus on the asset allocation mix alone.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, UNP disclosed that the expected return on pension plan assets was based on asset allocation, historical returns, and market conditions, and reported the actual return as 6%.",

        "Step 3: The change indicates a transformation in how UNP communicates the factors influencing expected pension returns, reducing transparency by excluding actual performance data and certain decision drivers."

      "answer": "In 2022, Caterpillar primarily sold reciprocating engines through its global dealer network and through subsidiary Perkins Engines Company Limited, which operated 90 distributors across 171 countries. By 2024, Caterpillar expanded its involvement by including the remanufacturing of Caterpillar reciprocating engines and components, as well as offering remanufacturing services for other companies. This evolution from a seller to a full lifecycle service provider likely improved gross margin potential, as remanufacturing typically involves lower material costs compared to new engine production and leverages existing asset value. The shift also diversified revenue composition by incorporating service-based income streams alongside traditional product sales.",

In all markets, we compete on the basis of product performance, customer service, quality and price.  From time to time, the intensity of competition results in price discounting in a particular industry or region.  Such price discounting puts pressure on margins and can negatively impact operating profit. Outside the United States, certain competitors enjoy competitive advantages inherent to operating in their home countries or regions.\n\n## Raw Materials and Component Products\n\nWe source our raw materials and manufactured components from suppliers both domestically and internationally. These purchases include unformed materials and rough and finished parts.  Unformed materials include a variety of steel products, which are then cut or formed to shape and machined in our facilities. Rough parts include various sized steel and iron castings and forgings, which are machined to final specification levels inside our facilities. Finished parts are ready to assemble components, which are made either to Caterpillar specifications or to supplier developed specifications.  We machine and assemble some of the components used in our machines, engines and power generation units and to support our after-market dealer parts sales. We also purchase various goods and services used in production, logistics, offices and product development processes.  We maintain global strategic sourcing models to meet our global facilities' production needs while building long-term supplier relationships and leveraging enterprise spend.  We expect our suppliers to maintain, at all times, industry-leading levels of quality and the ability to timely deliver raw materials and component products for our machine and engine products. However, in some cases, increases in demand or supply chain disruptions have led to parts and components constraints across some products. We use a variety of agreements with suppliers to protect our intellectual property and processes to monitor and mitigate risks of the supply base causing a business disruption. The risks monitored include supplier financial viability, the ability to increase or decrease production levels, business continuity, quality and delivery.\n\n## Patents and Trademarks\n\nWe own a number of patents and trademarks, which have been obtained over a period of years and relate to the products we manufacture and the services we provide. These patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our business. We do not regard our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents.\n\n## Order Backlog\n\nThe dollar amount of backlog believed to be firm was approximately $23.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and $14.2 billion at December 31, 2020. Compared with year-end 2020, the order backlog increased across the three primary segments, with the largest increase in Energy &amp; Transportation. Of the total backlog at December 31, 2021, approximately $4.3 billion was not expected to be filled in 2022.\n\n## Dealers and Distributors\n\nWe distribute our machines principally through a worldwide organization of dealers (dealer network), 44 located in the United States and 116 located outside the United States, serving 193 countries.  We sell reciprocating engines principally through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in products. We also sell some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by our subsidiary Perkins Engines Company Limited through its worldwide network of 90 distributors covering 171 countries. We sell the FG Wilson branded electric power generation systems through its worldwide network of 110 distributors covering 109 countries.  We also sell some of the large, medium speed reciprocating engines under the MaK brand through a worldwide network of 20 distributors covering 130 countries.\n\nOur dealers do not deal exclusively with our products; however, in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers' principal business.  We sell some products, primarily turbines and locomotives, directly to end customers through sales forces employed by the company.  At times, these employees are assisted by independent sales representatives.",

Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees.\n\nTotal sales and revenues for 2021 were $50.971 billion, an increase of $9.223 billion, or 22 percent, compared with $41.748 billion in 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume, driven by higher end-user demand for equipment and services and the impact from changes in dealer inventories, along with favorable price realization. Dealers decreased their inventories about $2.9 billion in 2020, compared to a decrease of about $100 million in 2021.\n\nSales were higher across all regions and in the three primary segments.\n\nNorth America sales increased 23 percent driven by higher end-user demand for equipment and services, the impact from changes in dealer inventories and favorable price realization. Dealers decreased inventories more during 2020 than during 2021.\n\nSales  increased  51  percent  in Latin America due  to  higher  end-user  demand  for  equipment  and  services  and  the  impact  from changes in dealer inventories. Dealers decreased inventories during 2020, compared to an increase during 2021.\n\nEAME sales  increased  24  percent  due  to  higher  end-user  demand  for  equipment  and  services,  the  impact  of  changes  in  dealer inventories,  favorable  currency  impacts  primarily  related  to  a  stronger  euro  and  British  pound  and  favorable  price  realization. Dealers decreased inventories during 2020, compared to an increase during 2021.\n\nAsia/Pacific sales increased 15 percent driven by higher end-user demand for equipment and services, the impact of changes in dealer inventories and favorable currency impacts related to a stronger Australian dollar and Chinese yuan. Dealers decreased their inventories during 2020, compared to remaining about flat during 2021.\n\nDealers decreased their inventories about $2.9 billion in 2020, compared to a decrease of about $100 million in 2021. Dealers are independent, and the reasons for changes in their inventory levels vary, including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers' demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions, machine rental rates and  other  factors.  Delivery  times  can  vary  based  on  availability  of  product  from  Caterpillar  factories  and  product  distribution centers. We expect dealer inventories to be about flat in 2022 compared to 2021.",

The decrease reflected lower sales volume , partially offset by favorable price realization . Lower sales volume was primarily driven by lower sales of equipment to end users. Profit per share was $22.05 in 2024, compared with profit per share of $20.12 in 2023. Profit was $10.792 billion in 2024, compared with $10.335 billion in 2023. The profit impact of lower sales volume was more than offset by favorable price realization and the absence of the impact of the divestiture of the company's Longwall business in 2023.\n\n## Trends and Economic Conditions\n\n## Outlook for Key End Markets\n\nOur results continue to reflect the benefit of the diversity of our end markets.\n\nIn Construction Industries, we expect moderately lower sales of equipment to end users in North America in 2025 compared to 2024. Construction spend in North America  remains  healthy,  primarily  driven  by  large,  multi-year  projects  and  government-related  infrastructure  investments  supported  by  funding  from  the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). Although we anticipate the combined non-residential and residential construction spend in 2025 to remain similar to 2024 levels, our current planning assumptions reflect lower demand for new equipment in 2025 as compared to 2024. We also expect lower dealer rental fleet loading in 2025 compared to 2024, although dealer rental revenue is expected to grow. We remain positive about the medium- and long-term outlook in North America. In Asia Pacific, outside of China, we ex pect soft economic conditions to",

      "answer": "In 2022, Caterpillar indicated that it uses 'a variety of agreements with suppliers to protect our intellectual property and processes to monitor and mitigate risks of the supply base causing a business disruption,' including monitoring supplier financial viability. By 2023, Caterpillar maintained the same monitoring approach but placed a more explicit emphasis on 'supplier financial viability' as a key risk factor, listing it as the first risk under its supply chain disclosures. Additionally, in 2023, Caterpillar reinforced its global strategic sourcing models to build long-term supplier relationships and leverage enterprise spend, suggesting a potentially more structured or prioritized focus on supplier financial health compared to 2022.",

In all markets, we compete on the basis of product performance, customer service, quality and price.  From time to time, the intensity of competition results in price discounting in a particular industry or region.  Such price discounting puts pressure on margins and can negatively impact operating profit. Outside the United States, certain competitors enjoy competitive advantages inherent to operating in their home countries or regions.\n\n## Raw Materials and Component Products\n\nWe source our raw materials and manufactured components from suppliers both domestically and internationally. These purchases include unformed materials and rough and finished parts.  Unformed materials include a variety of steel products, which are then cut or formed to shape and machined in our facilities. Rough parts include various sized steel and iron castings and forgings, which are machined to final specification levels inside our facilities. Finished parts are ready to assemble components, which are made either to Caterpillar specifications or to supplier developed specifications.  We machine and assemble some of the components used in our machines, engines and power generation units and to support our after-market dealer parts sales. We also purchase various goods and services used in production, logistics, offices and product development processes.  We maintain global strategic sourcing models to meet our global facilities' production needs while building long-term supplier relationships and leveraging enterprise spend.  We expect our suppliers to maintain, at all times, industry-leading levels of quality and the ability to timely deliver raw materials and component products for our machine and engine products. However, in some cases, increases in demand or supply chain disruptions have led to parts and components constraints across some products. We use a variety of agreements with suppliers to protect our intellectual property and processes to monitor and mitigate risks of the supply base causing a business disruption. The risks monitored include supplier financial viability, the ability to increase or decrease production levels, business continuity, quality and delivery.\n\n## Patents and Trademarks\n\nWe own a number of patents and trademarks, which have been obtained over a period of years and relate to the products we manufacture and the services we provide. These patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our business. We do not regard our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents.\n\n## Order Backlog\n\nThe dollar amount of backlog believed to be firm was approximately $23.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and $14.2 billion at December 31, 2020. Compared with year-end 2020, the order backlog increased across the three primary segments, with the largest increase in Energy &amp; Transportation. Of the total backlog at December 31, 2021, approximately $4.3 billion was not expected to be filled in 2022.\n\n## Dealers and Distributors\n\nWe distribute our machines principally through a worldwide organization of dealers (dealer network), 44 located in the United States and 116 located outside the United States, serving 193 countries.  We sell reciprocating engines principally through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in products. We also sell some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by our subsidiary Perkins Engines Company Limited through its worldwide network of 90 distributors covering 171 countries. We sell the FG Wilson branded electric power generation systems through its worldwide network of 110 distributors covering 109 countries.  We also sell some of the large, medium speed reciprocating engines under the MaK brand through a worldwide network of 20 distributors covering 130 countries.\n\nOur dealers do not deal exclusively with our products; however, in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers' principal business.  We sell some products, primarily turbines and locomotives, directly to end customers through sales forces employed by the company.  At times, these employees are assisted by independent sales representatives.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Caterpillar described its relationship with independent dealers in general terms as part of its global sales and marketing strategy. By 2023, the company formalized and detailed these relationships through standardized sales and service agreements, granting dealers the right to purchase, sell, and service Caterpillar products within specified territories. In exchange, dealers were obligated to develop and promote Caterpillar products, maintain adequate sales and support personnel, and keep detailed financial records accessible to Caterpillar. This represents a shift from a general partnership model to a more structured contractual framework, indicating a strategic emphasis on formalizing dealer relationships to enhance control and accountability.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## PART I\n\n## Item 1. Business.\n\n## General\n\nOriginally organized as Caterpillar Tractor Co. in 1925 in the State of California, our company was reorganized as Caterpillar Inc. in 1986 in the State of Delaware.  As used herein, the term 'Caterpillar,' 'we,' 'us,' 'our' or 'the company' refers to Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries unless designated or identified otherwise.\n\n## Overview\n\nWith 2021 sales and revenues of $50.971 billion, Caterpillar is the world's leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, off-highway diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines and diesel-electric locomotives.  The company principally operates through its three primary segments - Construction Industries, Resource Industries and Energy &amp; Transportation - and also provides financing and related services through its Financial Products segment. Caterpillar is also a leading U.S. exporter.  Through a global network of independent dealers and direct sales of certain products, Caterpillar builds long-term relationships with customers around the world.\n\nCurrently, we have five operating segments, of which four are reportable segments and are described below.\n\n## Categories of Business Organization\n\n1. Machinery, Energy &amp; Transportation - Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries, excluding Financial Products. Machinery, Energy &amp; Transportation information relates to the design, manufacturing and marketing of our products.\n2. Financial Products - Our finance and insurance subsidiaries, primarily Caterpillar Financial Services Corporation (Cat Financial) and Caterpillar Insurance Holdings Inc. (Insurance Services). Financial Products information relates to the financing to customers and dealers for the purchase and lease of Caterpillar and other equipment.\n\nOther information about our operations in 2021, including certain risks associated with our operations, is included in Part II, Item 7 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.'\n\n## Construction Industries\n\nOur Construction Industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in infrastructure, forestry and building construction.  The majority of machine sales in this segment are made in the heavy and general construction, rental, quarry and aggregates markets and mining.\n\nThe nature of customer demand for construction machinery varies around the world.  Customers in developing economies often prioritize purchase price in making their investment decisions, while customers in developed economies generally weigh productivity and other performance criteria that contribute to lower owning and operating costs over the lifetime of the machine. To meet customer expectations in developing economies, Caterpillar developed differentiated product offerings that target customers in those markets, including our SEM brand machines.  We believe that these customer-driven product innovations enable us to compete more effectively in developing economies. The majority of Construction Industries' research and development spending in 2021 focused on the next generation of construction machines.\n\nThe competitive environment for construction machinery is characterized by some global competitors and many regional and specialized local competitors. Examples of global competitors include CASE (part of CNH Industrial N.V.), Deere Construction &amp; Forestry (part of Deere &amp; Company), Doosan Infracore Co., Ltd., Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., Ltd., Hyundai Construction Equipment Co., Ltd., Hyundai Doosan Infracore Co., Ltd. and Hyundai Construction Equipment Co., Ltd. (both part of Hyundai Heavy Industries Holdings Co.), J.C. Bamford Excavators Ltd., Kobelco Construction Machinery (part of Kobe Steel, Ltd), Komatsu Ltd., Kubota Farm &amp; Industrial Machinery (part of Kubota Corporation), and Volvo Construction Equipment (part of the Volvo Group). As an example of regional and local competitors, our competitors in China also include Guangxi LiuGong Machinery Co., Ltd., Longking Holdings Ltd., Sany Heavy Industry Co., Ltd., XCMG Construction Machinery Co., Ltd., Shandong Lingong Construction Machinery Co., Ltd. (SDLG, part of the Volvo Group) and Shantui Construction Machinery Co., Ltd., (part of Shandong Heavy Industry Group Co.). Each of these companies has varying product lines that compete with Caterpillar products, and each has varying degrees of regional focus.",

      "answer": "In 2023, 3M reconsolidated the Aearo Entities following the dismissal of their bankruptcy filings, lifting the stay on litigation related to Combat Arms Earplugs and entering into the CAE Settlement to resolve existing and future claims. This reconsolidation had an immaterial income statement impact. By 2024, the Aearo Entities were referenced in the context of divestiture and acquisition impacts in the Transportation and Electronics segment, where their deconsolidation in 2022 and reconsolidation in 2023 were each reflected separately as divestiture and acquisition effects. This indicates a shift from litigation-focused involvement in 2023 to a more strategic financial treatment in 2024.",

For Transportation and Electronics these adjustments include the sales and estimates of income regarding PFAS manufactured products that 3M plans to exit by the end of 2025. Refer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section for additional details.\n\n## Year 2024 results:\n\nSales in Transportation and Electronics were down 1.4 percent in U.S. dollars. Adjusting for special item PFAS manufactured products (non-GAAP measure), sales were up 3.1 percent in U.S. dollars.\n\n## On an organic sales basis:\n\n- Sales increased in electronics, were flat in commercial branding and transportation, and decreased in advanced materials, and in automotive and aerospace.\n- Growth was negatively impacted by headwinds related to PFAS manufactured products and automotive OEM build rates, partially offset by new product launches and spec-wins that drove share gain.\n\n## Acquisitions/divestitures:\n\n- Divestiture and acquisition impacts relate to lost/gained Transportation and Electronics sales year-on-year from the Aearo Entities. In the third quarter of 2022, 3M deconsolidated the Aearo Entities and, in the second quarter of 2023, reconsolidated those entities. For each of the 12-months postdeconsolidation and post-reconsolidation, impacts are each reflected separately as divestiture and acquisition, respectively.\n\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year driven by benefits from non-PFAS manufacturing growth and productivity, spending discipline, and restructuring partially offset by dis-synergies due to the spin of Solventum. Margins were also impacted by decreasing PFAS manufacturing. Adjusting for special item PFAS manufactured products (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins increased year-on-year as displayed above.\n\n## Year 2023 results:\n\nSales in Transportation and Electronics were down 4.5 percent in U.S. dollars. Adjusting for special item PFAS manufactured products (non-GAAP measure), sales were down 4.5 percent in U.S. dollars.\n\n## On an organic sales basis:\n\n- Sales increased in automotive and aerospace, were flat in commercial branding and transportation and decreased in electronics and advanced materials.\n- Growth continued to be held back by consumer electronics end-market weakness.",

      "answer": "In 2023, MMM had an accrual of $574 million for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities excluding Aearo, and Aearo was in bankruptcy proceedings, which resulted in a stay of litigation. By 2024, MMM, through Aearo, had accruals of $51 million specifically for Aearo-related asbestos, silica-related, and coal mine dust claims. Additionally, Aearo\u2019s liability was limited by its agreement with Cabot, where Cabot assumed responsibility for claims involving exposure prior to January 1, 1997, as long as Aearo continued to pay a quarterly fee of $100,000. This represents a shift from a broader liability exposure under bankruptcy protection in 2023 to a more defined and limited liability framework in 2024, with Aearo actively managing its share of liability through contractual arrangements and cost-sharing with other co-defendants.",

        "Step 3: The change reflects a transformation in the nature of liability from a broad, uncertain accrual in 2023 to a more defined and limited liability in 2024, with contractual mechanisms in place to cap exposure."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nRespirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation - Aearo Technologies: On April 1, 2008, a subsidiary of the Company acquired the stock of Aearo Holding Corp., the parent of Aearo Technologies ('Aearo'). Aearo manufactured and sold various products, including personal protection equipment, such as eye, ear, head, face, fall and certain respiratory protection products. Aearo and/or other companies that previously owned and operated Aearo's respirator business (American Optical Corporation, Warner-Lambert LLC, AO Corp. and Cabot Corporation ('Cabot')) are named defendants, with multiple co-defendants, including the Company, in numerous lawsuits in various courts in which plaintiffs allege use of mask and respirator products and seek damages from Aearo and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica-related, coal mine dust, or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company, through its Aearo subsidiary, had accruals of $51 million for product liabilities and defense costs related to current and future Aearo-related asbestos, silica-related and coal mine dust claims. Responsibility for legal costs, as well as for settlements and judgments, is shared in an informal arrangement among Aearo, Cabot, American Optical Corporation and a subsidiary of Warner Lambert and their respective insurers (the 'Payor Group'). Liability is allocated among the parties based on the number of years each company sold respiratory products under the 'AO Safety' brand and/or owned the AO Safety Division of American Optical Corporation and the alleged years of exposure of the individual plaintiff. Aearo's share of the contingent liability is further limited by an agreement entered into between Aearo and Cabot on July 11, 1995. This agreement provides that, so long as Aearo pays to Cabot a quarterly fee of $100,000, Cabot will retain responsibility and liability for, and indemnify Aearo against, any product liability claims involving ex posure to asbestos, silica, or silica products for respirators sold prior to July 11, 1995. Because of the difficulty in determining how long a particular respirator remains in the stream of commerce after being sold, Aearo and Cabot have applied the agreement to claims arising out of the alleged use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos, silica or silica products prior to January 1, 1997. With these arrangements in place, Aearo's potential liability is limited to ex posures alleged to have arisen from the use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos, silica, or silica products on or after January 1, 1997. To date, Aearo has elected to pay the quarterly fee. Aearo could potentially be ex posed to additional claims for some part of the pre-July 11, 1995, period covered by its agreement with Cabot if Aearo elects to discontinue its participation in this arrangement, or if Cabot is no longer able to meet its obligations in these matters.\n\nDevelopments may occur that could affect the estimate of Aearo's liabilities. These developments include, but are not limited to: (i) significant changes in the number of future claims, (ii) significant changes in the average cost of resolving claims, (iii) significant changes in the legal costs of defending these claims, (iv) significant changes in the mix and nature of claims received, (v) trial and appellate outcomes, (vi) significant changes in the law and procedure applicable to these claims, (vii) significant changes in the liability allocation among the co-defendants, (viii) the financial viability of members of the Payor G roup including ex haustion of available insurance coverage limits, and/or (ix ) a determination that the interpretation of the contractual obligations on which Aearo has estimated its share of liability is inaccurate. The Company cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on its current estimate of Aearo's share of liability for these existing and future claims. If any of the developments described above were to occur, the actual amount of these liabilities for ex isting and future claims could be significantly larger than the amount accrued. Because of the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted, the complexity of allocating responsibility for future claims among the Payor Group, and the several possible developments that may occur that could affect the estimate of Aearo's liabilities, the Company cannot estimate the amount or range of amounts by which Aearo's liability may exceed the accrual the Company has established.\n\nEnvironmental Matters and Litigation: The Company's operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations including those pertaining to air emissions, wastewater discharges, toxic or hazardous substances, and the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, which are enforceable by national, state, and local authorities around the world, and many for which private parties in the United States and abroad may have rights of action. These laws and regulations can form the basis of, under certain circumstances, claims for the investigation and remediation of contamination, for capital investment in pollution control equipment, for restoration of and/or compensation for damages to natural resources, and for personal injury and property damages. The Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and capital ex penditures in complying with these laws and regulations, defending personal injury, natural resource, and property damage claims, and modifying its business operations in light of its environmental responsibilities. In its effort to satisfy its environmental responsibilities and comply with environmental laws and regulations, the Company has established, and periodically updates, policies relating to environmental standards of performance for its operations worldwide.\n\nUnder certain environmental laws, including the United States Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (\"CERCLA\") and similar state laws, the Company may be jointly and severally liable, sometimes with other potentially responsible parties, for the costs of investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at current or former facilities and at off-site locations where hazardous substances have been released or disposed of. The Company has identified numerous locations, many of which are in the United States, at which it may have some liability for remediation of contamination under applicable environmental laws. Please refer to the section entitled ' Environmental Liabilities and Insurance Recovery ' that follows for information on the amount of the accrual for such liabilities.",

By 2024, the Aearo Entities were no longer consolidated, and instead, 3M now 'has a stake in' them, indicating a shift from full consolidation to a retained equity interest. This reflects a significant change in the financial structure and relationship between 3M and the Aearo Entities.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## 3M Company and Subsidiaries\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## NOTE 1. Significant Accounting Policies\n\nNature of Operations and Basis of Presentation: 3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products. As used herein, the term '3M' or 'Company' refers to 3M Company and subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes. Such estimates and assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may result in actual amounts differing from these estimates.\n\nThe financial statements consolidate all applicable subsidiaries; intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated. In the second quarter of 2023, 3M reconsolidated the Aearo Technology and certain of its related entities (collectively, the \"Aearo Entities\") as a result of the court dismissal of their voluntary bankruptcy proceedings. 3M had previously deconsolidated these entities in the third quarter of 2022.\n\nLocal currencies generally are considered the functional currencies outside the United States, with the exception of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, which are not material to 3M. Assets and liabilities for operations in local-currency environments are translated at month-end exchange rates of the period reported. Income and expense items are translated at average monthly currency exchange rates in effect during the period. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders' equity.\n\nCertain amounts in prior periods' consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. Information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all applicable periods presented.\n\n- As discussed in Note 2, on April 1, 2024, 3M completed the previously announced separation of its Health Care business (the Separation) through a pro rata distribution of 80.1% of the outstanding shares of Solventum Corporation (Solventum) to 3M stockholders. As a result of the Separation, Solventum became an independent public company and 3M no longer consolidates Solventum into 3M's financial results. In connection with the Separation, the historical net income of Solventum and applicable assets and liabilities included in the Separation are reported in 3M's consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations.\n- 3M made certain changes to the composition of segment information reviewed by 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM) effective in the second quarter of 2024 largely as a result of the separation of Solventum and changes within its business segments effective in the first quarter of 2024 as further described in Note 22. To the extent these changes impacted 3M's disclosed disaggregated revenue information, data in Note 3 has also been updated.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary investments with maturities of three months or less when acquired.\n\nInvestments: 3M invests in marketable and equity securities. Marketable securities include available-for-sale debt securities and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The classification of marketable securities as current or noncurrent is based on the availability for use in current operations. 3M accounts for its ownership interest in Solventum as an equity investment with a readily determinable fair value. All equity securities that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method are measured at fair value with changes therein reflected in net income. 3M utilizes the measurement alternative for equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values and measures these investments at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes in orderly transactions. The balances associated with equity securities are disclosed in Note 8.\n\n3M regularly reviews investment securities for impairment. For debt securities, an impairment relating to credit losses is recorded through an allowance for credit losses. A change in the allowance for credit losses is recorded into earnings in the period of the change. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of shareholders' equity. Amounts are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and into earnings upon sale or a change in the portions of impairment related to credit losses and not related to credit losses.\n\nInventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (NRV), which is defined as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Cost is generally determined on a first-in, first-out basis.",

      "answer": "In 2023, RTX provided specific quantified impacts of Acquisition Accounting Adjustments on operating profit, showing a negative impact of $1,998 million in 2023, compared to $1,893 million in 2022 and $2,203 million in 2021. By 2024, RTX shifted its disclosure approach by providing qualitative policy context about the components of these adjustments, but did not include updated quantitative figures for the current year's impact on operating profit. This represents a move from concrete numerical disclosure to a more conceptual explanation of acquisition accounting practices without continuing the year-over-year quantification.",

        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 (2023) - RTX disclosed specific dollar amounts showing the negative impact of Acquisition Accounting Adjustments on operating profit ($1,998 million in 2023).",

        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The disclosure evolved from quantitative reporting of specific impacts to qualitative policy explanation, discontinuing the year-over-year numerical comparisons previously provided."

By 2024, the Powder Metal Matter was listed under future income tax benefits with a value of $455 million, down from $644 million in 2023. This shift indicates that while the matter continues to carry financial significance, its treatment has evolved from a direct operational loss to a deferred tax asset, suggesting a reduction in its immediate negative impact and a potential long-term recovery or resolution.",

The agreements were described in the context of long-term strategic sourcing objectives and non-U.S. business requirements.

Operating investments align strategically and are integrated with our operations.  Earnings  from  operating  investments,  including  our  share  of  income  or  loss  from  equity  method investments, dividend income from other equity investments, and any impairments or gain/loss on the disposition of these investments, are recorded in Income from operating investments, net. Non-operating investments are those we hold  for  non-strategic  purposes.  Earnings  from  non-operating  investments,  including  interest  and  dividends  on marketable securities, and any impairments or gain/loss on the disposition of these investments are recorded in Other income/(loss), net.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nAll  derivative  instruments  are  recognized  in  the  financial  statements  and  measured  at  fair  value  regardless  of  the purpose or intent of holding them. We use derivative instruments to principally manage a variety of market risks. For our cash flow hedges, the derivative's gain or loss is initially reported in comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period(s) during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. We have  agreements  to  purchase  and  sell  aluminum  to  address  long-term  strategic  sourcing  objectives  and  non-U.S. business requirements. These agreements are derivatives for accounting purposes but are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. We also hold certain derivative instruments for economic purposes that are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. For these aluminum agreements and for other derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings immediately.\n\n## Allowances for Losses on Certain Financial Assets\n\nWe establish allowances for credit losses on accounts receivable, unbilled receivables, customer financing receivables and certain other financial assets. The adequacy of these allowances is assessed quarterly through consideration of factors  such  as  customer  credit  ratings,  bankruptcy  filings,  published  or  estimated  credit  default  rates,  age  of  the receivable,  expected  loss  rates  and  collateral  exposures.  We  determine  the  creditworthiness  of  our  customers  by assigning internal credit ratings based upon publicly available information and information obtained directly from the customers. Our rating categories are comparable to those used by major credit rating agencies.\n\n## Aircraft Valuation\n\nUsed  aircraft  under  trade-in  commitments  and  aircraft  under  repurchase  commitments In  conjunction  with signing a definitive agreement for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at a specified price upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft.  Additionally,  we  have  entered  into  contingent  repurchase  commitments  with  certain  customers  wherein  we agree to repurchase the Sale Aircraft at a specified price, generally 10 to 15 years after delivery of the Sale Aircraft. Our repurchase of the Sale Aircraft is contingent upon a future, mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft. If we execute an agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft, and if the customer exercises its right to sell the Sale Aircraft to us, a contingent repurchase commitment would become a trade-in commitment. Our historical experience is that contingent repurchase commitments infrequently become trade-in commitments.",

      "question": "How has Boeing's strategy with commodity purchase contracts evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of risk management horizon and financial exposure?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Boeing disclosed that a 10% change in commodity prices would impact unrealized losses by $46 million, and the company used commodity swaps and purchase contracts to hedge against price volatility, neutralizing material market risk. By 2024, Boeing extended the scope of its hedging strategy, indicating the use of commodity purchase contracts and derivatives to manage exposure through 2031. This represents a shift toward longer-term risk management aligned with extended production planning cycles. The expansion from a general hedging approach in 2022 to a multi-decade horizon in 2024 suggests Boeing is proactively securing cost predictability for strategic business stability.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Boeing reported a $46 million unrealized loss sensitivity from a 10% commodity price movement, indicating active hedging but without specifying time horizons.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, Boeing disclosed the use of commodity purchase contracts extending through 2031, demonstrating a long-term strategic shift in managing commodity price risk.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects an evolution from a near-term hedging approach to a long-range risk mitigation strategy, likely to stabilize costs over extended production cycles and enhance financial predictability."

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nWe have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed- and floating-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. The investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt. In 2021, we repaid the $13.8 billion outstanding under our two-year floating-rate delayed  draw  term  loan  credit  agreement. As  a  result,  as  of  December  31,  2021,  we  do  not  have  any  significant floating-rate debt obligations. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on our customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes.\n\n## Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\n\nWe are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business. Foreign currency forward contracts  are  sensitive  to  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates. At  December  31,  2021,  a  10%  increase  or decrease in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have increased or decreased our unrealized losses by $241 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations,  such  unrealized  losses  or  gains  would  be  offset  by  corresponding  gains  or  losses,  respectively,  in  the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk.\n\n## Commodity Price Risk\n\nWe are subject to commodity price risk relating to commodity purchase contracts for items used in production that are subject to changes in the market price. We use commodity swaps and commodity purchase contracts to hedge against these potentially unfavorable price changes. Our commodity purchase contracts and derivatives are both sensitive to changes in the market price. At December 31, 2021, a 10% increase or decrease in the market price in our commodity derivatives would have increased or decreased our unrealized losses by $46 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts  to  neutralize  the  effect  of  market  price  fluctuations,  such  unrealized  losses  or  gains  would  be  offset  by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these commodity purchase contracts and the offsetting swaps do not create material market risk.",

      "answer": "In 2023, FedEx emphasized the strategic importance of Network 2.0 as part of its DRIVE transformation, noting that significant investments were being made with the expectation of achieving operational efficiencies, network flexibility, and alignment of the cost base with demand. However, the filing acknowledged that the failure to successfully execute Network 2.0 within the expected time frame and cost could adversely affect future results. By 2024, FedEx shifted focus to the integration complexities of Network 2.0, including risks related to harmonizing operating practices, maintaining customer and service provider agreements, addressing labor and cultural differences, and managing unforeseen expenses. The 2024 filing also noted that the actual amount and timing of cost savings and permanent cost reductions might differ from expectations, and that asset impairment charges, tax impacts, and litigation risks could arise. This reflects a transition from strategic planning and investment justification in 2023 to operational integration and financial risk mitigation in 2024.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, FedEx highlighted strategic investments in Network 2.0 with expectations of operational efficiencies and cost alignment, but warned of adverse effects if implementation timelines and costs were not met.",

        "Step 3: The evolution shows a shift from strategic intent and projected benefits in 2023 to a more cautious, risk-aware stance in 2024, with specific emphasis on financial outcomes such as cost savings, permanent cost reductions, and potential legal and tax impacts."

The actual amount and timing of costs to be incurred and related cost savings and reductions to our permanent cost structure resulting from these initiatives and enhancements may differ from our current expectations and estimates. These initiatives and enhancements could also result in asset impairment charges and changes to our tax liabilities and deferred tax balances and subject us to litigation. If we are not able to successfully implement our DRIVE transformation our future financial results will suffer and we may not be able to achieve our financial performance goals.\n\nAll of these factors could adversely affect FedEx's results of operations and negatively affect the price of our common stock. In addition, at times the attention of certain members of our management may be focused on the DRIVE transformation and diverted from day-to-day business operations, which may disrupt our business.\n\nA significant data breach or other disruption to our technology infrastructure could disrupt our operations and result in the loss of critical sensitive or confidential information, adversely affecting our reputation, business, or results of operations. Our ability to attract and retain customers, efficiently operate our businesses, execute our DRIVE transformation, and compete effectively increasingly depend in part upon the sophistication, security, and reliability of our technology network, including our ability to provide features of service that are important to our customers, to protect our confidential business information and the information provided by our customers, and to maintain customer confidence in our ability to protect our systems and to provide services consistent with their expectations. For example, we rely on information technology to receive shipment information in advance of physical receipt of packages, to track items that move through our delivery systems, to efficiently plan deliveries, to clear shipments through customs, to execute billing processes, and to track and report financial and operational data. We are subject to risks imposed by data breaches and operational disruptions, both random and targeted, including through cyberattack or cyberintrusion, ransomware attack, malware attack, or denial of service attack by computer hackers, foreign governments and state-sponsored actors, cyber terrorists and hacktivists, cyber criminals, malicious employees or other insiders of FedEx or third-party service providers, and other groups and individuals. Data breaches and other technology disruptions of companies and governments continue to increase as the number, intensity, and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased and we, our customers, and third parties increasingly store and transmit data by means of connected information technology systems. Additionally, risks such as code anomalies, 'Acts of God,' transitional challenges in migrating operating company functionality to our FedEx enterprise automation platforms, data leakage, cyber-fraud, and human error pose a direct threat to our products, services, systems, and data and could result in unauthorized or block legitimate access to sensitive or confidential data regarding our operations, customers, employees, and suppliers, including personal information.\n\nThe technology infrastructure of acquired businesses, as well as their practices related to the use and maintenance of data, could also present issues that we were not able to identify prior to the acquisition.

      "question": "How has the strategic positioning of FedEx Office's Ship and Go kiosk evolved between 2023 and 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's approach to e-commerce logistics and returns management?",
      "answer": "In 2023, the Ship and Go kiosk was described primarily as a self-serve shipping solution available in approximately 1,300 locations, allowing customers to generate labels via mobile or QR code and drop off packages securely. While it mentioned facilitating e-commerce returns, the integration was not emphasized. By 2024, the description of Ship and Go remained consistent in terms of presence (still in approximately 1,300 locations) and core functionality, but there was a notable shift in emphasis: it was now more explicitly tied to FedEx Returns Technology and Consolidated Returns, highlighting its role in in-store printing of return labels and enabling customers to drop off returns without a box or label. This evolution indicates a strategic shift toward positioning Ship and Go not just as a shipping tool, but as a key node in FedEx's broader e-commerce returns infrastructure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, Ship and Go was primarily framed as a self-serve shipping kiosk in approximately 1,300 locations, with limited emphasis on returns integration.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the Ship and Go kiosk retained the same core functionality and location count, but the narrative shifted to emphasize its role in facilitating returns through FedEx Returns Technology and Consolidated Returns.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a strategic repositioning of the kiosk from a shipping convenience tool to a critical component of FedEx's e-commerce returns ecosystem, suggesting a broader alignment with evolving customer needs in digital commerce."

By adopting this single platform - where machine learning models are reusable and self-learning - we are able to solve problems and deliver value to stakeholders at speed, scale, and with the right economics. This enterprise data platform serves as the foundation for our data science and machine learning practice and houses a common set of models and insights that can be reused across different use cases. Focusing on design principles that embrace simplification, our teams are working to enhance efficiencies and value across our operational portfolio. As we move forward as one FedEx, FedEx Dataworks is playing a critical role in creating data-driven solutions.\n\nFor more information regarding FedEx Dataworks' e-commerce partnerships, tools, and solutions, see 'Federal Express Segment - Customer-Driven Technology E-Commerce and Digital Solutions.'\n\nSriram Krishnasamy is the Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Dataworks, which is based in Memphis, Tennessee. As of June 7, 2024, FedEx Dataworks had approximately 600 employees. FedEx Dataworks is an operating segment that is included in 'Corporate, other, and eliminations' in our segment reporting.\n\n## FedEx Office Operating Segment\n\nAs of June 7, 2024, FedEx Office operated approximately 2,000 customer-facing stores and manages the relationship and strategy for all on-site, owned, and thirdparty retail channel locations, providing convenient access to printing and shipping expertise with reliable service.\n\nThe FedEx Office brick-and-mortar network features retail stores, FedEx Office locations inside Walmart stores, manufacturing plants, corporate on-site print centers, and on-site business centers at colleges and universities, hotels, convention centers, corporate campuses, and healthcare campuses. Many of these locations are open later in the evenings to accommodate urgent printing projects and delivery drop-offs. FedEx Office has designed a suite of printing and shipping management solutions that are flex ible and scalable, allowing customers to meet their unique printing and shipping needs. The network provides an adaptable cost model helping to save time, labor, and overhead by freeing up resources and avoiding fixed costs associated with large-scale printing and e-commerce parcel volumes. This is especially valuable to our enterprise customers looking to outsource their print supply chain. Services include digital printing, professional finishing, document creation, design services, direct mail, signs and graphics, custom-printed boxes, copying, computer rental, free Wi-Fi, corporate print solutions, ex pedited U.S. passport processing and renewal through a collaboration with a registered U.S. passport agency, and fully digital notarization services through FedEx Office Online Notary.\n\nWith the FedEx Office Print On Demand solution, customers can use their laptops or mobile devices to design their print needs or access their personal cloud accounts, and print directly to any FedEx Office location in the U.S., or have their order delivered right to their door. Customers also have the flex ibility of using FedEx Office's Print &amp; Go solutions to print at self-serve locations from USBs, the cloud, or through email. Print &amp; Go solutions allow customers to access files using popular cloud providers Google Drive\u2122, Box, Microsoft OneDrive\u00ae, and from FedEx Office's own My Online Documents, making printing easy.\n\nFedEx Office has prioritized e-commerce and digital offerings as a growth opportunity for the enterprise/large, medium, and small business customers we serve. FedEx Office has partnered with a content and creative design platform to form a digital design-to-print marketplace offering millions of images and illustrations, an ex tensive library of templates, and a simple drag-and-drop interface to create custom business materials from fedex.com on any device, with next-day printing on many requests available at FedEx Office stores. Additionally, FedEx Office has partnered with a leading marketing solutions company to introduce an online branded promotional products marketplace that allows businesses to customize and purchase high-quality promotional products. FedEx Office has also made investments in new machines and technology, enhancing capabilities in narrow format color, grand format, large format, color management, enhanced finishing, and other technologies.\n\nFedEx Office provides customers convenient access to the full range of Federal Express shipping services. Customers may have their Federal Express packages delivered to any FedEx Office customer-facing location nationwide through the Hold at FedEx Location service, free of charge, and may redirect packages to these locations through Redirect to Hold or AutoRedirect to Hold services. FedEx Office offers the Ship and Go kiosk, a convenient self-serve shipping kiosk in approximately 1,300 locations. The Ship and Go kiosk allows customers to generate a label via a mobile label or QR code and drop off packages in a secure drop bin for a seamless and efficient customer experience. FedEx Office facilitates e-commerce and returns through FedEx Returns Technology, which allows for in-store printing of return shipping labels. Through FedEx Consolidated Returns, shoppers who purchased from participating merchants can drop off the items they wish to return with no box or label required at a FedEx  Office location. For information regarding FedEx  Consolidated Returns, see 'Federal Express Segment - CustomerDriven Technology - E-Commerce and Digital Solutions.'\n\nFedEx Office also offers packing services, and packing supplies and boxes are included in its retail offerings.

      "answer": "In 2023, FedEx indicated that Network 2.0 was part of the DRIVE transformation program, and it was mentioned as a strategic initiative that could take priority over certain sustainability goals, such as achieving carbon neutrality by 2040, due to economic, regulatory, or business strategy considerations. By 2024, FedEx had implemented Network 2.0 optimization in more than 50 U.S. locations, with contracted service providers handling pickup and delivery in some areas, while employee couriers handled others. Financially, the company incurred $582 million in business optimization costs in 2024, compared to $273 million in 2023, reflecting increased investment in Network 2.0 as part of the DRIVE program. These costs were primarily related to professional fees and severance across multiple business units, showing a significant escalation in the execution phase of the transformation.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, Network 2.0 was introduced as a component of the DRIVE transformation and was positioned as a strategic initiative that could take precedence over long-term sustainability goals like carbon neutrality.",

        "Step 3: The progression from strategic positioning in 2023 to operational implementation in 2024, along with the nearly doubling of optimization costs, indicates a clear evolution in the rollout of Network 2.0 under the DRIVE program."

          "chunk_text": "## FEDEX CORPORATION\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\norganizational redesign was implemented in phases with full legal implementation effective June 1, 2024. One FedEx will help facilitate our DRIVE transformation program to improve long-term profitability.\n\nFedEx is making progress with Network 2.0, as the company has implemented Network 2.0 optimization in more than 50 locations in the U.S. Contracted service providers will handle the pickup and delivery of packages in some locations while employee couriers will handle others.\n\nWe incurred costs associated with our business optimization activities of $582 million ($444 million, net of tax , or $1.77 per diluted share) in 2024 and $273 million ($209 million, net of tax , or $0.81 per diluted share) in 2023. The costs incurred in 2024 were primarily related to professional fees and severance, and are included in Corporate, other, and eliminations, FedEx Express, and FedEx Ground. The costs incurred in 2023 were primarily related to consulting services, severance, professional fees, and idling our operations in Russia, and are included in Corporate, other, and eliminations and FedEx Express. We did not incur costs associated with our business optimization activities in 2022.\n\nIn 2021, FedEx Express announced a workforce reduction plan in Europe related to the network integration of TNT Express. The plan affected approximately 5,000 employees in Europe across operational teams and back-office functions and was completed during 2023. We incurred costs of $36 million ($27 million, net of tax, or $0.11 per diluted share) in 2023 and $278 million ($214 million, net of tax , or $0.80 per diluted share) in 2022 associated with our business realignment activities. These costs are related to certain employee severance arrangements. Payments under this program totaled approximately $118 million in 2023 and approximately $225 million in 2022. The cumulative pre-tax cost of our business realignment activities was approximately $430 million. We did not incur any costs related to business realignment activities in 2024.\n\nIn June 2024, FedEx Express announced a workforce reduction plan in Europe as part of its ongoing measures to reduce structural costs. The plan will impact between 1,700 and 2,000 employees in Europe across back-office and commercial functions. The execution of the plan is subject to a consultation process that is expected to occur over an 18-month period in accordance with local country processes and regulations. We expect the pre-tax cost of the severance benefits and legal and professional fees to be provided under and related to the plan to range from $250 million to $375 million in cash ex penditures. These charges are expected to be incurred through fiscal 2026 and will be classified as business optimization ex penses.\n\nUSE OF ESTIMATES . The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Management makes its best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to management. Areas where the nature of the estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated include self-insurance accruals, retirement plan obligations, long-term incentive accruals, tax  liabilities, loss contingencies, litigation claims, impairment assessments on long-lived assets (including goodwill) that rely on projections of future cash flows, and purchase price allocations.\n\n## NOTE 2: RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE\n\nNew accounting rules and disclosure requirements can significantly affect our reported results and the comparability of our financial statements. We believe the following new accounting guidance is relevant to the readers of our financial statements.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') issued Accounting Standards Update ('ASU') 2022-04, Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations, which requires a buyer in a supplier finance program (e.g., reverse factoring) to disclose sufficient information about the program to allow a user of financial statements to understand the program's nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period, and potential magnitude. The amendments do not affect the recognition, measurement, or financial statement presentation of obligations covered by supplier finance programs. We adopted this standard effective June 1, 2023 (fiscal 2024). The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements or internal controls. See Note 1 for further discussion about our supplier finance program obligations.",

      "answer": "In 2023, FedEx projected capital expenditures of $5.2 billion for 2025, including continued investments in Network 2.0, modernization of the Memphis and Indianapolis Hubs, and $1.3 billion for aircraft and related equipment. By 2024, the focus had shifted toward addressing integration challenges of Network 2.0, including legal risks, harmonizing operations, and managing unforeseen costs, with an emphasis on achieving operational efficiencies through the DRIVE transformation. This reflects a shift from infrastructure investment to operational integration and risk mitigation.",

The actual amount and timing of costs to be incurred and related cost savings and reductions to our permanent cost structure resulting from these initiatives and enhancements may differ from our current expectations and estimates. These initiatives and enhancements could also result in asset impairment charges and changes to our tax liabilities and deferred tax balances and subject us to litigation. If we are not able to successfully implement our DRIVE transformation our future financial results will suffer and we may not be able to achieve our financial performance goals.\n\nAll of these factors could adversely affect FedEx's results of operations and negatively affect the price of our common stock. In addition, at times the attention of certain members of our management may be focused on the DRIVE transformation and diverted from day-to-day business operations, which may disrupt our business.\n\nA significant data breach or other disruption to our technology infrastructure could disrupt our operations and result in the loss of critical sensitive or confidential information, adversely affecting our reputation, business, or results of operations. Our ability to attract and retain customers, efficiently operate our businesses, execute our DRIVE transformation, and compete effectively increasingly depend in part upon the sophistication, security, and reliability of our technology network, including our ability to provide features of service that are important to our customers, to protect our confidential business information and the information provided by our customers, and to maintain customer confidence in our ability to protect our systems and to provide services consistent with their expectations. For example, we rely on information technology to receive shipment information in advance of physical receipt of packages, to track items that move through our delivery systems, to efficiently plan deliveries, to clear shipments through customs, to execute billing processes, and to track and report financial and operational data. We are subject to risks imposed by data breaches and operational disruptions, both random and targeted, including through cyberattack or cyberintrusion, ransomware attack, malware attack, or denial of service attack by computer hackers, foreign governments and state-sponsored actors, cyber terrorists and hacktivists, cyber criminals, malicious employees or other insiders of FedEx or third-party service providers, and other groups and individuals. Data breaches and other technology disruptions of companies and governments continue to increase as the number, intensity, and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased and we, our customers, and third parties increasingly store and transmit data by means of connected information technology systems. Additionally, risks such as code anomalies, 'Acts of God,' transitional challenges in migrating operating company functionality to our FedEx enterprise automation platforms, data leakage, cyber-fraud, and human error pose a direct threat to our products, services, systems, and data and could result in unauthorized or block legitimate access to sensitive or confidential data regarding our operations, customers, employees, and suppliers, including personal information.\n\nThe technology infrastructure of acquired businesses, as well as their practices related to the use and maintenance of data, could also present issues that we were not able to identify prior to the acquisition.

      "question": "How did FedEx's assessment of the financial risks associated with Network 2.0 evolve from 2023 to 2024, and what does this indicate about the transformation's expected cost savings and execution challenges?",
      "answer": "In 2023, FedEx highlighted the potential risks of Network 2.0 primarily in terms of integration uncertainties, such as higher-than-expected costs, less-than-expected savings, customer loss, and delays. The company acknowledged that Network 2.0 was a 'multi-year effort' and noted the possibility of unexpected issues affecting the transformation\u2019s timeline and financial outcomes. By 2024, the risk assessment became more execution-focused, with specific concerns around integrating IT systems, harmonizing operating practices, and potential legal challenges that could slow the rollout. Additionally, FedEx acknowledged that the actual amount and timing of cost savings might differ from expectations and that the transformation could result in asset impairment charges. This evolution indicates that while FedEx remained confident in the long-term benefits of Network 2.0, the financial risks became more tangible and operationally complex as the transformation progressed.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, FedEx introduced Network 2.0 as part of the DRIVE transformation, noting general risks such as higher-than-expected costs and lower-than-expected savings.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, FedEx provided more specific financial risks, including potential asset impairments, delays in cost savings, and integration challenges across IT and operations.",
        "Step 3: The shift from general uncertainty in 2023 to more detailed and financially grounded risks in 2024 shows an evolution in how FedEx assessed the transformation\u2019s financial impact and execution hurdles."

      "answer": "In 2022, RTX introduced the 2.820% Notes Due 2051 with an aggregate principal balance of $1,000 million. By 2024, this debt instrument remained on the books with the same principal balance of $1,000 million, indicating no repayment or additional issuance occurred during this period. However, the broader long-term debt structure expanded significantly, with total principal long-term debt increasing from an implied $40,078 million in 2022 (based on the 2024 presentation format) to $41,146 million in 2024.

        "Step 3: The lack of change in this specific note, contrasted with an overall increase in long-term debt, indicates that RTX's relationship with this instrument remained stable while other debt instruments were added."

      "question": "How has RTX's risk exposure to Otis changed since the spin-off, particularly regarding potential tax liabilities and indemnification responsibilities?",
      "answer": "In 2022, RTX faced significant tax liability risks tied to the spin-off, with the potential for tax obligations arising if either Distribution was deemed part of a plan leading to a 50% or greater ownership change in Otis or Carrier. RTX had a tax matters agreement where Otis was required to indemnify RTX for taxes incurred if such disqualifying actions were attributable to Otis. By 2024, the indemnification framework remained intact, but RTX\u2019s disclosures emphasized a broader risk scenario, focusing on the potential inability to collect indemnification payments from Otis, which could result in significant losses. This evolution reflects a shift from primarily structural tax risk to a more financially grounded concern over enforceability and financial capacity of the indemnifying party.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 \u2014 In 2022, RTX outlined tax risks related to the spin-off and described indemnification obligations from Otis for taxes resulting from disqualifying actions.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 \u2014 In 2024, RTX maintained the indemnification framework but introduced concerns about the collectability of indemnification payments and the financial impact of failing to receive them.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change \u2014 The nature of RTX\u2019s exposure to Otis evolved from a focus on triggering events (e.g., ownership changes) to financial risk management, particularly around indemnification enforceability and financial loss mitigation."

To  preserve  the  tax-free  treatment  of  the  Distributions,  we  may  be  limited  in  our  ability  to  pursue  certain  equity issuances, strategic transactions, repurchases, or other transactions (including certain dispositions of assets) that we may otherwise believe to be in the best interests of our stockholders or that might increase the value of our business.\n\nIf Either Distribution, Together with Certain Related Transactions, Were to Fail to Qualify as a Transaction that is Generally Tax-Free, Including as a Result of Subsequent Acquisitions of Our Stock (Including Pursuant to the Raytheon Merger) or the Stock of Carrier or Otis, We Could Be Subject to Significant Tax Liabilities. We received (1) a private letter ruling from the Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  regarding  certain  U.S.  federal  income  tax  matters  relating  to  the  Separation  Transactions  and Distributions  and  (2)  an  opinion  of  outside  counsel  regarding  the  qualification  of  certain  elements  of  the  Distributions  under Section 355 of the Code. Although we intend for the Distributions generally to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, there can be no assurance that they will so qualify. Even if the Distributions were to otherwise qualify as tax-free transactions under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, either Distribution or both Distributions may result in taxable gain to us (but not our stockholders)  under  Section  355(e)  of  the  Code  if  such  Distribution(s)  were  deemed  to  be  part  of  a  plan  (or  series  of  related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, shares representing a 50% or greater interest (by vote or value) in shares of Carrier, Otis, or us, as applicable. If the IRS were to determine that any post-Distribution acquisitions of Carrier  stock,  Otis  stock,  or  our  stock,  as  applicable,  pursuant  to  such  a  plan  (when  aggregated  with  any  pre-Distribution acquisitions of Carrier stock, Otis stock, or our stock, as applicable, pursuant to such a plan) would represent a 50% or greater interest  in  shares  of  Carrier,  Otis,  or  us,  as  applicable,  such  determination  could  result  in  significant  tax  liabilities  to  us.  For purposes of this test, even if the Raytheon Merger were treated as part of such plan, it did not result in an acquisition of a 50% or greater interest in our shares pursuant to a plan. Any such tax liabilities imposed on us may adversely affect an investment in us. In addition, with respect to certain Separation Transactions, we obtained tax rulings in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions and/or opinions of external tax advisors, in each case, regarding the tax treatment of such Separation Transactions. Notwithstanding the receipt of such tax rulings and opinions, there can be no assurance that the relevant taxing authorities will not assert that the tax treatment of the relevant Separation Transactions differs from the conclusions reached therein. In the event the relevant taxing authorities prevail with any challenge in respect of any relevant Separation Transaction, we would be subject to significant tax liabilities, which may adversely  affect  an  investment  in  us.  Further,  under  a  tax  matters  agreement  that  we  entered  into  with  Carrier  and  Otis  in connection with the Separation Transactions and Distributions, each of Carrier and Otis generally is required to indemnify us for any  taxes  we  incur  resulting  from  the  Separation  Transactions  and/or  the  Distributions  to  the  extent  such  amounts  result  from certain disqualifying actions by, or acquisition of equity securities of, Carrier or Otis, as applicable. Further, under the tax matters agreement, each of Carrier and Otis is generally required to indemnify us for a specified portion of any taxes we incur (a) arising as a result of the failure of either of the Distributions and certain related transactions to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree or a failure of any Separation Transaction that is intended to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free to so qualify, in each case, to the extent such amounts did not result from a disqualifying action by, or acquisition of equity securities of, Carrier, Otis, or us or (b) arising from certain audit or other adjustments to tax liabilities incurred with respect to Separation Transactions that were not intended to qualify as tax-free. In addition, under the tax matters agreement, each of Carrier and Otis is responsible for (i) a specified portion of any installment payment we are required to make pursuant to Section 965(h)(2) of the Code and (ii) specified taxes that exclusively relate to the Carrier business or the Otis business, as applicable. The amount of any such taxes for which we would be responsible may be significant, and if we were unable to obtain indemnification payments from Carrier or Otis to which we are entitled under the tax matters agreement and/or other agreements entered into in connection with the Separation Transactions and the Distributions, we would incur significant losses.\n\n## ITEM 1B.

UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\n\nNone.\n\n## ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\n\nAs a global aerospace and defense company serving commercial and government customers in the aerospace industry and domestic and international military and government customers as a defense contractor, we are the target of advanced and persistent cyber-attacks from a variety of sources. Our products and services are highly sophisticated and specialized, involve complex advanced technologies including information technology (IT) systems, and process, store, or transmit highly sensitive unclassified and classified information. Moreover, our products and services are often integrated with third-party products and services. Cybersecurity threats include attacks on, or other attempts to infiltrate, our IT infrastructure and the IT infrastructure of our customers, suppliers, subcontractors, and other third parties, attempting to gain unauthorized access to our confidential or other proprietary information, classified information, or information relating to our employees, customers, and other third parties, or to disrupt our systems or the systems of our customers, suppliers, subcontractors, and other third parties. Cybersecurity threats also include attempts to infiltrate our products or services, such as attacks targeting the security, confidentiality, integrity or availability of the hardware, software and information installed, stored, or transmitted in our products, which may occur after the purchase of those products or when they are incorporated into third-party products, facilities, or infrastructure.\n\n## Our Cybersecurity Program\n\nGiven the nature of our business and the cybersecurity risks we face, we have a robust cybersecurity program for identifying, assessing, and managing cybersecurity risks, which include material risks from cybersecurity threats, to our internal systems, our products, services and programs for customers, and our supply chain. Our cybersecurity program is made up of two components: our enterprise cybersecurity program and our cybersecurity program for our products and services.\n\nEnterprise  Cybersecurity. Our enterprise cybersecurity program aligns with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards. Our program includes processes and controls for the deployment of new IT systems by the Company and controls over new and existing system operation. We monitor and conduct regular testing of these controls and systems, including vulnerability management through active discovery and testing to regularly assess patching and configuration status. In addition, we require our employees and contract workers to complete annual cybersecurity training, and we regularly conduct simulated phishing and cyber-related communications to educate individuals on the latest threats.\n\nProduct  and  Services  Cybersecurity. Our  product  development  processes  apply  development,  security,  and  operations  principles  aligned  with  applicable government  and  commercial  standards,  and  include  vulnerability  scanning  and  static  and  dynamic  composition  analysis.  We  regularly  assess  our  product development processes, product cyber maturity, and the teams providing our secure services in relation to cybersecurity. In addition, we strive to meet all security requirements mandated by government and commercial customers and adhere to regulatory guidance and standards for system security engineering. Many of our products also undergo industry audits and regulatory compliance certifications, and our products delivered to the Department of Defense (DoD) must comply with DoD risk management requirements.\n\nCybersecurity for Systems used in Support of U .S. Government Customers. With respect to products and services provided to, and IT systems used in connection with  programs  for,  the  U.S.  government,  our  cybersecurity  program  aligns  with  the  NIST  standards  and  meets  the  requirements  of  32  CFR  Part  117  and  other applicable U.S. government guidance. The program includes authorization and assessment of new and existing IT systems by our customers and third parties. We monitor use on these systems, including vulnerability management through patching and configuration. In addition, we restrict user access and require authorized users to complete additional user and cybersecurity training.",

This represents a 147.8% increase in the company's holding of these notes. In 2022, RTX disclosed its position in these notes as part of a broader set of fixed-rate instruments, while in 2024, the company maintained and expanded this stake despite rising interest rates and refinancing activity in other tranches. This increase suggests a strategic decision to retain or even grow exposure to this specific debt instrument, possibly as part of a broader interest rate risk management or capital optimization strategy.",

The increase in net sales due to acquisitions / divestitures, net relates to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020.\n\nThe increase in operating profit of $1.1 billion and the related increase in operating profit margins in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to a change in mix and other performance of $610 million, primarily driven by the absence of an unfavorable profit impact of $516 million in 2020 related to certain international contracts as further described below, and a change in acquisitions / divestitures, net of $521 million due to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020.\n\n## 2020 Compared with 2019\n\nThe increase in net sales of $11.4 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 was due to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020.\n\nThe increase in operating profit of $0.9 billion and the related increase in operating profit margins in 2020 compared to 2019 was due to the Raytheon Merger. Included in operating profit in 2020 was an unfavorable net impact of $516 million related to certain international contracts as further described below, and a $25 million net favorable EAC adjustment due to a revised estimate in costs to complete an industrial cooperation agreement obligation on multiple contracts for an international customer based upon an agreement signed in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, RMD reversed $119 million of sales for work performed subsequent to the date of the Raytheon Merger through the end of the third quarter of 2020, and the related operating profit, on our direct commercial sales contracts for precision guided munitions with a certain Middle East customer, for which we have not yet obtained regulatory approval. Due to the U.S. presidential and congressional elections and the resulting uncertainty surrounding U.S. foreign policy on direct commercial sales for precision guided munitions with this customer, we determined that it was no longer probable that we will be able to obtain regulatory  approvals  for  these  contracts.  RMD  also  recognized  an  unfavorable  profit  impact  of  $516  million  related  to  these contracts, primarily related to inventory reserves, contract asset impairments and recognition of supplier related obligations related to termination liability, which we do not expect to be utilized or otherwise directed to other customers. In addition, we reversed $755 million of backlog on these contracts.\n\nBacklog and Bookings - Backlog was $29 billion at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. In 2021, RMD booked $3.2 billion on a number  of  classified  contracts,  including  approximately  $2  billion  for  the  Long  Range  Standoff  (LRSO)  Weapon  System Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract for the U.S. Air Force. RMD also booked $1,315 million for the NGI  program  for  the  Missile  Defense  Agency  (MDA),  $1,088  million  for  the  Advanced  Medium  Range  Air-to-Air  Missile (AMRAAM) for the U.S. Air Force and Navy and international customers, $729 million for Standard Missile-2 (SM-2) for the U.S. Navy  and  international  customers,  $627  million  for  Evolved  Seasparrow  Missile  (ESSM)  for  the  U.S.  Navy  and  international customers, $432 million to provide Guidance Enhanced Missiles (GEM-T) for an international customer, $327 million for AIM-9X Sidewinder short-range air-to-air missiles for the U.S. Navy and Air Force and international customers, $291 million for Stinger missiles  for  international  customers,  $247  million  to  provide  Patriot  engineering  services  support  for  the  U.S.  Army  and international customers, $242 million on the Army Navy/Transportable Radar Surveillance-Model 2 (AN/TPY-2) radar program for the MDA, $213 million for StormBreaker for the U.S. Air Force and Navy, $175 million to provide Patriot technical assistance for an international customer, and $164 million for the Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) program for the U.S. Navy.",

      "question": "How did Honeywell's 2006 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors evolve between 2022 and 2024 in terms of the specific forms of award agreements offered, and what might this suggest about changes in the company's non-employee director compensation structure?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Honeywell's 10-K filing listed both the 'Form of Option Agreement' (Exhibit 10.30) and the 'Form of Restricted Unit Agreement' (Exhibit 10.32) as part of the 2006 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors. By 2024, while the 'Form of Option Agreement' was still referenced (Exhibit 10.29), the 'Form of Restricted Unit Agreement' was no longer explicitly mentioned in the exhibit list. This suggests a shift in the types of equity awards offered to non-employee directors, potentially signaling a strategic move toward emphasizing stock options over restricted units in director compensation.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, both Option Agreements (Exhibit 10.30) and Restricted Unit Agreements (Exhibit 10.32) were explicitly listed as part of the 2006 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the Option Agreement (Exhibit 10.29) remained as a referenced document under the 2006 plan, but the Restricted Unit Agreement was no longer listed among the plan's exhibits.",
        "Step 3: The removal of the Restricted Unit Agreement from the list of explicitly referenced exhibits indicates a change in the plan's structure or emphasis, suggesting a strategic shift in the form of compensation offered to non-employee directors."

      "question": "How did the composition and strategic emphasis of HON's U.S. cash balances evolve between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of total cash holdings and geographic distribution of funds?",
      "answer": "In 2022, HON reported holding $11.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2021, with an emphasis on safety of principal and diversification among counterparties. By 2024, the company held $11.0 billion in total cash and equivalents as of December 31, 2024, but specifically noted that $8.0 billion of that amount was held in non-U.S. subsidiaries. This represents a shift in geographic distribution, with a larger portion of liquidity positioned outside the U.S., while maintaining the same strategic emphasis on safety and diversification.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, HON held $11.5 billion in cash and equivalents as of December 31, 2021, with no specific breakdown of U.S. vs. non-U.S. holdings.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, HON held $11.0 billion total in cash and equivalents as of December 31, 2024, with $8.0 billion explicitly held in non-U.S. subsidiaries.",
        "Step 3: The total cash balance remained relatively stable, but the geographic composition shifted significantly, with a notable increase in the proportion of funds held internationally."

      "question": "How has Honeywell's documentation and treatment of the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan - Stock Option Award Agreement, Form 2 evolved between the 2022 and 2024 SEC filings, and what does this evolution suggest about their executive compensation disclosure strategy?",
      "answer": "In the 2022 filing (HON_10k_2022.pdf), the '2011 Stock Incentive Plan of Honeywell International Inc. and Its Affiliates - Form of Stock Option Award Agreement, Form 2' was listed as Exhibit 10.46 and referenced as being incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.39 from the 2014 10-K filing. In the 2024 filing (HON_10k_2024.pdf), the same agreement is reclassified under Exhibit 10.39 and continues to reference the 2014 10-K filing as the source document. However, the exhibit is now grouped more closely with other core plan amendments and appears to be part of a broader reorganization of compensation-related disclosures. This suggests a strategic shift toward consolidating and streamlining executive compensation documentation for greater clarity and governance oversight.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Exhibit 10.46 was the designated identifier for the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan - Stock Option Award Agreement, Form 2, referencing Exhibit 10.39 from the 2014 10-K.",
        "Step 2: By 2024, the same agreement was reclassified under Exhibit 10.39 and appeared in a section with other amendments and forms directly tied to the 2011 plan.",
        "Step 3: The reclassification and contextual grouping of the agreement in 2024 indicates a more integrated and governance-focused approach to documenting stock incentive plans."

      "answer": "Honeywell maintained a consistent capital stock structure with no conversion rights for common shareowners in both 2022 and 2024, which supports a stable framework for share repurchases. In 2022, $7.1 billion remained under a $10 billion repurchase authorization approved in February 2021. By 2024, a new $10.0 billion repurchase authorization was approved in April 2023, with $5.5 billion remaining as of year-end. This indicates a sustained commitment to returning capital to shareholders through repurchases, with a new authorization replacing the prior one and continuing the company\u2019s strategy without altering the underlying accounting policy related to conversion rights.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, Honeywell had $7.1 billion remaining under a $10 billion share repurchase authorization approved in February 2021, with no conversion rights for common shareholders.",

        "Step 3: The consistent policy on conversion rights supports a stable capital structure, while the continuation of large-scale repurchase programs indicates an ongoing, and newly reinforced, capital return strategy."

      "question": "How has the influence of investor preferences on GE's Power business evolved between 2022 and 2023, particularly in relation to the competitiveness of fossil fuel-based power generation?",
      "answer": "In 2022, investor preferences were described as negatively impacting GE's Power business due to declining demand for fossil fuel-based power generation, such as new gas turbines, driven by investor favor toward renewables like wind and solar. By 2023, the relationship evolved to 'Depends_On,' indicating that GE's strategic direction became more contingent on investor preferences, especially as they influence the pace and scale of adoption of low-carbon technologies like hydrogen-based power generation and carbon capture. This shift reflects a transition from investor sentiment being a barrier to it becoming a critical enabler of GE's energy transition strategy.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, investor preferences were identified as a negative force affecting the competitiveness of GE's fossil fuel-based power offerings, particularly gas turbines, due to increasing investor focus on renewables.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the relationship evolved to 'Depends_On,' indicating that GE's ability to navigate the energy transition and develop new technologies (e.g., hydrogen-based power generation) became increasingly tied to investor support and policy incentives.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a shift from investor preferences acting as a headwind to becoming a pivotal factor that GE must align with to advance its decarbonization goals and maintain competitiveness."

          "chunk_text": "Global macro-environment - Our growth is subject to global economic, political and geopolitical risks. We operate in virtually every part of the world, serve customers in over 175 countries and received 56% of our revenues for 2021 from outside the United States. Our operations and the execution of our business plans and strategies are subject to the effects of global economic trends, geopolitical risks and demand or supply shocks from events that could include war, a major terrorist attack, natural disasters or actual or threatened public health emergencies (such as COVID-19). They are also affected by local and regional economic environments and policies in the U.S. and other markets that we serve, including interest rates, monetary policy, inflation, economic growth, recession, commodity prices, currency volatility, currency controls or other limitations on the ability to expatriate cash, sovereign debt levels and actual or anticipated defaults on sovereign debt. For example, changes in local economic conditions or outlooks, such as lower rates of investment or economic growth in China, Europe or other key markets, affect the demand for or profitability of our products and services outside the U.S., and the impact on the Company could be significant given the extent of our activities outside the United States. Political changes and trends such as populism, protectionism, economic nationalism and sentiment toward multinational companies and resulting tariffs, export controls or other trade barriers, or changes to tax or other laws and policies, have been and may continue to be disruptive and costly to our businesses, and these can interfere with our global operating model, supply chain, production costs, customer relationships and competitive position. Further escalation of specific trade tensions, including intensified decoupling between the U.S. and China, or in global trade conflict more broadly could be harmful to global economic growth or to our business in or with China or other countries, and related decreases in confidence or investment activity in the global markets would adversely affect our business performance. We also do business in many emerging market jurisdictions where economic, political and legal risks are heightened.\n\nEnergy transition - The strategic priorities and financial performance of some of our businesses are subject to market and other dynamics related to decarbonization, which can pose risks in addition to opportunities for those businesses. Given the nature of our businesses and the industries we serve, we must anticipate and respond to market, technological, regulatory and other changes driven by broader trends related to decarbonization efforts in response to climate change. These changes present both risks and opportunities for our businesses, many of which provide products and services to customers in sectors like power generation and commercial aviation that have historically been carbon intensive and will remain important to efforts globally to lower greenhouse gas emissions for decades to come. For example, the significant decreases in recent years in the levelized cost of energy for renewable sources of power generation (such as wind and solar), along with ongoing changes in government, investor, customer and consumer policies, commitments, preferences and considerations related to climate change, in some cases have adversely affected, and are expected to continue to affect, the demand for and the competitiveness of products and services related to fossil fuel-based power generation, including sales of new gas turbines and the utilization and servicing needs for existing gas power plants. Continued shifts toward greater penetration by renewables in both new capacity additions and the proportionate share of power generation, particularly depending on the pace and timeframe for such shifts across different markets globally, could have a material adverse effect on the performance of our Power business and our consolidated results. And while the anticipated market growth and power generation share for renewable energy over time is favorable for our wind businesses, there too we face uncertainties related to the future anticipated levels and timeframes of government subsidies and credits (such as the U.S. wind Production Tax Credit), significant price competition among wind equipment manufacturers, dynamics between onshore and offshore wind power, potential further consolidation in the wind industry, competition with other sources of renewable energy such as solar power-based electricity generation and the pace at which power grids are modernized to maintain reliability with higher levels of renewables penetration.\n\nIn addition, the achievement of deep decarbonization goals for the power sector over the coming decades is likely to depend in part on technologies that are not yet deployed or widely adopted today but that may become more important over time (such as grid-scale batteries or other storage solutions, hydrogen-based power generation, carbon capture and sequestration technologies or small modular or other advanced nuclear power). This is likely to require significant investments in power grids and other infrastructure, research and development and new technology and products, both by GE and third parties. The process of developing new hightechnology products and enhancing existing products to mitigate climate change is often complex, costly and uncertain, and we may pursue strategies or make investments that do not prove to be commercially successful. Similar dynamics exist in the aviation sector, where decarbonization over time will require a combination of continued technological innovation in the fuel efficiency of engines, expanding the use of sustainable aviation fuels in next generation engines and the development of electric flight and hydrogen-based aviation technologies. A failure to invest properly in these technological developments, or to adequately position our businesses to benefit from the growth in adoption of new technologies, could adversely affect our competitive position, business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, there are increasing scrutiny and expectations from many customers, governments, regulators, investors, banks, project financers and other stakeholders regarding the roles that the private sector and individual companies play in decarbonization, and this can pose reputational or other risks for companies like GE that serve carbon intensive industries or relative to progress that we make over time in reducing emissions from our operations or products. Trends related to the global energy transition and decarbonization, including the relative competitiveness of different types of product and service offerings within and across our energy businesses, as well as for GE Aviation, will continue to be impacted in ways that are uncertain by factors such as the pace of technological developments and related cost considerations, the levels of economic growth in different markets around the world and the adoption of climate change-related policies (such as carbon taxes, cap and trade regimes, increased efficiency standards, greenhouse gas emission reduction targets or commitments, incentives or mandates for particular types of energy or policies that impact the availability of financing for certain types of projects) at the national and sub-national levels or by customers, investors or other private actors.\n\nCompetitive environment - We are dependent on the maintenance of existing product lines and service relationships, market acceptance of new product and service introductions, and technology and innovation leadership for revenue and earnings growth. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive in terms of pricing, product and service quality, product development and introduction time, customer service, financing terms, the ability to respond to shifts in market demand and the ability to attract and",

          "chunk_text": "Global macro-environment - Our growth is subject to global economic, political and geopolitical risks. We operate in virtually every part of the world, serve customers in over 175 countries and received 56% of our revenues for 2021 from outside the United States. Our operations and the execution of our business plans and strategies are subject to the effects of global economic trends, geopolitical risks and demand or supply shocks from events that could include war, a major terrorist attack, natural disasters or actual or threatened public health emergencies (such as COVID-19). They are also affected by local and regional economic environments and policies in the U.S. and other markets that we serve, including interest rates, monetary policy, inflation, economic growth, recession, commodity prices, currency volatility, currency controls or other limitations on the ability to expatriate cash, sovereign debt levels and actual or anticipated defaults on sovereign debt. For example, changes in local economic conditions or outlooks, such as lower rates of investment or economic growth in China, Europe or other key markets, affect the demand for or profitability of our products and services outside the U.S., and the impact on the Company could be significant given the extent of our activities outside the United States. Political changes and trends such as populism, protectionism, economic nationalism and sentiment toward multinational companies and resulting tariffs, export controls or other trade barriers, or changes to tax or other laws and policies, have been and may continue to be disruptive and costly to our businesses, and these can interfere with our global operating model, supply chain, production costs, customer relationships and competitive position. Further escalation of specific trade tensions, including intensified decoupling between the U.S. and China, or in global trade conflict more broadly could be harmful to global economic growth or to our business in or with China or other countries, and related decreases in confidence or investment activity in the global markets would adversely affect our business performance. We also do business in many emerging market jurisdictions where economic, political and legal risks are heightened.\n\nEnergy transition - The strategic priorities and financial performance of some of our businesses are subject to market and other dynamics related to decarbonization, which can pose risks in addition to opportunities for those businesses. Given the nature of our businesses and the industries we serve, we must anticipate and respond to market, technological, regulatory and other changes driven by broader trends related to decarbonization efforts in response to climate change. These changes present both risks and opportunities for our businesses, many of which provide products and services to customers in sectors like power generation and commercial aviation that have historically been carbon intensive and will remain important to efforts globally to lower greenhouse gas emissions for decades to come. For example, the significant decreases in recent years in the levelized cost of energy for renewable sources of power generation (such as wind and solar), along with ongoing changes in government, investor, customer and consumer policies, commitments, preferences and considerations related to climate change, in some cases have adversely affected, and are expected to continue to affect, the demand for and the competitiveness of products and services related to fossil fuel-based power generation, including sales of new gas turbines and the utilization and servicing needs for existing gas power plants. Continued shifts toward greater penetration by renewables in both new capacity additions and the proportionate share of power generation, particularly depending on the pace and timeframe for such shifts across different markets globally, could have a material adverse effect on the performance of our Power business and our consolidated results. And while the anticipated market growth and power generation share for renewable energy over time is favorable for our wind businesses, there too we face uncertainties related to the future anticipated levels and timeframes of government subsidies and credits (such as the U.S. wind Production Tax Credit), significant price competition among wind equipment manufacturers, dynamics between onshore and offshore wind power, potential further consolidation in the wind industry, competition with other sources of renewable energy such as solar power-based electricity generation and the pace at which power grids are modernized to maintain reliability with higher levels of renewables penetration.\n\nIn addition, the achievement of deep decarbonization goals for the power sector over the coming decades is likely to depend in part on technologies that are not yet deployed or widely adopted today but that may become more important over time (such as grid-scale batteries or other storage solutions, hydrogen-based power generation, carbon capture and sequestration technologies or small modular or other advanced nuclear power). This is likely to require significant investments in power grids and other infrastructure, research and development and new technology and products, both by GE and third parties. The process of developing new hightechnology products and enhancing existing products to mitigate climate change is often complex, costly and uncertain, and we may pursue strategies or make investments that do not prove to be commercially successful. Similar dynamics exist in the aviation sector, where decarbonization over time will require a combination of continued technological innovation in the fuel efficiency of engines, expanding the use of sustainable aviation fuels in next generation engines and the development of electric flight and hydrogen-based aviation technologies. A failure to invest properly in these technological developments, or to adequately position our businesses to benefit from the growth in adoption of new technologies, could adversely affect our competitive position, business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, there are increasing scrutiny and expectations from many customers, governments, regulators, investors, banks, project financers and other stakeholders regarding the roles that the private sector and individual companies play in decarbonization, and this can pose reputational or other risks for companies like GE that serve carbon intensive industries or relative to progress that we make over time in reducing emissions from our operations or products. Trends related to the global energy transition and decarbonization, including the relative competitiveness of different types of product and service offerings within and across our energy businesses, as well as for GE Aviation, will continue to be impacted in ways that are uncertain by factors such as the pace of technological developments and related cost considerations, the levels of economic growth in different markets around the world and the adoption of climate change-related policies (such as carbon taxes, cap and trade regimes, increased efficiency standards, greenhouse gas emission reduction targets or commitments, incentives or mandates for particular types of energy or policies that impact the availability of financing for certain types of projects) at the national and sub-national levels or by customers, investors or other private actors.\n\nCompetitive environment - We are dependent on the maintenance of existing product lines and service relationships, market acceptance of new product and service introductions, and technology and innovation leadership for revenue and earnings growth. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive in terms of pricing, product and service quality, product development and introduction time, customer service, financing terms, the ability to respond to shifts in market demand and the ability to attract and",

      "answer": "In 2023, military derivative aircraft were included among other long-term contract products within the BDS segment, with no specific financial figures disclosed for this category alone. By 2024, Boeing explicitly noted that firm orders include certain military derivative aircraft not included in program accounting quantities, and clarified that all revenues and costs associated with their production are reported under the BDS segment. This represents a shift toward more transparent and specific disclosure around military derivative aircraft, though no direct financial figures are provided for comparison.",

By 2024, the leadership transition had been completed, with Dehoff moving to lead Connected Enterprise, signaling a shift in executive focus away from Productivity Solutions and Services. Financial performance further reflects this evolution: sales for the segment dropped from $1,313 million in 2023 to $1,202 million in 2024, continuing a downward trend from $1,739 million in 2022. This combination of leadership realignment and declining sales suggests a reduced strategic emphasis on the Productivity Solutions and Services segment within Honeywell\u2019s broader portfolio.",

      "question": "How has the composition and scale of Union Pacific's retention share and unit awards changed between 2022 and 2023, and what does this indicate about the company's executive compensation strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Union Pacific disclosed that 389,207 retention shares were outstanding under the 2021 Stock Incentive Plan as of December 31, 2021. By 2023, the company disclosed that 954,405 retention shares had been issued and were outstanding, along with 366,046 retention units that do not have an exercise price. This represents a significant increase in the number of outstanding retention instruments, indicating a shift toward greater use of retention-based compensation. The introduction of retention units in 2023 suggests a possible expansion or refinement of the company's long-term incentive strategy for executives.",

This expense is subject to achievement of the performance measures established for the performance stock unit grants.\n\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan - Our ESPP started in July 2021. Employee and Company contributions are used to issue treasury shares the month after employee contributions are withheld based on the settlement date closing price. The Company matches 40% contributed by the employee up to a maximum employee contribution of 5% of monthly salary (limited to $15,000 annually). We expense the Company contributions in the month the employee services were rendered (i.e., the month the employee contributions were withheld).\n\n## 5. Retirement Plans\n\n## Pension Benefits\n\nWe provide defined benefit retirement income to eligible non-union employees through qualified and non-qualified (supplemental) pension plans. Qualified and non-qualified pension benefits are based on years of service and the highest compensation during the latest years of employment, with specific reductions made for early retirements. Non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2018, are no longer eligible for pension benefits, but are eligible for an enhanced 401(k) benefit as described below in other retirement programs.\n\n## Funded Status\n\nWe are required by GAAP to separately recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our pension plans as an asset or liability. The funded status represents the difference between the projected benefit obligation (PBO) and the fair value of the plan assets. Our non-qualified (supplemental) pension plan is unfunded by design. The PBO of the pension plans is the present value of benefits earned to date by plan participants, including the effect of assumed future compensation increases. Plan assets are measured at fair value. We use a December 31 measurement date for plan assets and obligations for all our retirement plans.",

      "answer": "In the 2022 reporting period, Union Pacific disclosed capital investments of $2.9 billion for 2021. In the 2023 reporting period, the company disclosed capitalized costs to Properties, net of $3.8 billion for 2022. This represents an increase of $0.9 billion, or approximately 31%, in capital investments over the two reporting periods. The increase suggests a more aggressive asset management strategy, with greater emphasis on replacing, upgrading, and expanding the company's asset base to enhance operational efficiency, safety, and network capacity.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Union Pacific Corporation\n\n## Opinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Union Pacific Corporation and Subsidiary Companies (the \"Corporation\") as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in common shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years  in  the  period  ended  December  31,  2021,  and  the  related  notes  (collectively  referred  to  as  the  \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Corporation as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)  (PCAOB),  the  Corporation's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  December  31,  2021,  based  on criteria  established  in Internal  Control -Integrated  Framework  (2013) issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission  and  our  report  dated  February  4,  2022,  expressed  an  unqualified opinion on the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement,  whether  due  to  error  or  fraud.  Our  audits  included  performing  procedures  to  assess  the  risks  of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures  in  the  financial  statements.  Our  audits  also  included  evaluating  the  accounting  principles  used  and significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  presentation  of  the  financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe  critical  audit  matter  communicated  below  is  a  matter  arising  from  the  current-period  audit  of  the  financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to  the  financial  statements  and  (2)  involved  our  especially  challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Capitalization of Properties -Refer to Notes 2 and 11 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe  Corporation's  operations  are  highly  capital  intensive  and  their  large  network  of  assets  turns  over  on  a continuous basis. Each year, the Corporation develops a capital program for both the replacement of assets and for the acquisition or construction of new assets. In determining whether costs should be capitalized, the Corporation exercises significant judgment in determining whether expenditures meet the applicable minimum units of property criteria and extend the useful life, improve the safety of operations, or improve the operating efficiency of existing assets. The Corporation capitalizes all costs of capital projects necessary to make assets ready for their intended use and because a portion of the Corporation's assets are self-constructed, management also exercises significant judgment  in  determining  the  amount  of  material,  labor,  work  equipment,  and  indirect  costs  that  qualify  for capitalization. Properties, net were $54,871 million as of December 31, 2021 and, during 2021, the Corporation's capital investments were $2.9 billion.\n\nWe identified the capitalization of property as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgment exercised by management in determining whether costs meet the criteria for capitalization. This, in turn, required a high degree of auditor judgment when performing audit procedures to evaluate whether the criteria to capitalize costs were met and to evaluate sufficiency of audit evidence to support management's conclusions.",

          "chunk_text": "\nThe pension plan investments are  held  in  a  master  trust. The  investment  strategy  for  pension  plan  assets  is  to maintain  a  broadly  diversified  portfolio  designed  to  achieve  our  target  average  long-term  rate  of  return  of 6.25%. While we believe we can achieve a long-term average rate of return of 6.25%, we cannot be certain that the portfolio  will  perform  to  our  expectations.  Assets  are  strategically  allocated  among  equity,  debt,  and  other investments  in  order  to  achieve  a  diversification  level  that  reduces  fluctuations  in  investment  returns.  Asset allocation  target  ranges  for  equity,  debt,  and  other  portfolios  are  evaluated  at  least  every  three  years  with  the assistance  of  an  independent  consulting  firm.  Actual  asset  allocations  are  monitored  monthly,  and  rebalancing actions are executed at least quarterly, as needed.\n\nSince 2020, the asset allocation targets for equity and debt have been adjusted annually to move from equity to debt  as  a  de-risking  measure.  The  current  target  endpoint  for  this  de-risking  is  45%  equity  and  55%  debt  in 2023. Equity risks are balanced by investing a significant portion of the plans' assets in high-quality debt securities. The average credit rating of the debt portfolio was A+ and A at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The debt portfolio is also broadly diversified and invested primarily in U.S. Treasury, mortgage, and corporate securities. The weighted-average  maturity  of  the  debt  portfolio  was  20  years  and  17  years  at  December  31,  2021  and  2020, respectively.\n\nThe investment of pension plan assets in securities issued by UPC is explicitly prohibited by the plan for both the equity and debt portfolios, other than through index fund holdings.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nThe pension plan assets are valued at fair value. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value, including the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.\n\nTemporary Cash Investments - These investments consist of U.S. dollars, foreign currencies, and commercial paper  held  in  master  trust  accounts  at  The  Northern  Trust  Company  (the  Trustee).  Foreign  currencies  held  are reported in terms of U.S. dollars based on currency exchange rates readily available in active markets. U.S. dollars and  foreign  currencies  are  classified  as  Level  1  investments.  Commercial  paper  assets  are  valued  using  a  bid evaluation process with bid data provided by independent pricing sources. Commercial paper is classified as Level 2 investments.\n\nRegistered  Investment  Companies -  Registered  Investment  Companies  are  entities  primarily  engaged  in  the business of investing in securities and are registered with the SEC. The plan's holdings of Registered Investment Companies include both public and private fund vehicles. The public vehicles are exchange-traded funds (stocks), which are classified as Level 1 investments. The private vehicles (bonds) do not have published pricing and are valued using Net Asset Value (NAV).\n\nFederal Government Securities - Federal Government Securities consist of bills, notes, bonds, and other fixed income securities issued directly by the U.S. Treasury or by government-sponsored enterprises. These assets are valued using a bid evaluation process with bid data provided by independent pricing sources. Federal Government Securities are classified as Level 2 investments.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GE had an active stake in Electric Insurance Company (EIC), which operated as a property and casualty insurance company primarily serving GE and its employees, with net claim reserves of $0.2 billion. By 2024, GE had classified EIC as held for sale and ultimately completed its sale to Riverstone International Holdings Inc. for $120 million in cash. This reflects a complete transition from ownership and operational involvement to full divestiture.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, GE maintained a direct stake in EIC, which was actively operating with $0.2 billion in net claim reserves.",
        "Step 2: By 2024, GE no longer held EIC as an operational asset, instead completing its sale for $120 million, indicating a strategic exit.",
        "Step 3: The change represents a transformation from a direct operational relationship to a post-sale disposition, marking a significant shift in GE's strategic focus away from captive insurance."

          "chunk_text": "## OTHER ITEMS\n\nINSURANCE. The run-off insurance operations of North American Life and Health (NALH) primarily include Employers Reassurance Corporation (ERAC) and Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC). ERAC primarily assumes long-term care insurance and life insurance from numerous cedents under various types of reinsurance treaties and stopped accepting new policies after 2008. UFLIC primarily assumes long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities with and without life contingencies and variable annuities from Genworth Financial Inc.(Genworth) and has been closed to new business since 2004. The vast majority of NALH's reinsurance exposures are long-duration arrangements that still involve substantial levels of premium collections and benefit payments even though ERAC and UFLIC have not entered into new reinsurance treaties in more than a decade. These long-duration arrangements involve a number of direct writers and contain a range of risk transfer provisions and other contractual elements. In many instances, these arrangements do not transfer to us 100 percent of the risk embodied in the encompassed underlying policies issued by the direct writers. Furthermore, we cede insurance risk to third-party reinsurers for a portion of our insurance contracts, primarily on longterm care insurance policies.\n\nOur run-off insurance liabilities and annuity benefits primarily comprise a liability for future policy benefits for those insurance contract claims not yet incurred and claim reserves for claims that have been incurred or are estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported. The insurance liabilities and annuity benefits amounted to $37.2 billion and $42.2 billion and primarily relate to individual long- term care insurance reserves of $21.7 billion and $21.3 billion and structured settlement annuities and life insurance reserves of $10.3 billion and $10.7 billion, at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in insurance liabilities and annuity benefits of $5.0 billion from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 is primarily due to an adjustment of $4.8 billion resulting from the higher margin from the 2021 premium deficiency test and the decline in unrealized gains on investment securities that would result in a premium deficiency should those gains be realized.\n\nIn addition to NALH, Electric Insurance Company (EIC) is a property and casualty insurance company primarily providing insurance to GE and its employees with net claim reserves of $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nWe regularly monitor emerging experience in our run-off insurance operations and industry developments to identify trends that may help us refine our reserve assumptions. We believe recent elevated mortality across our portfolio and lower long-term care insurance claims are short term in nature and attributable to COVID-19. However, the effects of COVID-19, including the continued emergence of variants and success of vaccinations, remain uncertain and may result in variability in levels of future mortality and long-term care insurance claims activity, including changes in policyholder behavior (e.g., policyholder willingness to enter long-term care facilities or seek care at home), among others. These monitoring activities also allow us to evaluate opportunities to reduce our insurance risk profile and improve the results of our run-off insurance operations. Such opportunities may include the pursuit of future premium rate increases and benefit reductions on long-term care insurance contracts in accordance with our reinsurance contracts with our ceding companies; recapture and reinsurance transactions to reduce risk where economically justified; investment strategies to improve asset and liability matching and enhance investment portfolio yields; and managing our expense levels.\n\n## Key Portfolio Characteristics\n\nLong-term care insurance contracts. The long-term care insurance contracts we reinsure provide coverage at varying levels of benefits to policyholders and may include attributes that could result in claimants being on claim for longer periods or at higher daily claim costs, or alternatively limiting the premium paying period, compared to contracts with a lower level of benefits. For example, policyholders with a lifetime benefit period could receive coverage up to the specified daily maximum as long as the policyholder is claim eligible and receives care for covered services; inflation protection options increase the daily maximums to protect the policyholder from the rising cost of care with some options providing automatic annual increases of 3% to 5% or policyholder elected inflation-indexed increases for increased premium; joint life policies provide coverage for two lives which permit either life under a single contract to receive benefits at the same time or separately; and premium payment options may limit the period over which the policyholder pays premiums while still receiving coverage after premium payments cease, which may limit the impact of our benefit from future premium rate increases.\n\nThe ERAC long-term care insurance portfolio comprises more than two-thirds of our total long-term care insurance reserves and is assumed from approximately 30 ceding companies through various types of reinsurance and retrocession contracts having complex terms and conditions. Compared to the overall long-term care insurance block, it has a lower average attained age and more policies (and covered lives, as over one-third of the policies are joint life policies) with lifetime benefit periods and/or with inflation protection options which may result in a higher potential for future claims.\n\nThe UFLIC long-term care insurance block comprises the remainder of our total long-term care insurance reserves and is more mature with policies that are more uniform, as it is assumed from a single ceding company, Genworth, and has fewer policies with lifetime benefit periods, no joint life policies and slightly more policies with inflation protection options.\n\nPresented in the table below are GAAP and statutory reserve balances and key attributes of our long-term care insurance portfolio.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GE disclosed plans to monetize its equity ownership position in AerCap, indicating a strategic move to divest its stake. By 2024, GE still held a financial stake in AerCap, with the estimated fair value of the equity note in AerCap listed at $982 million as of December 31, 2024, up from $944 million as of December 31, 2023. This suggests that while GE had initially intended to exit or reduce its position in AerCap, it had not fully divested by 2024 and maintained a notable financial interest, potentially signaling a continued strategic or financial relationship.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, GE stated its intent to monetize its equity ownership in AerCap, signaling a strategic shift away from holding a stake in the company.",

          "chunk_text": "retain skilled talent. Our long-term operating results and competitive position also depend substantially upon our ability to continually develop, introduce, and market new and innovative technology, products, services and platforms, to develop digital solutions for our own operations and our customers, to modify existing products and services, to customize products and services, to maintain longterm customer relationships and to increase our productivity over time as we perform on long-term service agreements. A failure to appropriately plan for these dynamics may adversely affect our delivery of products, services and outcomes in line with our projected financial performance or cost estimates, and ultimately may result in excess costs, build-up of inventory that becomes obsolete, lower profit margins and an erosion of our competitive position. Our businesses are subject to technological change and advances, such as growth in industrial automation and increased digitization of the operations, infrastructure and solutions that customers demand across all the industries we serve. The introduction of innovative and disruptive technologies in the markets in which we operate also poses risks in the form of new competitors (including new entrants from outside our traditional industries, such as competitors from digital technology companies), market consolidation, substitutions of existing products, services or solutions, niche players, new business models and competitors that are faster to market with new or more cost-effective products or services. Existing and new competitors are frequently offering services for our installed base, and this can erode the revenues and profitability of our businesses if we fail to maintain or enter into new services relationships with customers that purchase our equipment and products. In addition, the research and development cycle involved in bringing products in our businesses to market is often lengthy, it is inherently difficult to predict the economic conditions and competitive dynamics that will exist when any new product is complete, and our investments, to the extent they result in bringing a product to market, may generate weaker returns than we anticipated at the outset. Our capacity to invest in research and development efforts to pursue advancement in a wide range of technologies, products and services also depends on the financial resources that we have available for such investment relative to other capital allocation priorities. Underinvestment in research and development, or investment in technologies that prove to be less competitive in the future (at the expense of alternative investment opportunities not pursued), could lead to loss of sales of our products and services in the future, particularly in our long-cycle businesses that have longer product development cycles. The amounts that we do invest in research and development efforts may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings.\n\nBusiness portfolio - Our success depends on achieving our strategic and financial objectives, including through acquisitions, integrations, dispositions and joint ventures. With respect to acquisitions and business integrations, such as our Healthcare business's recent acquisition of BK Medical, or with joint ventures and business integrations, we may not achieve expected returns and other benefits on a timely basis or at all as a result of changes in strategy, integration challenges or other factors. Over the past several years we have also been pursuing a variety of dispositions, including the ongoing monetization of our remaining equity ownership position in Baker Hughes and our plans to monetize our equity ownership position in AerCap. Declines in the values of equity interests (such as our interests in Baker Hughes and AerCap) or other assets that we sell can diminish the cash proceeds that we realize. We may dispose of businesses or assets at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated, or with purchase price adjustments or the exclusion of assets or liabilities that must be divested, managed or run off separately. Dispositions or other business separations also often involve continued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through continuing equity ownership, retained assets or liabilities, transition services agreements, commercial agreements, guarantees, indemnities or other current or contingent financial obligations or liabilities. Under these arrangements, performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside our control could materially affect our future financial results. Executing on all types of portfolio transactions can divert senior management time and resources from other pursuits. We also participate in a number of joint ventures with other companies or government enterprises in various markets around the world, including joint ventures where we have a lesser degree of control over the business operations, which expose us to additional operational, financial, reputational, legal or compliance risks.\n\nIntellectual property - Our intellectual property portfolio may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to ours, and the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted by external dependencies. Our patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing or selling products and services similar to or duplicative of ours, and there can be no assurance that the resources invested by us to protect our intellectual property will be sufficient or that our intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of our technology. Trademark licenses of the GE brand in connection with dispositions may negatively impact the overall value of the brand in the future. We also face competition in some countries where we have not invested in an intellectual property portfolio. If we are not able to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected. We also face attempts, both internally from insider threats and externally from cyberattacks, to gain unauthorized access to our IT systems or products for the purpose of improperly acquiring our trade secrets or confidential business information. In addition, we have observed an increase in the use of social engineering tactics by bad actors attempting to obtain confidential business information or credentials to access systems with our intellectual property. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such incidents could adversely affect our competitive position and the value of our investment in research and development. In addition, we are subject to the enforcement of patents or other intellectual property by third parties, including aggressive and opportunistic enforcement claims by non-practicing entities. Regardless of the merit of such claims, responding to infringement claims can be expensive and timeconsuming.

          "chunk_text": "We also enter into long-term services agreements in our Healthcare and Renewable Energy segments. Revenues are recognized for these arrangements on a straight-line basis consistent with the nature, timing and extent of our services, which primarily relate to routine maintenance and as needed equipment repairs. We generally invoice periodically as services are provided.\n\nPerformance Obligations Satisfied at a Point in Time. We sell certain tangible products, largely spare parts, through our services businesses. We recognize revenues and bill our customers at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the good, which is at the point in time we deliver the spare part to the customer.\n\nCOLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS. Our Aviation business enters into collaborative arrangements and joint ventures with manufacturers and suppliers of components used to build and maintain certain engines. Under these arrangements, GE and its collaborative partners share in the risks and rewards of these programs through various revenue, cost and profit sharing payment structures. GE recognizes revenue and costs for these arrangements based on the scope of work GE is responsible for transferring to its customers. GE's payments to participants are primarily recorded as either cost of services sold ($2,125 million, $2,407 million and $3,517 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively) or as cost of equipment sold ($751 million, $1,093 million and $1,396 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively). Our most significant collaborative arrangement is with Safran Aircraft engines, a subsidiary of Safran Group of France, which sells LEAP and CFM56 engines through CFM International, a jointly owned non-consolidated company. GE makes substantial sales of parts and services to CFM International based on arms-length terms.\n\nINSURANCE REVENUES. Insurance revenues is comprised primarily of premiums and investment income related to our run-off Insurance business. For traditional long-duration insurance contracts, we report premiums as revenue when due. Premiums received on non-traditional long-duration insurance contracts and investment contracts, including annuities without significant mortality risk, are not reported as revenues but rather as deposit liabilities. We recognize revenues for charges and assessments on these contracts, mostly for mortality, contract initiation, administration and surrender. Amounts credited to policyholder accounts are charged to expense.\n\nCASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH. Debt securities and money market instruments with original maturities of three months or less are included in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash unless classified as available-for-sale investment securities. Restricted cash primarily comprised funds restricted in connection with certain ongoing litigation matters and amounted to $317 million and $408 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.\n\nINVESTMENT SECURITIES. We report investments in available-for-sale debt securities and certain equity securities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are recorded to other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes and adjustments related to our insurance liabilities. Unrealized gains and losses on equity securities with readily determinable fair values are recorded to earnings.\n\nAlthough we generally do not have the intent to sell any specific debt securities in the ordinary course of managing our portfolio, we may sell debt securities prior to their maturities for a variety of reasons, including diversification, credit quality, yield and liquidity requirements and the funding of claims and obligations to policyholders.\n\nWe regularly review investment securities for impairment. For debt securities, if we do not intend to sell the security or it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost, we evaluate qualitative criteria, such as the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer, to determine whether we do not expect to recover the amortized cost basis of the security. We also evaluate quantitative criteria including determining whether there has been an adverse change in expected future cash flows. If we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security, we consider the security to contain an expected credit loss, and we record the difference between the security's amortized cost basis and its recoverable amount in earnings as an allowance for credit loss and the difference between the security's recoverable amount and fair value in other comprehensive income. If we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the security is considered impaired, and we recognize the entire difference between the security's amortized cost basis and its fair value in earnings. See Note 3 for further information.\n\nCURRENT RECEIVABLES. Amounts due from customers arising from the sales of equipment and services are recorded at the outstanding amount, less allowance for losses. We regularly monitor the recoverability of our receivables. See Note 4 for further information.\n\nALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES. When we record customer receivables, contract assets and financing receivables arising from revenue transactions, as well as commercial mortgage loans and reinsurance recoverables in our run-off insurance operations, financial guarantees and certain commitments, we record an allowance for credit losses for the current expected credit losses (CECL) inherent in the asset over its expected life. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account deducted from the amortized cost basis of the assets to present their net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected. Each period the allowance for credit losses is adjusted through earnings to reflect expected credit losses over the remaining lives of the assets. We evaluate debt securities with unrealized losses to determine whether any of the losses arise from concerns about the issuer's credit or the underlying collateral and record an allowance for credit losses, if required.",

          "chunk_text": "REVENUE RECOGNITION ON LONG -TERM SERVICES AG REEMENTS. We enter into long-term services agreements with our customers, predominantly within the CES segment, that require us to maintain the customers' assets over the contract terms, which generally range from 5 to 25 years. Contract modifications that extend or revise contracts are not uncommon. We recognize revenue as we perform under the arrangements using the percentage of completion method which is based on our costs incurred to date relative to our estimate of total expected costs. This requires us to make estimates of customer payments expected to be received over the current contract term as well as the costs to perform required maintenance services.\n\nOur rights to consideration for these arrangements are generally based on the utilization of the asset (e.g., per hour of usage) and contractual payment terms are based on either periodic billing schedules or upon the occurrence of a maintenance event, such as an overhaul. A s a result, a significant estimate in determining expected revenue of a contract is estimating how customers will utilize their assets over the term of the agreement. The estimate of utilization, which can change over the contract life, impacts both the amount of customer payments we expect to receive and our estimate of future contract costs. Customers' asset utilization will influence the timing and extent of overhauls and other service events over the life of the contract. We generally use a combination of both historical utilization trends as well as forward-looking information such as market conditions and potential asset retirements in developing our revenue estimates.\n\nTo develop our cost estimates, we consider the timing and extent of future maintenance and overhaul events, including the frequency of maintenance events and cost of labor, spare parts and other resources required to perform the maintenance. In developing our cost estimates, we utilize a combination of our historical cost experience and expected cost improvements. Cost improvements are only included in future cost estimates after savings have been observed in actual results or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process.\n\nWe routinely review estimates and revise them to adjust for changes in outlook. Changes in estimates are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis with an adjustment to revenue in the current period. These revisions are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review. Contract modifications that change the rights and obligations, as well as the nature, timing and extent of future cash flows, are evaluated for potential price concessions, contract asset impairments and significant financing to determine if adjustments of earnings are required before effectively accounting for a modified contract as a new contract.\n\nWe regularly assess expected billings adjustments and customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract assets, including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination. We gain insight into future utilization and cost trends, as well as credit risk, through our knowledge of the installed base of equipment and fleet management strategies through close interaction with our customers that comes with supplying critical services and parts over extended periods. Revisions may affect a long-term services agreement's total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings.\n\nOn December 31, 2024, our long-term service agreements net liability balance of $6.6 billion represents approximately 4.1% of our total estimated life of contract billings of $162 billion. Our contracts (on average) are approximately 18.4% complete based on costs incurred to date and our estimate of future costs. Revisions to our estimates of future billings or costs that increase or decrease total estimated contract profitability by one percentage point would increase or decrease the long-term service agreements balance by $0.4 billion. Billings collected on these contracts were $8.6 billion and $8.1 billion during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See Notes 1 and 8 for further information.\n\nNONRECURRING ENGINEERING  COSTS. We incur contract fulfillment costs for engineering and development of products directly related to existing or anticipated contracts with customers, primarily in our Defense &amp; Propulsion Technologies segment. Contract fulfillment costs are capitalized to the extent recoverable from the customer contract, and subsequently amortized as the products are delivered to the customer. We periodically assess the recoverability of capitalized contract fulfillment costs, which requires significant judgement. Specifically, we estimate program volumes, contract revenue based on negotiated prices, and product costs based on input costs, inflation and productivity. See Note 8 for further information.\n\nIMPAIRMENT OF G OODWILL AND OTHER IDENTIFIED INTANG IBLE ASSETS . Goodwill is subject to annual, or more frequent, if necessary, impairment testing. In the impairment test, the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts, including strategic and annual operating plans, adjusted for terminal value assumptions, or a market approach, when available and appropriate, utilizing market observable pricing multiples of similar businesses and comparable transactions, or both. These impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, and changes to those assumptions could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. To address this uncertainty, we perform sensitivity analyses on key estimates and assumptions. Once the fair value is determined, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, it is impaired. In the fourth quarter of each y ear, we perform our annual impairment test. See Note 7 for further information.\n\nWe review identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Determining whether an impairment loss has occurred requires the use of our internal forecast to estimate future cash flows and the useful life over which these cash flows will occur. To determine fair value, we use our internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate discount rate. See Notes 1 and 7 for further information.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 17",

      "answer": "In 2022, GE announced the RISE Program as a collaborative technology development initiative with Safran, targeting a reduction of more than 20% in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions compared to current engines. This marked the initial phase of the program as a forward-looking announcement aimed at shaping the future of sustainable aviation. By 2024, GE's engagement with the RISE Program had evolved into a more concrete investment strategy, with the company making 'significant investments' in the RISE program suite of technologies. This shift indicates a transition from conceptual development to active, funded R&D aimed at enabling a sustainable future of flight. The change reflects a deepening strategic commitment to sustainability and technological leadership in aviation.",

          "chunk_text": "Significant Trends &amp; Developments. The global COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a material adverse effect on the global airline industry, although Aviation's results in 2021 reflect improvement in market fundamentals. A key underlying driver of Aviation's commercial engine and services business is global commercial air traffic, which in turn is driven by economic activity and consumer and business propensity to travel. Since the beginning of the pandemic in the first quarter of 2020, we have seen varied levels of recovery in global markets. Government travel restrictions, public health advisories, individuals' propensity to travel and continued cases of the virus have all impacted the level of air travel. Aviation regularly tracks global departures, which for 2021, were approximately 30% below 2019. Global departures improved during 2021, up approximately 20% compared to 2020, but levels of recovery varied across regions due in large part to the emergence of COVID-19 virus variants. Aviation remains confident in the recovery, while actively monitoring the impact of travel restrictions, quarantine requirements, and economic and industry forecasts. We are in frequent dialogue with our airline and airframe customers about the outlook for commercial air travel, new aircraft production, fleet retirements, and after-market services, including shop visit and spare parts demand. Given current trends, we expect domestic travel routes primarily served by narrowbody aircraft to recover before long-haul, international travel routes, which are primarily served by widebody aircraft. Consistent with industry projections, Aviation continues to estimate the duration of the market recovery to be prolonged over the next couple of years, dependent on containing the spread of the virus, effective inoculation programs and government collaboration to encourage travel, particularly around reducing quarantine requirements.\n\nAviation has taken several actions to respond to the current adverse environment and is actively monitoring the pace of demand recovery to ensure the business is appropriately sized for the future. In addition, we continue to partner with our airline and leasing customers and collaborate with our airframe partners on production rates for 2022 and beyond.\n\nAs it relates to the military environment, Aviation continues to forecast strong military demand creating future growth opportunities for our Military business unit as the U.S. Department of Defense and foreign governments have continued flight operations, and have allocated budgets to upgrade and modernize their existing fleets. During 2021, Aviation experienced supply chain challenges impacting the delivery of military engines, which the business is actively addressing.\n\nTotal engineering, comprising company, customer and partner-funded and nonrecurring engineering costs, decreased compared to prior year in line with the changes in the commercial environment and due to the timing of planned program expenditures. Aviation continues to be committed to investment in developing and maturing technologies that enable a more sustainable future of flight. In June 2021, Aviation and Safran announced Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (RISE), a technology development program targeting more than 20% lower fuel consumption and CO2 emissions compared to today's engines. In September 2021, Aviation's Catalyst engine, the first clean-sheet turboprop design entering the business and general aviation market in 50 years, completed its first flight.\n\nAviation is taking actions to protect its ability to serve its customers now and as the global airline industry recovers. Aviation's deep history of innovation and technology leadership, commercial engine installed base of approximately 39,400 units, with approximately 10,800 units under long-term service agreements, and military engine installed base of approximately 26,200 units represents strong long-term fundamentals. Aviation expects to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic well-positioned to drive long-term profitable growth and cash generation over time.\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, Emerson completed the creation of New AspenTech by contributing its industrial software business and $6.0 billion in cash, resulting in a 55% ownership stake. A noncontrolling interest of $5.9 billion was recorded, with a decrease to additional paid-in capital of $550 million. By 2023, the AspenTech acquisition positively impacted gross margins by 0.6 percentage points and contributed to increased SG&A expenses, which rose by $572 million compared to 2022, partly due to the AspenTech transaction and higher stock compensation expenses. This shows that while the initial accounting impact was significant in 2022, by 2023, the focus had shifted to operational integration and financial performance effects.",

(\"Heritage AspenTech\") to contribute two of Emerson's stand-alone industrial software businesses, Open Systems International, Inc. and the Geological Simulation Software business (collectively, the 'Emerson Industrial Software Business'), along with approximately $6.0 billion in cash to Heritage AspenTech stockholders, to create \"New AspenTech\", a diversified, high-performance industrial software leader with greater scale, capabilities and technologies (hereinafter referred to as \"AspenTech\"). Upon closing of the transaction, Emerson beneficially owned 55 percent of the outstanding shares of AspenTech common stock (on a fully diluted basis) and former Heritage AspenTech stockholders owned the remaining outstanding shares of AspenTech common stock. AspenTech and its subsidiaries now operate under Heritage AspenTech's previous name 'Aspen Technology, Inc.' and AspenTech common stock is traded on NASDAQ under AspenTech's previous stock ticker symbol 'AZPN.'\n\nThe business combination has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting with Emerson considered the accounting acquirer of Heritage AspenTech. The net assets of Heritage AspenTech were recorded at their estimated fair value and the Emerson Industrial Software Business continues at its historical basis. The Company recorded a noncontrolling interest of $5.9 billion for the 45 percent ownership interest of former Heritage AspenTech stockholders in AspenTech. The noncontrolling interest associated with the Heritage AspenTech acquired net assets was recorded at fair value determined using the closing market price per share of Heritage AspenTech as of May 16, 2022, while the portion attributable to the Emerson Industrial Software business was recorded at its historical carrying amount. The impact of recognizing the noncontrolling interest in the Emerson Industrial Software Business resulted in a decrease to additional paid-in-capital of $550.\n\nThe following table summarizes the components of the purchase consideration reflected in the acquisition accounting using Heritage AspenTech's shares outstanding and closing market price per share as of May 16, 2022 (in millions except share and per share data):\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, AspenTech was in the process of being acquired by Emerson, and its financial impact was only partially reflected in Emerson\u2019s results due to the timing of the transaction. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2022 included a $0.12 benefit related to the AspenTech acquisition. By 2023, the transaction had closed, and Emerson owned 55% of AspenTech on a fully diluted basis. Additionally, AspenTech\u2019s financials began to more directly influence Emerson\u2019s results, as seen in the 0.6 percentage point margin improvement in gross profit and higher SG&A expenses, which included $125 in stock compensation related to AspenTech stock plans. This marks a clear evolution from a pre-acquisition relationship in 2022 to a consolidated operational and financial integration in 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, AspenTech was a pending acquisition with partial financial impact noted in Emerson's earnings, including a $0.12 benefit to adjusted EPS.",
        "Step 2: By 2023, the acquisition was completed, with Emerson owning 55% of AspenTech, and AspenTech\u2019s financials were integrated into Emerson\u2019s results, including SG&A expenses tied to AspenTech stock plans and margin improvements from the acquisition.",
        "Step 3: The relationship evolved from a pre-closing acquisition phase in 2022 to a post-closing integration phase in 2023, with AspenTech becoming a consolidated subsidiary influencing Emerson\u2019s financial metrics."

Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $5.25 compared with $4.51 in the prior year, reflecting strong operating results and a $0.12 benefit related to the AspenTech acquisition.\n\nThe Company generated operating cash flow of $2.9 billion in 2022, a decrease of $653, or 18 percent, reflecting higher working capital due to increased sales and continued supply chain constraints.\n\nThe table below presents the Company's diluted earnings per share on an adjusted basis to facilitate period-to-period comparisons and provide additional insight into the underlying, ongoing operating performance of the Company.

      "answer": "In 2022, Emerson reported a balance of $8,326 million related to AspenTech as part of its acquisitions, indicating a significant financial stake following the acquisition of Heritage AspenTech. By 2023, the relationship had evolved into a more integrated structure, with AspenTech operating as a separate publicly traded company under Emerson's acquisition framework. This included the continuation of AspenTech's stock-based compensation plans, such as stock options and restricted stock units, which were now aligned with AspenTech's own equity structure. Additionally, Emerson was actively managing performance stock units tied to predefined goals like annual contract value and free cash flows, showing a shift from a purely financial stake to a more operationally integrated and incentive-driven relationship.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Emerson had a financial stake in AspenTech valued at $8,326 million, as disclosed in the balance sheet under acquisitions.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, AspenTech operated as a separate publicly traded company post-acquisition, with Emerson continuing to influence its governance through stock-based compensation plans and performance-linked equity incentives.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a transformation from a financial investment to a more strategic, operationally integrated structure with performance-linked incentives."
