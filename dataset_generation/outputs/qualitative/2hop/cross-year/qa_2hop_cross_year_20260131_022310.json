      "question": "How did GILD's strategic relationship with Arcus evolve between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of equity ownership and governance influence?",
      "answer": "In 2023, GILD owned approximately 19.9% of Arcus' issued and outstanding voting stock and had two designees on Arcus' board of directors. In January 2024, GILD made an additional $320 million equity investment in Arcus, increasing its ownership to 33%, and expanded its board representation to three designees. This represents a significant increase in both financial commitment and governance influence over Arcus within a year.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 - In 2023, GILD owned 19.9% of Arcus with two board designees.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 - In 2024, GILD increased ownership to 33% after a $320M investment and had three board designees.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - GILD's relationship with Arcus evolved from a minority stake with limited governance to a significant controlling interest with expanded board representation."

          "chunk_text": "Regulators globally are also imposing data privacy and security requirements, such as EU's G eneral Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR') and other domestic data privacy and security laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act and the California Privacy Rights Act. These and other similar types of laws and regulations that have been or may be passed, often include requirements with respect to personal information, and non-compliance with such laws may result in liability through private actions (subject to statutorily defined damages in the event of certain data breaches) and government enforcement. Other changes or new laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of personal information, could greatly increase our cost of providing our products and services or even prevent us from offering certain services in jurisdictions in which we operate.\n\n## Strategic and Financial Risks\n\n## We are subject to risks associated with engaging in business acquisitions, licensing arrangements, collaborations, options, equity investments, asset divestitures and other strategic transactions.\n\nWe have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, such transactions as part of our business strategy. We may not identify suitable transactions in the future and, if we do, we may not complete such transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, including the possibility that a governmental entity or regulatory body may delay or refuse to grant approval for the consummation of the transaction. If we are successful in making an acquisition or closing a licensing arrangement or collaboration, the products, intellectual property and technologies that are acquired or licensed may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than anticipated. As required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, we conduct annual impairment testing of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the assets are impaired. We have in the past and may in the future need to recognize impairment charges related to the products, intellectual property and technologies that are acquired or licensed as a result of such testing. For example, we recorded partial impairment charges during the three months ended March 31, 2024 in connection with our Phase 3 EVOKE-01 study evaluating sacituzumab govitecan-hziy and during the three months ended September 30, 2024 following the strategic decision to discontinue our clinical development program in metastatic NSCLC for Trodelvy in the second-line indication (for more information, see Note 9. Goodwill and Intangible Assets of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). We also continue to monitor the progression of our in-process research and development assets related to sacituzumab govitecan-hziy for non-small cell lung cancer and bulevirtide for chronic hepatitis D virus for treatment primarily in the U.S. and may need to evaluate these items for impairment prior to the fourth quarter if there are any events or circumstances in our ongoing development activities indicating it is more like than not that these assets might be impaired. For option structured deals, there is no assurance that we will elect to exercise our option right, and it is possible that disagreements, uncertainties or other circumstances may arise, including with respect to whether our option rights have been appropriately triggered, which may hinder our ability to realize the expected benefits. For equity investments in our strategic partners, such as in connection with our collaborations with Arcus, G alapagos NV  and Arcellx, Inc., the value of our equity investments may fluctuate and decline in value.  If  we  are  not  successful  in  the  ex ecution  or  implementation  of  these  transactions,  our  financial  condition,  cash  flows  and  results  of  operations  may  be adversely affected, and our stock price could decline.\n\nWe have paid substantial amounts of cash and incurred additional debt to finance our strategic transactions. Additional indebtedness and a lower cash balance could result in a downgrade of our credit ratings, limit our ability to borrow additional funds or refinance ex isting debt on favorable terms, increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions, and reduce our financial flexibility to continue with our capital investments, stock repurchases and dividend payments. We may be adversely impacted by any failure to overcome these additional risks.\n\n## Changes in our effective income tax rate could reduce our earnings.\n\nWe  are  subject  to  income  tax es  in  the  U.S.  and  various  foreign  jurisdictions.  Due  to  economic  and  political  conditions,  various  countries  are  actively considering and have made changes to existing tax laws, and we cannot predict the form or timing of such changes. Our effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices and interpretations, including in the U.S., G ermany and Ireland.\n\nWe are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and tax authorities in various foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax  laws and regulations and, as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax  authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We may be adversely affected by the resolution of one or more of these exposures in any reporting period.",

      "question": "How has the commercial significance of Biktarvy evolved for GILD from 2023 to 2024, and what implications does this have for the company's HIV business strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Biktarvy was a major revenue driver for GILD, generating $11,850 million in total product sales globally, representing a growth from $10,390 million in 2022. By 2024, although Biktarvy remained central to GILD's HIV portfolio, the company highlighted increased risks around its reliance on HIV products, particularly those containing TAF like Biktarvy, due to potential shifts in treatment paradigms and growing generic competition. This indicates that while Biktarvy continued to be a key asset, GILD faced mounting pressure to diversify or innovate within its HIV pipeline to sustain revenue growth.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, Biktarvy generated $11,850 million in total global sales, making it GILD\u2019s top-selling HIV product.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, GILD emphasized heightened risk around its dependence on HIV products, including Biktarvy, due to potential changes in treatment paradigms and generic competition.",
        "Step 3: The shift from a strong revenue performance in 2023 to a risk-focused narrative in 2024 indicates a strategic evolution in how GILD views Biktarvy\u2019s role in its HIV portfolio."

RISK FACTORS\n\nIn evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the following discussion of material risks, events and uncertainties that make an investment in us speculative or risky in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A manifestation of any of the following risks and uncertainties could,  in  circumstances  we  may  or  may  not  be  able  to  accurately  predict,  materially  and  adversely  affect  our  business  and  operations,  growth,  reputation (including the commercial or scientific reputation of our products), prospects, product pipeline and sales, operating and financial results, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and stock price. W e note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors; our operations could also be affected by factors, events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. Therefore, you should not consider the following risks to be a complete statement of all the potential risks or uncertainties that we face. Moreover, some of the factors, events and contingencies discussed below may have occurred in the past, but the disclosures below are not representations as to whether or not the factors, events or contingencies have occurred in the past, and instead reflect our beliefs and opinions as to the factors, events or contingencies that could materially and adversely affect us in the future.\n\n## Product and Commercialization Risks\n\n## Certain of our products subject us to additional or heightened risks.\n\n## HIV\n\nWe receive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales of our products for the treatment and prevention of HIV  infection. We may be unable to sustain or increase sales of our HIV  products for any number of reasons, including market share gains by competitive products, including generics, or the inability to introduce new HIV medications necessary to remain competitive. In such case, we may need to scale back our operations, including our future drug development and spending on research and development ('R&amp;D') efforts. For example, many of our HIV  products contain tenofovir alafenamide ('TAF'), which belongs to the nucleoside class of antiviral therapeutics. If there are any changes to the treatment or prevention paradigm for HIV , and nucleoside-based therapeutics do not remain the preferred regimen, our HIV product sales would be adversely impacted.\n\n## Cell Therapy\n\nAdvancing a novel and personalized therapy such as Y escarta or Tecartus, which are chimeric antigen receptor ('CAR') T-cell therapies, creates significant challenges, including:\n\n- educating and certifying medical personnel regarding the procedures and the potential side effects, such as cytokine release syndrome and neurologic toxicities, in compliance with the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ('FDA');\n- securing sufficient supply of other medications to manage side effects, such as tocilizumab and corticosteroids, which may not be available in sufficient quantities, may not adequately control the side effects and/or may have detrimental impacts on the efficacy of cell therapy;\n- developing and maintaining a robust and reliable process for engineering a patient's T cells in our facilities and infusing them back into the patient; and\n- conditioning patients with chemotherapy in advance of administering our therapy, which may increase the risk of adverse side effects.\n\nThe use of engineered T cells as a potential cancer treatment is a recent development and may not be broadly accepted by physicians, patients, hospitals, cancer treatment centers, payers and others in the medical community. For example, in January 2024, FDA instituted a class labeling change for all approved CAR Tcell therapies, including a 'boxed warning' about the possible risk of secondary T-cell malignancies in patients treated with CAR T-cell therapy. For challenges related to the reimbursement of Y escarta and Tecartus, see also ' Our existing products are subject to reimbursement pressures from government agencies and other third parties, required rebates and discounts, and other pricing pressures.'\n\nWe rely on third-party sites to collect patients' white blood cells, known as apheresis centers, as well as shippers, couriers, and hospitals for the logistical collection of patients' white blood cells and ultimate delivery of Y escarta and Tecartus to patients. These vendors may encounter disruptions or difficulties that could result in product loss and regulatory action. Apheresis centers may also choose not to participate in our quality certification process, or we may be unable to complete such certification in a timely manner or at all, which could delay or constrain our manufacturing and commercialization efforts.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Trodelvy was indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer, and urothelial cancer. By 2024, the FDA granted Trodelvy a Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer in patients whose disease has progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy. This indicates a strategic expansion of Trodelvy\u2019s development into new oncology indications with high unmet medical need.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, Trodelvy had specific indications in breast and urothelial cancers, reflecting its established role in those therapeutic areas.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, Trodelvy received a Breakthrough Therapy designation for small cell lung cancer, signaling a new focus area and accelerated regulatory support.",
        "Step 3: The addition of a Breakthrough Therapy designation in 2024 demonstrates a meaningful evolution in Trodelvy\u2019s regulatory and development strategy, expanding beyond its initial indications."

By 2024, the regulatory landscape for Trodelvy advanced significantly with the FDA granting it a second Breakthrough Therapy designation, specifically for the treatment of adult patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer who have progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy. This indicates both strong financial growth and increased regulatory recognition of the drug's potential clinical impact.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Trodelvy generated $370 million in U.S. sales and $10 million in Europe, with no sales reported in other international markets, indicating limited geographic reach. By 2023, Trodelvy received significant regulatory approvals: it was approved by the FDA for treating adult patients with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer, and it obtained EC approval for monotherapy treatment of unresectable or metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer.

      "answer": "In 2022, Trodelvy was part of Gilead's marketed product portfolio and contributed to growth in the oncology franchise, though no specific regulatory updates were mentioned. By 2023, Trodelvy received both FDA and EC approvals for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer who had received prior endocrine-based therapy and at least two additional systemic therapies. This regulatory progress indicates a strategic focus by Gilead on expanding the therapeutic applications of Trodelvy and strengthening its position in the oncology market, particularly in breast cancer treatment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Trodelvy was listed as part of Gilead\u2019s marketed products and noted to be experiencing growth within the oncology franchise, but no new regulatory approvals were mentioned.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, Trodelvy received specific regulatory approvals from both the FDA and the European Commission for a defined indication in HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer.",
        "Step 3: The progression from being a marketed product with unspecified indications in 2022 to having clearly defined regulatory approvals in 2023 shows a strategic evolution in Gilead\u2019s oncology development and commercialization approach."

      "answer": "In 2022, Gilead highlighted the October 2020 loss of exclusivity of Truvada in the United States as a transitory headwind, indicating that the product was no longer protected under patent, which likely affected revenue. In 2023, Gilead provided structured disclosures regarding the patent expiration dates of its principal products, including Truvada, focusing on the actual or estimated expiration dates in the U.S. and the EU. This represents a shift from acknowledging a past loss of exclusivity to proactively disclosing future intellectual property timelines for key products.",

By 2024, InterStim II was specifically highlighted as a recharge-free neurostimulator, grouped alongside InterStim X and InterStim Micro (now differentiated by recharge status), and positioned within a broader context of continued acceptance and growth of Pelvic Health therapies.

The U.S. FDA lifted its distribution  requirements  on  our  implantable  drug  pump  in October 2017 and its warning letter in November 2017.\n- Our ability  to  successfully  develop,  obtain  regulatory  approval  of  and  commercialize  the  products  within  our  pipeline,  which include, but are not limited to, our closed-loop Percept PC and RC devices with adaptive DBS (aDBS), our hemorrhagic stroke intravascular device, and our next-generation spine enabling technologies.\n\n## Diabetes\n\nDiabetes' products include insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems, consumables, and smart insulin pen systems. Diabetes' sales for fiscal year 2022 were $2.3 billion, a decrease of 3 percent as compared to fiscal year 2021. Currency had an unfavorable impact on net sales for fiscal year 2022 of $2 million. Diabetes' net sales decline for fiscal year 2022 was primarily attributable to declines in the U.S. partially offset by growth in the MiniMed 780G insulin pump system and integrated CGM in the international markets.\n\nIn addition to the macro-economic and geopolitical factors described in the Executive Level Overview, looking ahead we expect Diabetes could be affected by the following:\n\n- Patient  demand  for  the  MiniMed  770G  insulin  pump  system,  which  launched  in  the  U.S.  in  November  2020  and  in  Japan  in January 2022. The system is powered by SmartGuard technology and features the added benefits of smartphone connectivity and an expanded age indication to children as young as age two.\n- Continued growth internationally for the MiniMed 780G insulin pump system. The MiniMed 780G system was approved in the E.U.  in  June  2020  and  has  launched  in  over  40  countries  on  four  continents  outside  the  U.S.  The  global  adoption  of  sensoraugmented insulin pump systems has resulted in strong sensor attachment rates.\n- Continued  acceptance  and  growth  of  the  Guardian  Connect  CGM  system  which  displays  glucose  information  directly  to  a smartphone to help ensure patients have access to their glucose levels seamlessly and discretely. The Guardian Connect CGM system is available on both Apple iOS and Android devices.\n- Strengthening  our  position  in  the  diabetes  market  as  a  result  of  the  September  2020  acquisition  of  Companion  Medical. Companion Medical offered a U.S. FDA cleared InPen smart pen system that combines the freedom of a reusable Bluetooth pen with the intelligence of an intuitive mobile application that helps users administer the appropriate insulin dose. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, we integrated our CGM data into the InPen application, which allows users to have their Medtronic CGM readings in real-time alongside insulin dose information, all in one view.\n- Continued pump and CGM competition in an expanding global market.\n- Changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs, along with additional payor coverage on insulin pumps.",

      "question": "How did the revenue performance of Inlyta evolve between 2022 and 2023, and what factors contributed to the change in its growth trajectory?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Inlyta contributed to Pfizer's operational growth, specifically mentioned among products like Comirnaty, Eliquis, and Vyndaqel that drove growth in the U.S. and international markets. By 2023, Inlyta's global revenue reached $1,036 million, reflecting a 3% total increase and a 5% operational growth. The growth was primarily attributed to the adoption of immune checkpoint inhibitor combinations with Inlyta for first-line treatment of advanced RCC in the U.S., despite lower volumes and net price in certain European markets. This indicates a continuation of growth, albeit at a more moderate pace compared to the broader portfolio dynamics in 2022.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 (2022) - Inlyta was explicitly listed among key products contributing to operational growth, indicating a positive revenue impact.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 (2023) - Inlyta generated $1,036 million in global revenue, with a 3% total increase and 5% operational growth, driven by U.S. adoption in advanced RCC treatment.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - Inlyta maintained a growth trend from 2022 to 2023, but the magnitude of its contribution appears more modest in 2023, with specific market dynamics (U.S. adoption vs. European declines) shaping its performance."

      "answer": "In 2022, Inlyta had total global revenue of $1,003 million, while in 2023, its revenue increased to $1,036 million, representing a 3% growth. This growth was primarily driven by continued adoption of Inlyta in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors for the first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in the U.S., and growth in emerging markets. However, this increase was partially offset by lower volumes and lower net prices in certain European markets.",

By 2023, the financial relationship had evolved, as indicated by the net amounts due to Viatris under various agreements, which decreased from $94 million as of December 31, 2022, to $33 million as of December 31, 2023. Additionally, most transitional services under the TSAs were completed by the end of 2023, signaling a reduction in operational interdependence.",

The interim agency operating model arrangements primarily include billings, collections and remittance of rebates that we are performing on a transitional basis on behalf of Viatris. Under the MSAs, Pfizer or Viatris, as the case may be, manufactures, labels and packages products for the other party. The terms of the MSAs range in initial duration from four to seven years post-Separation. The TSAs primarily involve Pfizer providing services to Viatris related to finance, information technology and human resource infrastructure and are generally expected to be for terms of no more than three years post-Separation. The amounts recorded under the above agreements were not material to our consolidated results of operations in 2021 and 2020. In addition, Pfizer and Mylan had a pre-existing arms-length commercial agreement, which is continuing with Viatris and is not material to Pfizer's consolidated financial statements.\n\nNet amounts due from Viatris under the above agreements were $53 million as of December 31, 2021 and $401 million as of December 31, 2020. The cash flows associated with the above agreements are included in Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations, except for a $277 million payment to Viatris made in 2021 pursuant to terms of the separation agreement, which is reported in Other financing activities, net, and was recorded as a payable to Viatris in Other current liabilities as of December 31, 2020.\n\n## Components of Discontinued operations--net of tax:\n\n",

On November 16, 2020, we completed the spin-off and the combination of our Upjohn Business with Mylan to form Viatris. On December 21, 2020, Pfizer and Viatris completed the termination of the Mylan-Japan collaboration. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, the financial results of Meridian are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, the financial results of the Upjohn Business and Mylan-Japan collaboration were reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Prior-period financial information has been restated, as appropriate. See Note 1A . (a)\n\nAt the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, we reorganized our commercial operations and began to manage our commercial operations through a new global structure consisting of two operating segments, each led by a single manager: Biopharma, our innovative science-based biopharmaceutical business and PC1. PC1, which previously had been managed within the Hospital therapeutic area, includes revenues from our contract manufacturing, including certain Comirnaty-related manufacturing activities performed on behalf of BioNTech ($320 million for 2021 and $0 million for 2020 and 2019), and active pharmaceutical ingredient sales operation, as well as revenues related to our manufacturing and supply agreements with former legacy Pfizer businesses/partnerships, including but not limited to, transitional manufacturing and supply agreements with Viatris following the spin-off of the Upjohn Business. We have revised prior period information to conform to the current management structure. (b)\n\n- Prevnar family include revenues from Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 (pediatric and adult) and Prevnar 20 (adult). (c)\n- Biosimilars are highly similar versions of approved and authorized biological medicines and primarily include revenues from Inflectra/Remsima, Ruxience, Retacrit, Zirabev and Trazimera. (d)\n- Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) products include the revenues from Panzyga, Octagam and Cutaquig. (e)\n- On July 31, 2019, our Consumer Healthcare business, an OTC medicines business, was combined with GSK's consumer healthcare business to form a new consumer healthcare JV. See Note 2C . (f)\n- Total Sterile Injectable Pharmaceuticals represents the total of all branded and generic injectable products in the Hospital therapeutic area, including anti-infective sterile injectable pharmaceuticals. (g)\n\n## Remaining Performance Obligations\n\nContracted revenue expected to be recognized from remaining performance obligations for firm orders in long-term contracts to supply Comirnaty to our customers totals $34.4 billion as of December 31, 2021, which includes amounts received in advance and deferred and amounts that will be invoiced as we deliver the product to our customers in future periods.

      "answer": "In 2023, Amgen changed the accounting method for its investment in BeiGene from the equity method to fair value, resulting in gains recognized in connection with this revaluation. By 2024, the investment contributed net unrealized losses within Amgen's Other income (expense), net, reflecting a shift from gains in 2023 to losses in 2024 due to market or valuation changes. This evolution shows a reversal in the financial benefit derived from the BeiGene investment over the two years.",

Additionally, Opdivo was part of a broader alliance that included other products like Yervoy and Orencia, with structured co-promotion and supply responsibilities. By 2024, Opdivo's role had evolved significantly, marked by a new FDA approval in March 2024 for use in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine for the first-line treatment of unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. This reflects a shift from a co-development focus to a more independent product introduction strategy, with BMY taking the lead in expanding Opdivo\u2019s therapeutic applications in key oncology markets.",

          "chunk_text": "## Manufacturing and Quality Assurance\n\nWe operate and manage a manufacturing network, consisting of internal and external resources, in a manner that permits us to improve efficiency while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity. Pharmaceutical manufacturing processes are complex, highly regulated and vary widely from product to product. Given that shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a lengthy  process  requiring  significant  capital  and  other  expenditures  as  well  as  regulatory  approvals,  we  manage  and  operate  a flexible manufacturing network that minimizes unnecessary product transfers and inefficient uses of manufacturing capacity. For further discussion of the regulatory impact on our manufacturing, refer to '-Government Regulation' above.\n\nOur significant biologics, cell therapy and pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities are located in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Ireland and Switzerland and require significant ongoing capital investment for both maintenance and compliance with increasing regulatory requirements.  For  example,  the  FDA  approved  our  large  scale  multi-product  bulk  biologics  manufacturing  facility  in  Devens, Massachusetts  in  May  2012  and  we  continue  to  make  capital  investments  in  this  facility.  In  addition,  we  expect  to  continue modification  of  our  existing  manufacturing  network  to  meet  complex  processing  standards  that  are  required  for  our  growing portfolio,  particularly  biologics  and  cell  therapy.  Biologics  manufacturing  involves  more  complex  processes  than  those  of traditional  pharmaceutical  operations.  For  example,  we  completed  our  new  large-scale  biologics  manufacturing  facility  in Cruiserath,  Ireland,  which  was  approved  by  the  FDA  in  December  2019  and  by  the  EU  in  January  2020.  For  our  cell  therapy product candidates and marketed products, including Breyanzi and Abecma , we have invested in our own manufacturing network, including facilities in Bothell, Washington; Summit, New Jersey; and Devens, Massachusetts, as well as third-party manufacturers. Beyond  regulatory  requirements,  many  of  our  products  involve  technically  sophisticated  manufacturing  processes  or  require specialized raw materials. For example, we manufacture for clinical and commercial use several sterile products, biologic products and CAR T products, all of which are particularly complex and involve highly specialized manufacturing technologies. As a result, even slight deviations at any point in their production process may lead to production failures or recalls.\n\nIn addition to our own manufacturing sites, we rely on third parties to manufacture or supply us with all or a portion of the active product ingredient or drug substance necessary for us to manufacture various products, such as Opdivo , Eliquis, Sprycel , Yervoy, Reblozyl, Inrebic, Abraxane, and Pomalyst/Imnovid. We are also expanding our use of third-party manufacturers for drug product and finished goods manufacturing and we continue to shift towards using third-party manufacturers for supply of our mature and other brands . With respect to Revlimid and Thalomid \u00ae, we own and operate a manufacturing facility in Zofingen, Switzerland, in which we produce the active product ingredient for Revlimid and Thalomid and  we  contract  with  a  third-party  manufacturer  to provide the back-up active product ingredient for Revlimid and Thalomid . To maintain a stable supply of these products, we take a variety of actions including inventory management and maintenance of additional quantities of materials, when possible, that are designed  to  provide  for  a  reasonable  level  of  these  ingredients  to  be  held  by  the  third-party  supplier,  us  or  both,  so  that  our manufacturing operations are not interrupted. Certain supply arrangements extend over multiple years with committed amounts using expected near or long-term demand requirements that are subject to change. As an additional protection, in some cases, we take  steps  to  maintain  an  approved  back-up  source  where  available  and  when  needed.  For  example,  we  have  the  capability  to manufacture Opdivo internally and have arrangements with third-party manufacturers to meet demand.\n\nIn connection with acquisitions, divestitures, licensing and collaboration arrangements or distribution agreements for certain of our products, or in certain other circumstances, we have entered into agreements under which we have agreed to supply our products to third parties and intend to continue to enter into such arrangements or agreements in the future. In addition to liabilities that could arise from our failure to supply such products under the agreements, these arrangements or agreements could require us to invest in facilities  for  the  manufacturing  of  non-strategic  products,  in  the  case  of  a  divestiture  or  distribution  arrangement,  resulting  in additional regulatory filings and obligations or causing an interruption in the manufacturing of our own strategic products.\n\nOur success depends in great measure upon customer confidence in the quality of our products and in the integrity of the data that support  their  safety  and  effectiveness.  Product  quality  arises  from  a  total  commitment  to  quality  in  all  parts  of  our  operations, including research and development, purchasing, facilities maintenance and planning, manufacturing, warehousing, logistics and distribution. We maintain records to demonstrate the quality and integrity of data, technical information and production processes.\n\nControl  of  production  processes  involves  established  specifications  and  standards  for  raw  materials,  components,  ingredients, equipment and facilities,  manufacturing methods and operations, packaging materials and labeling. We perform tests at various stages of production processes, on the raw materials, drug substance and the final product and on product samples held on stability to  ensure  that  the  product  meets  regulatory  requirements  and  conforms to our standards. These tests may involve chemical and physical analyses, microbiological testing or a combination of these along with other analyses. Quality control testing is provided by  business  unit/site  and  third-party  laboratories.  Quality  assurance  groups  routinely  monitor  manufacturing  procedures  and systems used by us, our subsidiaries and third-party suppliers to ensure quality and compliance requirements are met.",

          "chunk_text": "## Walk-In Medical Clinics\n\nFor services provided by the Company's walk-in medical clinics, revenue recognition occurs for completed services provided to patients, with adjustments taken for third party payor contractual obligations and patient direct bill historical collection rates.\n\n## Primary Care Capitated Revenue\n\nCapitated revenue related to the Company's primary care operations consists primarily of capitated fees for medical services it provides under capitated or capitation arrangements directly made with various Medicare Advantage managed care payors or CMS. Under the risk contracts, the Company receives from the third-party payor a fix ed payment per patient per month for a defined patient population, and the Company is then responsible for providing, managing and paying for healthcare services for that patient population, including those not provided by the Company. The Company recognizes revenue using the gross method as the Company is the principal in arranging, providing and controlling the managed healthcare services provided to the defined patient population. The Company considers all contracts with customers (enrolled patients) as a single performance obligation to stand ready to provide healthcare services. This performance obligation is satisfied over time as the Company stands ready to fulfill its obligation to enrolled patients.\n\n## In-Home Health Evaluations ('IHEs')\n\nRevenue generated from IHEs relates to the assessments performed either within the patient's home, virtually or at a healthcare provider facility as well as certain inhome clinical evaluations performed by the Company's mobile network of providers. Revenue is recognized when the IHEs are submitted to customers on a daily basis. Submission to the customer occurs after the IHEs are completed and coded, a process which may take one to several days after completion of the evaluation. The pricing for the IHEs is generally based on a fix ed transaction fee, which is directly linked to the usage of the service by the customer during a distinct service period. Customers are invoiced for evaluations performed each month and remit payment accordingly. Each IHE represents a single performance obligation for which revenue is recognized at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer upon submission of the completed and coded evaluation.\n\n## Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness Segment\n\n## Retail Pharmacy\n\nThe Company's retail drugstores recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise. For pharmacy sales, each prescription claim is its own arrangement with the customer and is a performance obligation, separate and distinct from other prescription claims under other retail network arrangements. Revenues are adjusted for refunds owed to third party payers resulting from pricing guarantees and performance against defined value-based service and performance metrics. The inputs to these estimates are not subject to a high degree of subjectivity or volatility. The effect of adjustments between estimated and actual pricing and performance refund amounts has not been material to the Company's operating results or financial condition.\n\nRevenue from Company gift cards purchased by customers is deferred as a contract liability until goods or services are transferred. Any amounts not expected to be redeemed by customers (i.e., breakage) are recognized based on historical redemption patterns.\n\nCustomer returns are not material to the Company's operating results or financial condition. Sales taxes are not included in revenues.\n\n## Loyalty and Other Programs\n\nThe Company's customer loyalty program, ExtraCare , consists of two components, ExtraSavings and ExtraBucks Rewards. ExtraSavings are coupons that are recorded as a reduction of revenue when redeemed as the Company concluded that they do not represent a promise to the customer to deliver additional goods or services at the time of issuance because they are not tied to a specific transaction or spending level. \u00ae TM \u00ae\n\nExtraBucks Rewards are accumulated by customers based on their historical spending levels. Thus, the Company has determined that there is an additional performance obligation to those customers at the time of the initial transaction. The Company allocates the transaction price to the initial transaction and the ExtraBucks Rewards transaction based upon the relative standalone selling price, which considers historical redemption patterns for the rewards. Revenue allocated to ExtraBucks Rewards is recognized as those rewards are redeemed. At the end of each period, unredeemed ExtraBucks Rewards are reflected as a contract liability.\n\nThe Company also offers a subscription-based membership program, ExtraCare Plus , under which members are entitled to a suite of benefits delivered over the course of the subscription period, as well as a promotional reward that can be redeemed for TM",

However, other senior notes due in 2030, such as the 3.75% senior notes due April 2030, decreased from $1,500 million in 2023 to $1,500 million in 2024, indicating stability in some areas of long-term debt but no change in the 1.75% notes specifically.",

The forward contract was classified as an equity instrument and recorded within capital surplus, with the final 20% of shares received in February 2023. In 2024, CVS entered into a larger $3.0 billion ASR with Morgan Stanley, accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction of $2.6 billion and a forward contract of $0.4 billion. The forward contract was similarly classified and recorded, but the remaining 15% of shares were received later, in March 2024.

      "question": "How did Pfizer's financial relationship with Paxlovid evolve between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of revenue recognition and contractual obligations?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Paxlovid generated $1.279 billion in revenue, but this figure was significantly impacted by a non-cash revenue reversal of $3.5 billion due to the expected return of 6.5 million treatment courses of EUA-labeled U.S. government inventory. By 2024, this reversal was adjusted favorably by $771 million as only 5.1 million treatment courses were actually returned, and an additional $442 million in revenue was recorded in connection with the creation of the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile (SNS). Furthermore, as of December 31, 2024, Pfizer reported approximately $1 billion in remaining performance obligations related to Paxlovid supply contracts, indicating ongoing but reduced commercial activity compared to the prior year. This evolution reflects a shift from a high-volume, government-driven revenue model in 2023 to a more stable, contracted future delivery model in 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2023, Paxlovid revenue was $1.279 billion but was significantly affected by a $3.5 billion non-cash revenue reversal due to expected returns of U.S. government inventory.",
        "In 2024, the revenue reversal was adjusted downward by $771 million based on actual returns (5.1 million treatment courses instead of the initially estimated 6.5 million), and $442 million in new revenue was recognized related to the U.S. SNS.",
        "The change reflects a shift from a volatile, event-driven revenue recognition in 2023 to a more structured contractual delivery model in 2024, with $1 billion in remaining performance obligations for Paxlovid as of year-end 2024."

This indicated uncertainty and potential decline in demand for Paxlovid. By 2024, however, remaining performance obligations for Paxlovid totaled approximately $1 billion as of December 31, 2024, signaling a stabilization and expectation of future revenue from existing contracts. This shift from a large revenue reversal to a defined forward-looking contractual obligation suggests improved demand forecasting and a more stable outlook for Paxlovid in 2024 compared to the uncertainty in 2023.",

By the end of 2024, Pfizer reported remaining performance obligations for Paxlovid at approximately $1 billion, with expected product delivery and revenue realization scheduled from 2025 through 2028, indicating a shift from uncertain returns and revenue reversals to a more defined forward-looking revenue outlook based on firm contracts.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, Pfizer recorded a significant non-cash revenue reversal of $3.5 billion related to Paxlovid due to anticipated returns of U.S. government inventory.",
        "Step 2: By 2024, Pfizer disclosed remaining performance obligations for Paxlovid totaling $1 billion, with delivery timelines extending from 2025 to 2028, signaling a stabilization and forward-looking contractual commitment.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a transformation from a liability and uncertainty in 2023 to a more structured and predictable revenue stream in 2024, indicating a strategic and financial evolution in Paxlovid's market positioning."

      "answer": "In 2023, Pfizer recorded a non-cash revenue reversal of $3.5 billion related to the expected return of 6.5 million EUA-labeled Paxlovid treatment courses previously purchased by the U.S. government. In 2024, this estimate was adjusted based on the actual return of 5.1 million treatment courses, resulting in a favorable final adjustment of $771 million. Additionally, in 2024, Pfizer recognized $442 million of revenue in connection with the creation of the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) of 1.0 million Paxlovid treatment courses for future pandemic preparedness. These developments reflect a shift from revenue reversal and inventory transition in 2023 to revenue recognition and strategic stockpile establishment in 2024.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Amgen reported a carrying value of $1,000 million for the 3.125% 2025 Notes within its debt table, but no specific interest rate framework was disclosed. By 2023, Amgen included the 3.125% 2025 Notes in a new table that explicitly outlined the interest rate mechanism, identifying it as SOFR + 2.1%. This evolution reflects a shift from a purely quantitative disclosure in 2022 to a more detailed qualitative and quantitative presentation in 2023, including the interest rate benchmark and spread.",

        "In 2022, the 3.125% 2025 Notes were listed in the debt table with a carrying value of $1,000 million, but no interest rate details were provided.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Amgen recovered $199 million in R&D costs from BeiGene, recorded product sales of $64 million, and recognized $53 million in profit and loss sharing expenses. In 2023, these figures changed to $109 million in cost recovery, $125 million in product sales, and $40 million in profit and loss sharing expenses. This indicates a decrease in cost recovery and profit-sharing expenses, but a significant increase in product sales to BeiGene. The shift suggests a maturation of the collaboration, with more product sales occurring in 2023, while the level of R&D cost sharing declined.",

For the year ended December 31, 2019, realized gains on interest-bearing securities were $92 million and realized losses were not material. Realized gains and losses on interest-bearing securities are recorded in Other income, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method.\n\nThe primary objective of our investment portfolio is to maintain safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with investment-grade credit ratings, and it places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer.\n\n## Equity securities\n\nWe held investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values of $611 million and $477 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which are included in Other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the years ended December  31,  2021,  2020  and  2019,  net  unrealized  gains  on  publicly  traded  securities  were  $161  million,  $174  million  and $112 million, respectively. Realized gains and losses on publicly traded securities for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, were not material.\n\nWe  held  investments  of  $262  million  and  $203  million  in  equity  securities  without  readily  determinable  fair  values  as  of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which are included in Other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the year  ended  December  31,  2021,  gains  due  to  upward  adjustments  on  these  securities  were  $152  million,  and  gains  realized  on  the dispositions of these securities were $41 million; for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, gains due to upward adjustments and gains realized upon dispositions of these securities were not material. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, downward  adjustments  to  the  carrying  values  of  these  securities  were  not  material.  Adjustments  were  based  on  observable  price transactions.\n\n## Equity Method Investments\n\n## BeiGene, Ltd.\n\nOn January 2, 2020, we acquired a 20.5% ownership interest in BeiGene for $2.8 billion, of which $2.6 billion was attributed to the fair value of equity securities upon closing, with the remainder attributed to prepaid R&amp;D. Our equity investment in BeiGene is included  in  Other  noncurrent  assets  in  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  Our  equity  investment  is  accounted  for  under  the  equity method of accounting due to our ability to exert significant influence over BeiGene. See Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies, for factors in concluding our ability to exert significant influence over BeiGene. The fair value of equity securities acquired exceeded our proportionate share of the carrying value of the underlying net assets of BeiGene by approximately $2.4 billion. The equity method of accounting requires us to identify and allocate amounts to items that give rise to the basis difference and to amortize these items over their useful lives. This amortization, along with our share of the results of operations of BeiGene, is included in Other income, net, in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Recognition occurs one quarter in arrears, which began in the second quarter of 2020. The basis difference was allocated to finite-lived intangible assets, indefinite-lived intangible assets, equity-method goodwill and related deferred taxes. The finite-lived intangible assets are being amortized over a period ranging from 8 to 15 years.\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the carrying value of the investment was reduced by our share of BeiGene's net losses of $265 million and $229 million, respectively, and amortization of the basis difference of $172 million and $109 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we increased the carrying value by $50 million and $569 million, respectively, as a result of our purchase of additional shares of BeiGene. In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020,  the  carrying  value  increased  by  $265  million  and  $34  million,  respectively,  from  the  impact  of  other  BeiGene  ownership transactions.",

Immediately following the terminations of these contracts, we entered into new interest rate swap agreements at then-current interest rates on the same $5.2 billion principal amount of notes. See Note 18, Derivative instruments.\n\nThe effective interest rates on notes for which we have entered into interest rate swap contracts and the related notional amounts of these contracts were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\n\n",

By 2023, the 2.45% 2030 Notes remained outstanding with a notional amount of $1.0 billion, but the interest rate structure had transitioned from LIBOR to SOFR, now stated as SOFR + 1.3%. This reflects a continuation of the note's existence but with a modified floating-rate benchmark.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 (2022) - Amgen entered into interest rate swaps for $1.0 billion of the 2.45% 2030 Notes, converting them to floating-rate debt based on LIBOR.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 (2023) - The 2.45% 2030 Notes remained outstanding with a notional amount of $1.0 billion, but the interest rate was now tied to SOFR + 1.3%.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The note itself remained in place, but its floating-rate mechanism evolved from LIBOR to SOFR, reflecting broader market shifts away from LIBOR."

In addition, all of our outstanding notes-except our 0.41% 2023 Swiss franc Bonds and Other notes  due  2097-may  be  redeemed  at  any  time  at  our  option-in  whole  or  in  part-at  the  principal  amounts  of  the  notes  being redeemed  plus  accrued  and  unpaid  interest  and  make-whole  amounts,  which  are  defined  by  the  terms  of  the  notes.  Certain  of  the redeemable notes do not require the payment of make-whole amounts if redeemed during a specified period of time immediately prior to the maturity of the notes. Such time periods range from one month to six months prior to maturity.\n\n## Debt issuances\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we issued debt securities in the following offerings:\n\n- In  2021, we issued $5.0 billion of debt consisting of $1.25 billion of the 1.65% 2028 Notes, $1.25 billion of the 2.00% 2032 Notes, $1.15 billion of the 2.80% 2041 Notes and $1.35 billion of the 3.00% 2052 Notes.\n- In  2020, we issued $9.0 billion of debt consisting of $500 million of the 1.90% 2025 Notes, $1.75 billion of the 2.20% 2027 Notes, $1.25 billion of the 2.45% 2030 Notes, $1.25 billion of the 2.30% 2031 Notes, $2.0 billion of the 3.15% 2040 Notes and $2.25 billion of the 3.375% 2050 Notes.\n\nWe did not issue any debt or debt securities during the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\n## Debt repayments/redemptions\n\nWe made debt repayments/redemptions during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, as follows:\n\n- In 2021, we redeemed $4.2 billion of debt, including the \u20ac1.25 billion aggregate principal amount ($1.4 billion upon settlement of the related cross-currency swap) of the 1.25% 2022 euro Notes, the $500 million aggregate principal amount of the 2.70% 2022 Notes, the $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2.65% 2022 Notes and the $750 million aggregate principal amount of the 3.625% 2022 Notes. In connection with the redemption of these notes, we paid a total of $24 million in make-whole amounts plus associated accrued and unpaid interest, all of which was recognized in Interest expense, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n- In 2020, we repaid/redeemed $6.5 billion of debt, including the repayment at maturity of the $300 million aggregate principal amount  of  the  4.50%  2020  Notes,  the  $750  million  aggregate  principal  amount  of  the  2.125%  2020  Notes,  the  $300  million Floating Rate Notes due 2020 and the $700 million aggregate principal amount of the 2.20% 2020 Notes. In connection with the redemption of the $900 million aggregate principal amount of the 3.45% 2020 Notes, the $1.0 billion aggregate principal balance of the 4.10% 2021 Notes, the $750 million aggregate principal balance of the 1.85% 2021 Notes and the $1.75 billion aggregate principal balance of the 3.875% 2021 Notes, we paid a total of $96 million in make-whole amounts plus associated accrued and unpaid interest, all of which was recognized in Interest expense, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n- In 2019, we repaid $4.5 billion of debt, including the $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2.20% 2019 Notes, the $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the 5.70% 2019 Notes, the \u20ac675 million aggregate principal amount ($864 million upon settlement of the related cross-currency swap) of the 2.125% 2019 euro Notes, the $700 million aggregate principal amount of the 1.90% 2019 Notes and the $550 million Floating Rate Notes due 2019.\n\n## Interest rate swaps\n\nTo achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted fixed-rate interest coupons for certain of our debt issuances to floating LIBOR-based coupons over the lives of the respective notes. These interest rate swap contracts qualified and are designated as fair value hedges.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we entered into interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $1.0 billion with respect to the 2.45% 2030 Notes and an aggregate notional amount of $500 million with respect to the 2.30% 2031 Notes. In connection with the redemption of the 3.625% 2022 Notes, discussed above, associated interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $750 million were terminated.",

      "answer": "ERLEADA's sales increased from $1,881 million in 2022 to $2,387 million in 2023, representing a 26.9% growth. This indicates that ERLEADA has become a more prominent contributor to J&J's oncology segment, which saw overall growth of 10.5% in 2023. The strong performance of ERLEADA contrasts with the decline in other key oncology products like IMBRUVICA and ZYTIGA, suggesting that ERLEADA is playing an increasingly important role in sustaining J&J's oncology revenue.",

Medical Devices in Interventional Solutions include Electrophysiology products (Biosense Webster) to treat cardiovascular diseases, Neurovascular care (Cerenovus) that treats hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke; the Orthopaedics portfolio (DePuy Synthes) is comprised of products in support of Hips, Knees, Trauma, and Spine, Sports &amp; Other; the Surgery portfolios include advanced and general surgery offerings (Ethicon), solutions that focus on Breast Aesthetics (Mentor) and Ear, Nose and Throat (Acclarent) procedures; and Johnson &amp; Johnson Vision products such as ACUVUE Brand disposable contact lenses and ophthalmic products related to cataract and laser refractive surgery. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used predominantly in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. Beginning in the fiscal first quarter of 2022, the Medical Devices segment will be referred to as the MedTech segment. \u00ae\n\n## Geographic Areas\n\nJohnson &amp; Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 141,700 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being.\n\nThe products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under '- Segments of Business - Consumer Health,' '- Pharmaceutical' and '- Medical Devices.' However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in international business include those developed in the U.S. and by subsidiaries abroad.\n\nInvestments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties.\n\n## Raw Materials\n\nRaw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where there are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company.\n\n## Patents\n\nThe Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible. They own, or are licensed under, a significant number of patents in the U.S. and other countries relating to their products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. The Company's subsidiaries face patent challenges from third parties, including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products.

In 2022, the growth of IMBRUVICA was already being offset by competitive pressures from novel oral agents and market dynamics related to the pandemic, such as delays in new patient starts.

          "chunk_text": "Immunology products achieved sales of $16.8 billion in 2021, representing an increase of 11.3% as compared to the prior year driven by strong uptake of STELARA (ustekinumab) in Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis and strength in TREMFYA (guselkumab) in Psoriasis and uptake in Psoriatic Arthritis. This was partially offset by lower sales of REMICADE (infliximab) due to biosimilar competition. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\nBiosimilar versions of REMICADE have been introduced in the United States and certain markets outside the United States and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition will result in a further reduction in sales of REMICADE . \u00ae \u00ae\n\nThe latest expiring United States patent for STELARA (ustekinumab) will expire in September 2023. STELARA (ustekinumab) U.S. sales in fiscal 2021 were approximately $5.9 billion. The expiration of a product patent or loss of market exclusivity is likely to result in a reduction in sales. \u00ae \u00ae\n\nInfectious disease products achieved sales of $5.9 billion in 2021, representing an increase of 64.0% as compared to the prior year. Growth was primarily driven by the contribution of the COVID-19 vaccine. This was partially offset by lower sales of PREZISTA and PREZCOBIX /REZOLSTA  (darunavir/cobicistat) due to increased competition and loss of exclusivity of PREZISTA in certain countries outside the U.S. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\nNeuroscience products achieved sales of $7.0 billion, representing an increase of 7.1% as compared to the prior year. Paliperidone long-acting injectables growth was driven by sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA /XEPLION  (paliperidone palmitate) and INVEGA TRINZA /TREVICTA  from new patient starts and persistence as well as the launch of INVEGA HAFYERA\u2122. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\nOncology products achieved sales of $14.5 billion in 2021, representing an increase of 17.6% as compared to the prior year. Contributors to the growth were strong sales of DARZALEX (daratumumab) driven by continued strong market growth, share gains in all regions and solid uptake of the subcutaneous formulation launched in 2020; the continued global launch uptake of ERLEADA  (apalutamide) and IMBRUVICA  (ibrutinib) growth primarily driven by market and continued share leadership. The growth of IMBRUVICA  (ibrutinib) was partially offset by competitive pressures from novel oral agents and COVID-19 related market dynamics including delays in new patient starts. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\nPulmonary Hypertension products achieved sales of $3.5 billion, representing an increase of 9.6% as compared to the prior year. Sales growth of OPSUMIT (macitentan) and UPTRAVI (selexipag) were due to continued share gains and market growth. \u00ae \u00ae\n\nCardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $4.5 billion, a decline of 8.6% as compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily attributable to lower sales of INVOKANA /INVOKAMET  (canagliflozin) due to share erosion and PROCRIT / EPREX (epoetin alfa) due to biosimilar competition. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae",

Refer to Note 5 for additional information regarding these acquisitions and related adjustments. In 2021, AbbVie also reclassified $1.0 billion of indefinite-lived research and development intangible assets to developed product rights upon receiving certain regulatory approvals for Vuity, Qulipta, and HArmonyCa.\n\nDefinite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range between 1 to 16 years with an average of 12 years for developed product rights and 11 years for license agreements. Amortization expense was $7.7 billion in 2021, $5.8 billion in 2020 and $1.6 billion in 2019 and was included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings. The anticipated annual amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2021 is as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How did the global revenue performance of Mavyret evolve between 2022 and 2023, and what were the trends in its United States and international markets during this period?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Mavyret generated total global revenue of $1,541 million, with $755 million from the United States and $786 million from international markets. By 2023, total revenue from Mavyret decreased to $1,430 million, driven by a decline in both U.S. and international markets. Specifically, U.S. revenue dropped to $659 million, a decrease of 12.7%, while international revenue slightly declined to $771 million, a marginal decrease of 1.9%. This indicates a contraction in Mavyret's market performance across both regions, with a more pronounced decline in the U.S. market.",

These products are:\n\nMavyret/Maviret. Mavyret (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir) is approved in the United States and European Union (Maviret) for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients (12 years and older or weighing at least 45 kilograms) with chronic HCV genotype 1-6 infection without cirrhosis and with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A). It is also indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients (12 years and older or weighing at least 45 kilograms) with HCV genotype 1 infection, who previously have been treated with a regimen containing an HCV NS5A inhibitor or an NS3/4A protease inhibitor, but not both. It is an 8-week, pan-genotypic treatment for patients without cirrhosis and following the EXPEDITION-8 study, also in patients with compensated cirrhosis who are new to treatment.\n\nCreon. Creon (pancrelipase) is a pancreatic enzyme therapy for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, a condition that occurs in patients with cystic fibrosis, chronic pancreatitis and several other conditions.\n\nLupron. Lupron (leuprolide acetate), which is also marketed as Lucrin and Lupron Depot, is a product for the palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer, treatment of endometriosis and central precocious puberty and for the preoperative treatment of patients with anemia caused by uterine fibroids. Lupron is approved for daily subcutaneous injection and one-month, three-month, four-month and six-month intramuscular injection.\n\nLinzess/Constella. Linzess (linaclotide) is a once-daily guanylate cyclase-C agonist used in adults to treat irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) and chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC). The product is marketed as Linzess in the United States and as Constella outside of the United States.\n\nSynthroid. Synthroid (levothyroxine sodium tablets, USP) is used in the treatment of hypothyroidism.\n\nAbbVie has the rights to sell Creon and Synthroid only in the United States.\n\n## Marketing, Sales and Distribution Capabilities\n\nAbbVie utilizes a combination of dedicated commercial resources, regional commercial resources and distributorships to market, sell and distribute its products worldwide. AbbVie directs its primary marketing efforts toward securing the prescription, or recommendation, of its brand of products by physicians, key opinion leaders and other health care providers. Managed care providers (for example, health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit managers), hospitals and state and federal government agencies (for example, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and the United States Department of Defense) are also important customers. AbbVie also markets directly to consumers themselves, although in the United States many of the company's products must be sold pursuant to a prescription. Outside of the United States, AbbVie focuses its promotional and market access efforts on key opinion leaders, payers, physicians and health systems. AbbVie also provides patient support programs closely related to its products. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic AbbVie has maintained its promotional activities with key stakeholders by leveraging digital engagement where permitted and in compliance with the locally applicable government guidance.\n\nAbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain products (including aesthetic products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. Although AbbVie's business does not have significant seasonality, AbbVie's product revenues may be affected by end customer and retail buying patterns, fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels and other factors.\n\nIn the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies, patients or other customers. In 2021, three wholesale distributors (McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Corporation) accounted for substantially all of AbbVie's pharmaceutical product sales in the United States. No individual wholesaler accounted for greater than 37% of AbbVie's 2021 gross revenues in the United States. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served.\n\nCertain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie has no single customer that, if the customer were lost, would have a material adverse effect on the company's business. No material portion of AbbVie's business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government. Orders are generally filled on a current basis and order backlog is not material to AbbVie's business.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe markets for AbbVie's products are highly competitive. AbbVie competes with other research-based pharmaceuticals and biotechnology companies that discover, manufacture, market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products, therapies",

      "answer": "In 2022, Qulipta was part of a group of products that received regulatory approvals, leading to the reclassification of $1.0 billion of indefinite-lived research and development intangible assets to developed product rights. By 2023, AbbVie had introduced Qulipta with specific regulatory milestones: it received FDA approval in April 2023 for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine in adults and EC approval in August 2023 for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults with four or more migraine days per month. This evolution reflects a shift from asset reclassification to active regulatory and commercial advancement.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Qulipta was among the products that triggered the reclassification of $1.0 billion in intangible assets upon receiving regulatory approvals.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, Qulipta transitioned to a more mature stage with specific regulatory approvals from both the FDA and EC, indicating active commercial development.",
        "Step 3: The change represents a transformation from internal asset reclassification to external regulatory and market introduction, marking a significant evolution in Qulipta's lifecycle."

Refer to Note 5 for additional information regarding these acquisitions and related adjustments. In 2021, AbbVie also reclassified $1.0 billion of indefinite-lived research and development intangible assets to developed product rights upon receiving certain regulatory approvals for Vuity, Qulipta, and HArmonyCa.\n\nDefinite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range between 1 to 16 years with an average of 12 years for developed product rights and 11 years for license agreements. Amortization expense was $7.7 billion in 2021, $5.8 billion in 2020 and $1.6 billion in 2019 and was included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings.

      "answer": "In 2022, the risk of competitors developing after-market parts was described as a direct threat that could 'detract from our sales,' with an emphasis on how commoditization and private-label offerings could reduce market prices and erode DHR's competitive position. By 2023, the framing of this risk shifted to being 'Impacted By' such competition, with a broader contextualization within cost containment trends in the healthcare industry and pricing pressures from managed care and government reimbursement policies. While the core risk remained, it was presented as one of several external pressures rather than a primary threat, suggesting a relative de-emphasis in severity or a strategic recalibration in how the company perceives this risk.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, the document explicitly stated that competitors developing after-market parts could 'detract from our sales,' highlighting a direct and significant impact on revenue.",

        "Step 3: The change in framing suggests that while the risk remains relevant, its perceived prominence or impact on the business has evolved from a central competitive threat to a component of broader industry cost pressures."

          "chunk_text": "## We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share. Even if we compete effectively, we may be required to reduce the prices we charge.\n\nOur businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation. Because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of competitors; refer to 'Item 1. Business-Competition' for additional details. In order to compete effectively, we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers, continually developing new products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrating new markets, including high-growth markets. Our ability to compete can also be impacted by changing customer preferences and requirements (for example increased demand for products incorporating digital capabilities or more environmentally-friendly products and supplier practices) as well as changes in the way healthcare services are delivered (including the movement of some care from acute to non-acute settings and increased focus on chronic disease management). Cost containment efforts by governments and the private sector, particularly in the healthcare industry, are also resulting in increased emphasis on products that reduce costs and improve efficiency and effectiveness. In addition, significant shifts in industry market share have occurred and may in the future occur in connection with product problems, safety alerts and publications about products, reflecting the competitive significance of product quality, product efficacy and quality systems in our industry. Our failure to compete effectively and/or pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our business and financial statements, and our expansion into new markets may result in greater-than-expected risks, liabilities and expenses. In addition, the Company's competitors and customers have from time to time introduced, and may in the future introduce, private label, generic or low-cost products that compete with the Company's products at lower price points. Competitors' products can capture significant market share or lead to a decrease in market prices overall, resulting in an adverse effect on the Company's business and financial statements.\n\n## Our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization, and customer acceptance, of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation.\n\nWe generally sell our products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards. If we do not develop innovative new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis, our offerings will become obsolete over time and our business and financial statements will suffer. Our success depends on several factors, including our ability to:\n\n- correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences;\n- allocate our R&amp;D funding to products and services with higher growth prospects;\n- anticipate and respond to our competitors' development of new products and services and technological innovations;\n- differentiate our offerings from our competitors' offerings and avoid commoditization;\n- innovate and develop new technologies and applications, and acquire or obtain rights to third-party technologies that may have valuable applications in our served markets;\n- obtain adequate intellectual property rights with respect to key technologies before our competitors do;\n- successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner, price them competitively and cost-effectively manufacture and deliver sufficient volumes of new products of appropriate quality on time;\n- obtain necessary regulatory approvals of appropriate scope (including with respect to medical device products by demonstrating satisfactory clinical results where applicable as well as achieving third-party reimbursement); and\n- stimulate customer demand for and convince customers to adopt new technologies.\n\nIf we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest heavily in R&amp;D of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue, which would adversely affect our business and financial statements. Even when we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services, we often incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may suffer. In addition, promising new offerings may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, uncertainty over third-party reimbursement or entrenched patterns of clinical practice. Competitors may also develop after-market services and parts for our products which may detract from our sales.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the Aldevron acquisition contributed to a $59 million increase in cost of sales due to fair value adjustments to inventory. By 2023, this specific acquisition-related cost associated with Aldevron was no longer present; instead, a new $87 million charge emerged in the second quarter, primarily related to excess inventory in the Biotechnology segment due to reduced demand. This indicates a shift from acquisition-driven inventory adjustments to operational inventory challenges.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-10 Government Assistance (Topic 832) , which requires annual disclosures of transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy. These required disclosures include information on the nature of transactions and related accounting policies used to account for transactions, detail on the line items on the balance sheet and income statement affected by these transactions including amounts applicable to each line, and significant terms and conditions of the transactions including commitments and contingencies. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. The Company receives various forms of government assistance, primarily through grants related to the development of new products and the expansion of production capacity. During 2021, certain agencies of the U.S. government, including the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority ('BARDA') within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, agreed to finance an expansion of production capacity related to chromatography, liquid cell culture media, buffers and cell culture powder media and single-use consumables at certain of the Company's Life Sciences businesses and the development of diagnostics testing technologies and the expansion of testing production capacity at certain of the Company's Diagnostics businesses. The Company's businesses may enter into similar agreements in the future. In consideration of this financing the U.S. government has certain rights, including rights with respect to the allocation of certain of the incremental production capacity associated with such expansion and/or rights in intellectual property produced with its financial assistance. The amount awarded pursuant to these grants in 2021 totaled $568 million and will be paid over periods ranging from one year to four years. In 2021, the Company received aggregate payments related to government grants of $73 million that offset operating expenses and capital expenditures of $41 million and $32 million, respectively. The Company is still assessing the impact of this ASU and the required disclosures, however, management anticipates the adoption of this ASU will not have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.\n\n## NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS\n\nThe Company continually evaluates potential acquisitions that either strategically fit with the Company's existing portfolio or expand the Company's portfolio into a new and attractive business area. The Company has completed a number of acquisitions that have been accounted for as purchases and have resulted in the recognition of goodwill in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. This goodwill arises because the purchase prices for these businesses exceeds the fair value of acquired identifiable net assets due to the purchase prices reflecting a number of factors including the future earnings and cash flow potential of these businesses, the multiple to earnings, cash flow and other factors at which similar businesses have been purchased by other acquirers, the competitive nature of the processes by which the Company acquired the businesses, the avoidance of the time and costs which would be required (and the associated risks that would be encountered) to enhance the Company's existing product offerings to key target markets and enter into new and profitable businesses and the complementary strategic fit and resulting synergies these businesses bring to existing operations.\n\nThe Company makes an initial allocation of the purchase price at the date of acquisition based upon its understanding of the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. The Company obtains the information used for the purchase price allocation during due diligence and through other sources. In the months after closing, as the Company obtains additional information about the acquired assets and liabilities, including through tangible and intangible asset appraisals, and learns more about the newly acquired business, it is able to refine the estimates of fair value and more accurately allocate the purchase price. The fair values of acquired intangibles are determined based on estimates and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by the Company. Significant assumptions include the discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results of the acquired business including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ('EBITDA'), revenue, revenue growth rates, royalty rates and technology obsolescence rates. These assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. The Company engages third-party valuation specialists who review the Company's critical assumptions and calculations of the fair value of acquired intangible assets in connection with significant acquisitions. Only facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date are considered for subsequent adjustment. The Company is continuing to evaluate certain preacquisition contingencies associated with certain of its 2021 acquisitions and is also in the process of obtaining valuations of certain acquisition-related assets and liabilities in connection with these acquisitions. The Company will make appropriate adjustments to the purchase price allocation prior to completion of the measurement period, as required.\n\nThe following briefly describes the Company's acquisition activity for the three years ended December 31, 2021.\n\nOn August 30, 2021, the Company acquired Aldevron, L.L.C. ('Aldevron') for a cash purchase price of approximately $9.6 billion (the 'Aldevron Acquisition'). Aldevron manufactures high-quality plasmid DNA, mRNA and proteins, serving biotechnology and pharmaceutical customers across research, clinical and commercial applications, and is now part of the Company's Life Sciences segment. Aldevron generated revenues of approximately $300 million in 2020. The acquisition of Aldevron is expected to provide additional sales and earnings opportunities for the Company by expanding product line diversity, including new product offerings supporting genomic medicine.

The Company preliminarily recorded approximately $6.1 billion of goodwill related to the Aldevron Acquisition.\n\nDuring 2021, in addition to the Aldevron Acquisition, the Company acquired 13 businesses for total consideration of approximately $1.4 billion in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of each of the Company's three segments. The Company preliminarily recorded an aggregate of approximately $1.1 billion of goodwill related to these acquisitions. The aggregate annual sales of the 13 other businesses acquired in 2021 at the time of their acquisition, in each case based on the company's revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $100 million.\n\nOn March 31, 2020, the Company acquired the Biopharma business of General Electric Company's ('GE') Life Sciences division, now known as Cytiva, for a cash purchase price of approximately $20.7 billion (net of approximately $0.1 billion of acquired cash) and the assumption of approximately $0.4 billion of pension liabilities (the 'Cytiva Acquisition'). Cytiva is a leading provider of instruments, consumables and software that support the research, discovery, process development and manufacturing workflows of biopharmaceutical drugs. Cytiva is included in the Company's Life Sciences segment results beginning in the second quarter of 2020. The acquisition has provided and is expected to continue to provide additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the Company's Life Sciences segment by expanding the business' geographic and product line diversity, including new product and service offerings that complement the Company's current biologics workflow solutions. To fulfill a condition to obtaining certain regulatory approvals for the closing of the transaction, on April 30, 2020 the Company divested certain of its existing product lines in the Life Sciences segment for a cash purchase price, net of cash transferred and transaction costs, of $826 million and recognized a pretax gain on sale of $455 million ($305 million after-tax or $0.42 per diluted common share). The divested product lines in the aggregate generated revenues of approximately $170 million in 2019. The divestiture of these product lines did not represent a strategic shift with a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results and therefore is not reported as a discontinued operation.\n\nThe Company financed the Cytiva Acquisition with approximately $3.0 billion of proceeds from the 2019 underwritten public offerings of its Common Stock and Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock ('MCPS Series A'), approximately $10.8 billion of proceeds from the 2019 issuance of euro-denominated and U.S. dollar-denominated long-term debt, and approximately $6.9 billion from the aggregate of proceeds from commercial paper borrowings, borrowings under the Company's Five-Year Facility (as defined below) and cash on hand. The Company recorded approximately $10.2 billion of goodwill related to the Cytiva Acquisition.\n\nDuring 2020, in addition to the Cytiva Acquisition, the Company acquired four businesses for total consideration of $256 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of the Company's Life Sciences and Environmental &amp; Applied Solutions segments. The Company recorded an aggregate of $231 million of goodwill related to these acquisitions. The aggregate annual sales of the five businesses acquired in 2020 at the time of their acquisition, in each case based on the company's revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $3.3 billion.\n\nDuring 2019, the Company acquired five business for total consideration of $331 million in cash, net of cash acquired.

      "answer": "In 2022, DHR anticipated capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion, with a portion of this spending attributed to increased manufacturing capacity for products related to the Aldevron Acquisition, among others. This reflects a growing capital commitment tied to Aldevron. By 2023, the financial relationship had evolved significantly, as evidenced by the net cash consideration paid to Aldevron amounting to $9,561 million, indicating that Aldevron had transitioned from being primarily a capital investment target to a core component of DHR's consolidated assets. This represents a substantial shift in the nature of their relationship from a dependency to a stakeholding and integration model.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, DHR projected capital expenditures of $1.5 billion, with Aldevron contributing to increased manufacturing capacity investments.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, DHR reported a net cash consideration of $9,561 million paid to Aldevron, indicating a major acquisition or consolidation of Aldevron into DHR\u2019s financial structure.",
        "Step 3: The evolution from capital investment planning in 2022 to a significant acquisition payment in 2023 shows a transformation in the relationship from operational dependency to strategic ownership."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Capital Expenditures\n\nCapital expenditures are made primarily for increasing manufacturing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting new product development, improving information technology systems and the manufacture of instruments that are used in operating-type lease arrangements that certain of the Company's businesses enter into with customers. Capital expenditures totaled approximately $1.3 billion in 2021 and $791 million in 2020. The year-over-year increase in capital spending in 2021 was primarily due to incremental capital expenditures to increase manufacturing capacity for diagnostic testing and biopharma products (including to address increased COVID-19 related demand) as well as incremental capital expenditures as a result of the Cytiva and Aldevron Acquisitions. In 2022, the Company expects to incur higher capital spending than the prior year to increase manufacturing capacity primarily to support customer demand for products related to testing, treatment and vaccine production for COVID-19 and other growth opportunities. The Company estimates capital expenditures in 2022 to be approximately $1.5 billion.\n\nDuring 2021, certain agencies of the U.S. government, including BARDA, agreed to finance an expansion of production capacity related to chromatography, liquid cell culture media, buffers and cell culture powder media and single-use consumables at certain of the Company's Life Sciences businesses and the development of diagnostics testing technologies and the expansion of testing production capacity at certain of the Company's Diagnostics businesses. The Company's businesses may enter into similar agreements in the future. In consideration of this financing the U.S. government has certain rights, including rights with respect to the allocation of certain of the incremental production capacity associated with such expansion and/or rights in intellectual property produced with its financial assistance. The amount awarded pursuant to these grants in 2021 totaled $568 million and will be paid over periods ranging from one to four years. In 2021, the Company received aggregate payments related to government grants of $73 million that offset operating expenses and capital expenditures of $41 million and $32 million, respectively.\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nCash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with the issuance and repayments of commercial paper, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, borrowings under committed credit facilities, issuance and repurchases of common stock, issuance of preferred stock and payments of cash dividends to shareholders. Financing activities provided cash of approximately $1.3 billion during 2021 compared to approximately $1.0 billion of cash provided during 2020. The year-over-year increase in cash provided by financing activities was due primarily to cash provided in 2021 from the issuance of commercial paper used to fund a portion of the Aldevron Acquisition and the issuance of debt securities in the fourth quarter of 2021, partially offset by cash provided by the sale of common and preferred stock and borrowings incurred in 2020 to finance the remaining amounts needed to acquire Cytiva and for general corporate purposes, as well as the issuance of debt securities in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nTotal debt was approximately $22.2 billion and $21.2 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and notes payable and current portion of long-term debt was $8 million and $11 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had the ability to incur approximately $2.2 billion of additional indebtedness in direct borrowings or under the outstanding commercial paper facilities based on the amounts available under the Company's $5.0 billion Five-Year Facility which were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has classified approximately $2.8 billion of its borrowings outstanding under the U.S. dollar and euro-denominated commercial paper program, $699 million of borrowings outstanding under the 2022 Biopharma Notes and $284 million of borrowings outstanding under the Floating Rate 2022 Euronotes as long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as the Company has the intent and ability, as supported by availability under the Five-Year Facility, to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date. As commercial paper obligations mature, the Company may issue additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings, to the extent commercial paper markets are available.\n\nUnder the Company's U.S. dollar and euro-denominated commercial paper program, the notes are typically issued at a discount from par, generally based on the ratings assigned to the Company by credit rating agencies at the time of the issuance and prevailing market rates measured by reference to LIBOR or EURIBOR. Additionally, the Company's floating rate senior unsecured notes due 2022 pay interest based upon the three-month EURIBOR plus 0.3%. In July 2017, the head of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced the intent to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, a new index calculated by shortterm repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities. The Company has evaluated the anticipated impact of the transition from LIBOR and does not expect the transition to be material to the Company's financial position. The U.S. dollar LIBOR-based borrowings will be available to the Company under the Five-Year Facility until 2023, upon the discontinuance of LIBOR. Prior to the discontinuation of LIBOR, the Company expects to amend the Five-Year Facility to replace LIBOR with another reference interest rate.",

      "answer": "In the 2022 filing, DHR reported impairment triggers only in the Diagnostics segment during the first quarter of 2021, resulting in a $10 million impairment charge. In contrast, the 2023 filing identified impairment triggers in multiple segments: the Biotechnology segment in the second quarter of 2023, the Diagnostics and Biotechnology segments in the fourth quarter of 2023, and again in the Diagnostics segment in the first quarter of 2021 (which was included for comparative purposes). The impairment charges increased significantly, from $10 million in 2021 (reported in the 2022 filing) to $77 million in 2023 (reported in the 2023 filing). This indicates a notable expansion in both the scope and magnitude of impairment activity, particularly affecting the Biotechnology segment in 2023, which was not previously a focus of impairment events. This evolution suggests growing risks in DHR\u2019s intangible asset portfolio, especially in its Biotechnology segment.",

During 2020, the Company acquired finite-lived intangible assets, consisting primarily of developed technology, customer relationships and trade names, with a weighted average life of 17 years primarily as a result of the Cytiva Acquisition. Refer to Note 2 for additional information on the intangible assets acquired.\n\nThe Company reviews identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists. The Company identified impairment triggers during the first quarter of 2021 in the Diagnostics segment and the first and third quarters of 2020 in the Diagnostics and Environmental &amp; Applied Solutions segments which resulted in the impairment of certain long-lived assets, including trade names and other intangible assets. In 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded impairment charges totaling $10 million and $22 million, respectively, related to these long-lived assets in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\n\nTotal intangible amortization expense in 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $1,450 million, $1,138 million and $625 million, respectively. The increase in intangible amortization expense in 2021 and 2020 was primarily as a result of the Aldevron and Cytiva acquisitions and the amortization of the associated finite-lived intangible assets. Based on the intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2021, amortization expense is estimated to be approximately $1.5 billion during 2022, $1.5 billion during 2023, $1.5 billion during 2024, $1.5 billion during 2025 and $1.4 billion during 2026.\n\n## NOTE 12. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\n\nAccounting standards define fair value based on an exit price model, establish a framework for measuring fair value where the Company's assets and liabilities are required to be carried at fair value and provide for certain disclosures related to the valuation methods used within a valuation hierarchy as established within the accounting standards. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, or other observable characteristics for the asset or liability, including interest rates, yield curves and credit risks, or inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data through correlation. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on the Company's assumptions. A financial asset or liability's classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.",

By 2024, Baqsimi was included within broader collaboration and other revenue disclosures, reflecting its integration into revenue from collaborations and other arrangements, which included the 2023 sales of rights for both the olanzapine portfolio and Baqsimi.

          "chunk_text": "We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that hav e a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to hav e a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, rev enues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. We acquire and collaborate on potential products still in dev elopment and enter into research and dev elopment arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third-party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future ev ents linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achiev ement of an important point in the dev elopment life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approv al for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achiev ement of certain sales lev els). If required by the arrangement, we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the product in the ev ent that regulatory approv al for marketing is obtained.\n\nIndiv idually, these arrangements are generally not material in any one annual reporting period. Howev er, if milestones for multiple products cov ered by these arrangements were reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate expense or aggregate milestone payments made could be material to our results of operations or cash flows, respectiv ely, in that period. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. These arrangements often giv e us the discretion to unilaterally terminate dev elopment of the product, which would allow us to av oid making the contingent payments; however, we are unlikely to cease dev elopment if the compound successfully achiev es milestone objectiv es. We v iew these payments as positiv e because they signify that the product is successfully mov ing through dev elopment and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products.\n\n## APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, rev enues, expenses, and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjectiv e and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any giv en indiv idual estimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could dev elop different estimates. We believ e that, giv en current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adv erse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our most critical accounting estimates hav e been discussed with our audit committee and are described below.\n\n## Revenue Recognition and Sales Return, Rebate, and Discount Accruals\n\n## Background and Uncertainties\n\nWe recognize revenue primarily from two different types of contracts, product sales to customers (net product rev enue) and collaborations and other arrangements. For product sales to customers, prov isions for returns, rebates and discounts are established in the same period the related product sales are recognized. To determine the appropriate transaction price for our product sales at the time we recognize a sale to a direct customer, we estimate any rebates or discounts that ultimately will be due to the direct customer and other customers in the distribution chain under the terms of our contracts. Significant judgments are required in making these estimates. The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts include rebates associated with sales cov ered by managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, and chargeback programs, as well as reductions in rev enue related to our patient assistance programs, in the U.S. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical rebate payments for these programs, as well as patient assistance program costs, by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g., patent expiries and product launches), an ev aluation of the current contracts for these programs, the percentage of our products that are sold v ia these programs, and our product pricing. Although we accrue a liability for rev enue reductions related to these programs at the time we record the sale, the reduction related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later. Because of this time lag, in any particular period our net product rev enue may incorporate rev isions of accruals for sev eral periods.\n\nRefer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on rev enue recognition and sales return, rebate, and discount accruals.\n\nRevenue recognized from collaborations and other arrangements includes our share of profits from the collaborations, as well as royalties, upfront and milestone payments we receiv e under these types of contracts.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Baqsimi contributed $677.6 million in total revenue, with $645.7 million from the U.S. and $31.9 million from outside the U.S., indicating it was still a growing product within LLY's portfolio. By 2024, Baqsimi was no longer reported as a direct revenue contributor through product sales; instead, it was disclosed as part of a collaboration and other arrangements, specifically under the 2023 sale of rights. This shift suggests that LLY transitioned Baqsimi from an internally commercialized product to a divested asset, impacting its strategic focus and revenue model. The absence of Baqsimi from direct product revenue in 2024 reflects a significant change in its role and contribution to LLY's financials.",

      "question": "How did the nature of LLY's revenue from Zyprexa evolve between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of the source and recognition method of that revenue?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Zyprexa revenue was primarily derived from the sale of the rights for the olanzapine portfolio. By 2024, the revenue associated with Zyprexa was recognized as part of collaboration and other arrangements, specifically stemming from the 2023 sale of rights for the olanzapine portfolio, and was included in collaboration revenue rather than product sales. This reflects a shift in how Zyprexa-related revenue was categorized and recognized in 2024 compared to 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, Zyprexa revenue was tied directly to the sale of rights for the olanzapine portfolio and was listed among product revenues with a specific note.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, Zyprexa-related revenue was included in collaboration and other arrangements, specifically referencing the 2023 sale, and was no longer categorized under direct product sales.",
        "Step 3: The change indicates a transformation in the revenue recognition method and categorization of Zyprexa-related income from direct product revenue to collaborative arrangement revenue."

      "answer": "In 2022, Biktarvy was a major revenue driver for GILD, generating $8,624 million in total product sales globally, indicating its strong market position in the HIV treatment segment. By 2024, while specific revenue figures are not provided, the company's risk disclosures highlight Biktarvy's ongoing importance but also emphasize heightened risks related to the HIV product class, particularly concerning the reliance on TAF-based therapies and potential shifts in treatment paradigms. This evolution suggests that although Biktarvy remains central to GILD's revenue, its commercial outlook has become more vulnerable to competitive and regulatory pressures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Biktarvy generated $8,624 million in total sales, making it one of GILD\u2019s highest-performing HIV products.",
        "Step 2: By 2024, Biktarvy is not explicitly mentioned in terms of revenue, but it is implicitly central to the company's risk profile, with specific concerns raised about TAF-based therapies and market sustainability.",
        "Step 3: The shift from a revenue-centric view in 2022 to a risk-focused narrative in 2024 indicates that while Biktarvy remains commercially significant, its role has evolved to include greater strategic vulnerability."

RISK FACTORS\n\nIn evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the following discussion of material risks, events and uncertainties that make an investment in us speculative or risky in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A manifestation of any of the following risks and uncertainties could,  in  circumstances  we  may  or  may  not  be  able  to  accurately  predict,  materially  and  adversely  affect  our  business  and  operations,  growth,  reputation (including the commercial or scientific reputation of our products), prospects, product pipeline and sales, operating and financial results, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and stock price. W e note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors; our operations could also be affected by factors, events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. Therefore, you should not consider the following risks to be a complete statement of all the potential risks or uncertainties that we face. Moreover, some of the factors, events and contingencies discussed below may have occurred in the past, but the disclosures below are not representations as to whether or not the factors, events or contingencies have occurred in the past, and instead reflect our beliefs and opinions as to the factors, events or contingencies that could materially and adversely affect us in the future.\n\n## Product and Commercialization Risks\n\n## Certain of our products subject us to additional or heightened risks.\n\n## HIV\n\nWe receive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales of our products for the treatment and prevention of HIV  infection. We may be unable to sustain or increase sales of our HIV  products for any number of reasons, including market share gains by competitive products, including generics, or the inability to introduce new HIV medications necessary to remain competitive. In such case, we may need to scale back our operations, including our future drug development and spending on research and development ('R&amp;D') efforts. For example, many of our HIV  products contain tenofovir alafenamide ('TAF'), which belongs to the nucleoside class of antiviral therapeutics. If there are any changes to the treatment or prevention paradigm for HIV , and nucleoside-based therapeutics do not remain the preferred regimen, our HIV product sales would be adversely impacted.\n\n## Cell Therapy\n\nAdvancing a novel and personalized therapy such as Y escarta or Tecartus, which are chimeric antigen receptor ('CAR') T-cell therapies, creates significant challenges, including:\n\n- educating and certifying medical personnel regarding the procedures and the potential side effects, such as cytokine release syndrome and neurologic toxicities, in compliance with the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ('FDA');\n- securing sufficient supply of other medications to manage side effects, such as tocilizumab and corticosteroids, which may not be available in sufficient quantities, may not adequately control the side effects and/or may have detrimental impacts on the efficacy of cell therapy;\n- developing and maintaining a robust and reliable process for engineering a patient's T cells in our facilities and infusing them back into the patient; and\n- conditioning patients with chemotherapy in advance of administering our therapy, which may increase the risk of adverse side effects.\n\nThe use of engineered T cells as a potential cancer treatment is a recent development and may not be broadly accepted by physicians, patients, hospitals, cancer treatment centers, payers and others in the medical community. For example, in January 2024, FDA instituted a class labeling change for all approved CAR Tcell therapies, including a 'boxed warning' about the possible risk of secondary T-cell malignancies in patients treated with CAR T-cell therapy. For challenges related to the reimbursement of Y escarta and Tecartus, see also ' Our existing products are subject to reimbursement pressures from government agencies and other third parties, required rebates and discounts, and other pricing pressures.'\n\nWe rely on third-party sites to collect patients' white blood cells, known as apheresis centers, as well as shippers, couriers, and hospitals for the logistical collection of patients' white blood cells and ultimate delivery of Y escarta and Tecartus to patients. These vendors may encounter disruptions or difficulties that could result in product loss and regulatory action. Apheresis centers may also choose not to participate in our quality certification process, or we may be unable to complete such certification in a timely manner or at all, which could delay or constrain our manufacturing and commercialization efforts.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Biktarvy was listed among GILD\u2019s key marketed products, indicating its central role in the company's HIV portfolio and suggesting strong commercial positioning. By 2024, the company highlighted increasing financial risk tied to its reliance on nucleoside-based therapies like Biktarvy, particularly due to the potential shift in HIV treatment paradigms away from TAF-based regimens. This evolution reflects a growing concern over Biktarvy\u2019s long-term competitive differentiation and its ability to sustain revenue, especially in the face of rising generic competition and changing therapeutic preferences.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, Biktarvy was identified as a core marketed product, underscoring its strategic and likely financial importance to GILD\u2019s HIV portfolio.",

        "Step 3: The shift from product listing to risk disclosure indicates a change in strategic positioning\u2014from a key revenue driver to a potential source of financial vulnerability."

ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## Overview\n\nGilead  Sciences,  Inc.  ('Gilead,'  'we,'  'our'  or  'us')  is  a  biopharmaceutical  company  that  has  pursued  and  achieved breakthroughs in medicine for more than three decades, with the goal of creating a healthier world for all people. We are committed to  advancing  innovative  medicines  to  prevent  and  treat  life-threatening  diseases,  including  HIV ,  viral  hepatitis  and  cancer.  We operate in more than 35 countries worldwide, with headquarters in Foster City, California.\n\nOur portfolio of marketed products includes AmBisome , Atripla , Biktarvy , Cayston , Complera , Descovy , Descovy for PrEP , Emtriva , Epclusa , Eviplera , Genvoya , Harvoni , Hepcludex (bulevirtide), Hepsera , Jyseleca (filgotinib), Letairis , Odefsey ,  Ranexa ,  Sovaldi ,  Stribild ,  Tecartus ,  Trodelvy ,  Truvada ,  Truvada  for  PrEP ,  Tybost ,  Veklury ,  Vemlidy , Viread ,  V osevi ,  Yescarta and  Zydelig .  The  approval  status  of  Hepcludex  and  Jyseleca  vary  worldwide,  and  Hepcludex  and Jyseleca are not approved in the United States. We also sell and distribute authorized generic versions of Epclusa and Harvoni in the United States through our separate subsidiary, Asegua Therapeutics, LLC. In addition, we sell and distribute certain products through our corporate partners under collaborative agreements. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Gilead, our wholly-owned subsidiaries and certain variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. For consolidated entities where we own or are exposed to less than 100% of the economics, we record net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in our Consolidated Statements of Income equal to the percentage of the economic or ownership interest retained in such entities by the respective noncontrolling parties.\n\nWe assess whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity ('VIE') at the inception of the arrangement and at each reporting date. This assessment is based on our power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and our obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We did not have any material VIEs as of December 31, 2021.\n\nCertain reclassifications have been made to prior periods in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes to conform with the current presentation. Beginning 2020, acquired in-process research and development ('IPR&amp;D') expenses are reported  separately  from  Research  and  development  expenses  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income.  Our  Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was conformed to separately present acquired IPR&amp;D expenses.\n\n## Segment Information\n\nWe have one operating segment which primarily focuses on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative medicines  in  areas  of  unmet  medical  need.  Our  Chief  Executive  Officer,  as  the  chief  operating  decision-maker  ('CODM'), manages and allocates resources to the operations of our company on an entity-wide basis. Managing and allocating resources on an entity-wide basis enables our CODM to assess the overall level of resources available and how to best deploy these resources across  functions  and  research  and  development  ('R&amp;D')  projects  based  on  unmet  medical  need  and,  as  necessary,  reallocate resources among our internal R&amp;D portfolio and external opportunities to best support the long-term growth of our business. See Note 2. Revenues for a summary of disaggregated revenues by product and geographic region.\n\n## Significant Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments\n\nThe preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires  us  to  make  estimates  and  judgments  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets,  liabilities,  revenues  and  expenses  and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our significant accounting policies and estimates. We base our estimates on historical  experience  and  on  various  market-specific  and  other  relevant  assumptions  that  we  believe  to  be  reasonable  under  the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Estimates are assessed each period and updated to reflect current information, such as the economic considerations related to the impact that the coronavirus disease ('COVID-19') could have on our significant accounting estimates. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Biktarvy was positioned as a key growth driver for Gilead, with the company noting its 'continued growth in all geographies' and attributing part of the 11% revenue increase to its performance. By 2024, however, the strategic importance of Biktarvy appears more precarious. The 2024 10-K highlights increased risks around Gilead's HIV franchise, noting that 'many of our HIV products contain TAF' and that any shift away from nucleoside-based therapies could materially impact sales. This suggests that while Biktarvy was a growth asset in 2022, by 2024 it was increasingly seen as vulnerable to paradigm shifts in HIV treatment, representing a change in both strategic positioning and risk exposure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 - In 2022, Biktarvy was highlighted as a growth contributor with continued uptake across geographies, supporting an 11% revenue increase.",

        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The change reflects a shift from viewing Biktarvy as a growth engine in 2022 to seeing it as a potentially vulnerable asset in 2024 due to evolving treatment risks."

The increase also reflects the continued growth of Biktarvy in all geographies and the continued uptake of Trodelvy, Cell Therapy and chronic hepatitis B virus ('HBV') and HDV products.  The  increases  were  partially  offset  by  the  decrease  in  Truvada  and  Atripla  sales  in  the  United  States,  as  expected, primarily due to the continued generic competition following the October 2020 loss of exclusivity in the United States.\n\nNet income attributable to Gilead was $6.2 billion or $4.93 diluted earnings per share in 2021, compared to $123 million or $0.10 diluted earnings per share in 2020. The increase was primarily due to lower acquired in-process research and development ('IPR&amp;D') charges, revenue growth and lower unrealized losses from our equity investments, partially offset by a $1.25 billion charge for a settlement related to bictegravir litigation, and a charge of $625 million related to the Arcus collaboration opt-in. Our acquired IPR&amp;D expenses in 2020 were $5.9 billion primarily related to our acquisition of Forty Seven as well as collaborations and  other  investments  that  we  entered  into  during  the  year  with  Arcus,  Pionyr  Immunotherapeutics,  Inc.  ('Pionyr'),  Tango Therapeutics, Inc. ('Tango'), Tizona Therapeutics, Inc. ('Tizona') and Jounce Therapeutics, Inc. ('Jounce').\n\n## Strategy and Outlook 2022\n\nOur  purpose  is  to  deliver  life-changing  medications  to  patients  in  need  through  scientific  breakthroughs,  innovation  and strong operational execution. Our strategic ambitions are to (i) bring 10+ transformative therapies to patients by 2030; (ii) be the biotech employer and partner of choice; and (iii) deliver shareholder value in a sustainable and responsible manner. Our strategic priorities reflect how we will deliver those ambitions: (i) expand internal and external innovation; (ii) strengthen portfolio strategy and decision making; (iii) increase patient benefit and access; and (iv) continue to evolve our culture.",

RISK FACTORS\n\nIn evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the following discussion of material risks, events and uncertainties that make an investment in us speculative or risky in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

W e note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors; our operations could also be affected by factors, events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. Therefore, you should not consider the following risks to be a complete statement of all the potential risks or uncertainties that we face. Moreover, some of the factors, events and contingencies discussed below may have occurred in the past, but the disclosures below are not representations as to whether or not the factors, events or contingencies have occurred in the past, and instead reflect our beliefs and opinions as to the factors, events or contingencies that could materially and adversely affect us in the future.\n\n## Product and Commercialization Risks\n\n## Certain of our products subject us to additional or heightened risks.\n\n## HIV\n\nWe receive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales of our products for the treatment and prevention of HIV  infection. We may be unable to sustain or increase sales of our HIV  products for any number of reasons, including market share gains by competitive products, including generics, or the inability to introduce new HIV medications necessary to remain competitive. In such case, we may need to scale back our operations, including our future drug development and spending on research and development ('R&amp;D') efforts. For example, many of our HIV  products contain tenofovir alafenamide ('TAF'), which belongs to the nucleoside class of antiviral therapeutics. If there are any changes to the treatment or prevention paradigm for HIV , and nucleoside-based therapeutics do not remain the preferred regimen, our HIV product sales would be adversely impacted.\n\n## Cell Therapy\n\nAdvancing a novel and personalized therapy such as Y escarta or Tecartus, which are chimeric antigen receptor ('CAR') T-cell therapies, creates significant challenges, including:\n\n- educating and certifying medical personnel regarding the procedures and the potential side effects, such as cytokine release syndrome and neurologic toxicities, in compliance with the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ('FDA');\n- securing sufficient supply of other medications to manage side effects, such as tocilizumab and corticosteroids, which may not be available in sufficient quantities, may not adequately control the side effects and/or may have detrimental impacts on the efficacy of cell therapy;\n- developing and maintaining a robust and reliable process for engineering a patient's T cells in our facilities and infusing them back into the patient; and\n- conditioning patients with chemotherapy in advance of administering our therapy, which may increase the risk of adverse side effects.\n\nThe use of engineered T cells as a potential cancer treatment is a recent development and may not be broadly accepted by physicians, patients, hospitals, cancer treatment centers, payers and others in the medical community. For example, in January 2024, FDA instituted a class labeling change for all approved CAR Tcell therapies, including a 'boxed warning' about the possible risk of secondary T-cell malignancies in patients treated with CAR T-cell therapy. For challenges related to the reimbursement of Y escarta and Tecartus, see also ' Our existing products are subject to reimbursement pressures from government agencies and other third parties, required rebates and discounts, and other pricing pressures.'\n\nWe rely on third-party sites to collect patients' white blood cells, known as apheresis centers, as well as shippers, couriers, and hospitals for the logistical collection of patients' white blood cells and ultimate delivery of Y escarta and Tecartus to patients. These vendors may encounter disruptions or difficulties that could result in product loss and regulatory action. Apheresis centers may also choose not to participate in our quality certification process, or we may be unable to complete such certification in a timely manner or at all, which could delay or constrain our manufacturing and commercialization efforts.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Biktarvy was prominently positioned as a key revenue-generating product within Gilead\u2019s HIV portfolio, highlighted as a single-tablet regimen combining bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), emphasizing its convenience and efficacy. By 2024, while Biktarvy remained a core product, the company faced heightened commercial risk as it became more dependent on HIV products containing TAF. A shift in treatment paradigms or reduced preference for nucleoside-based therapies could significantly impact Biktarvy\u2019s sales and, by extension, Gilead\u2019s financial stability. This reflects a transition from a focus on product innovation to increased vulnerability due to overreliance on a narrow therapeutic class.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Biktarvy was described as a leading HIV treatment with a focus on its innovative, once-daily single-tablet regimen combining three antiretrovirals, including TAF.",
        "Step 2: By 2024, Gilead's risk disclosures indicated a strategic dependency on Biktarvy and other TAF-containing HIV products, exposing the company to market shifts away from nucleoside-based therapies.",
        "Step 3: The evolution reflects a shift from product-centric innovation to increased commercial risk tied to a single drug class, indicating a narrowing of strategic flexibility."

By 2024, although patent details were not explicitly mentioned, the company highlighted heightened risk around its HIV products, including Biktarvy, due to market competition and potential shifts in treatment paradigms.

          "chunk_text": "## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nIn evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the following discussion of material risks, events and uncertainties that make an investment in us speculative or risky in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A manifestation of any of the following risks and uncertainties could,  in  circumstances  we  may  or  may  not  be  able  to  accurately  predict,  materially  and  adversely  affect  our  business  and  operations,  growth,  reputation (including the commercial or scientific reputation of our products), prospects, product pipeline and sales, operating and financial results, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and stock price. W e note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors; our operations could also be affected by factors, events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. Therefore, you should not consider the following risks to be a complete statement of all the potential risks or uncertainties that we face. Moreover, some of the factors, events and contingencies discussed below may have occurred in the past, but the disclosures below are not representations as to whether or not the factors, events or contingencies have occurred in the past, and instead reflect our beliefs and opinions as to the factors, events or contingencies that could materially and adversely affect us in the future.\n\n## Product and Commercialization Risks\n\n## Certain of our products subject us to additional or heightened risks.\n\n## HIV\n\nWe receive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales of our products for the treatment and prevention of HIV  infection. We may be unable to sustain or increase sales of our HIV  products for any number of reasons, including market share gains by competitive products, including generics, or the inability to introduce new HIV medications necessary to remain competitive. In such case, we may need to scale back our operations, including our future drug development and spending on research and development ('R&amp;D') efforts. For example, many of our HIV  products contain tenofovir alafenamide ('TAF'), which belongs to the nucleoside class of antiviral therapeutics. If there are any changes to the treatment or prevention paradigm for HIV , and nucleoside-based therapeutics do not remain the preferred regimen, our HIV product sales would be adversely impacted.\n\n## Cell Therapy\n\nAdvancing a novel and personalized therapy such as Y escarta or Tecartus, which are chimeric antigen receptor ('CAR') T-cell therapies, creates significant challenges, including:\n\n- educating and certifying medical personnel regarding the procedures and the potential side effects, such as cytokine release syndrome and neurologic toxicities, in compliance with the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ('FDA');\n- securing sufficient supply of other medications to manage side effects, such as tocilizumab and corticosteroids, which may not be available in sufficient quantities, may not adequately control the side effects and/or may have detrimental impacts on the efficacy of cell therapy;\n- developing and maintaining a robust and reliable process for engineering a patient's T cells in our facilities and infusing them back into the patient; and\n- conditioning patients with chemotherapy in advance of administering our therapy, which may increase the risk of adverse side effects.\n\nThe use of engineered T cells as a potential cancer treatment is a recent development and may not be broadly accepted by physicians, patients, hospitals, cancer treatment centers, payers and others in the medical community. For example, in January 2024, FDA instituted a class labeling change for all approved CAR Tcell therapies, including a 'boxed warning' about the possible risk of secondary T-cell malignancies in patients treated with CAR T-cell therapy. For challenges related to the reimbursement of Y escarta and Tecartus, see also ' Our existing products are subject to reimbursement pressures from government agencies and other third parties, required rebates and discounts, and other pricing pressures.'\n\nWe rely on third-party sites to collect patients' white blood cells, known as apheresis centers, as well as shippers, couriers, and hospitals for the logistical collection of patients' white blood cells and ultimate delivery of Y escarta and Tecartus to patients. These vendors may encounter disruptions or difficulties that could result in product loss and regulatory action. Apheresis centers may also choose not to participate in our quality certification process, or we may be unable to complete such certification in a timely manner or at all, which could delay or constrain our manufacturing and commercialization efforts.",

      "question": "How did Johnson & Johnson's financial stake and ownership relationship with Kenvue evolve between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of retained equity and associated gains or losses?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Johnson & Johnson retained a 9.5% ownership stake in Kenvue valued at $4.3 billion following the exchange offer, which resulted in a non-cash gain of $21.0 billion, including a $2.8 billion gain on the retained shares. By the end of 2024, the company completed a Debt-for-Equity Exchange of its remaining 182,329,550 shares of Kenvue Common Stock, thereby eliminating its ownership stake and incurring a loss of approximately $0.4 billion in the process. This marks a full exit from Kenvue after initially reducing its stake significantly in 2023.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, Johnson & Johnson retained 9.5% of Kenvue valued at $4.3 billion after the exchange offer and recorded a $21.0 billion gain, including a $2.8 billion gain on retained shares.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the company completed a Debt-for-Equity Exchange of all remaining Kenvue shares, resulting in a $0.4 billion loss and ending its ownership stake entirely.",

A s of the closing of the IPO, Johnson &amp; Johnson owned approximately 89.6% of the total outstanding shares of Kenvue Common Stock and at July 2, 2023, the non-controlling interest of $1.3 billion associated with Kenvue was reflected in equity attributable to non-controlling interests in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nOn August 23, 2023, Johnson &amp; Johnson completed the disposition of an additional 80.1% ownership of Kenvue Common Stock through an exchange offer, which resulted in Johnson &amp; Johnson acquiring 190,955,436 shares of the Company's common stock in exchange for 1,533,830,450 shares of Kenvue Common Stock. The $31.4 billion of Johnson &amp; Johnson common stock received in the exchange offer is recorded in Treasury stock. Following the exchange offer, the Company owned 9.5% of the total outstanding shares of Kenvue Common Stock that was recorded in other assets within continuing operations at the fair market value of $4.3 billion as of A ugust 23, 2023 and $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2023.\n\nJohnson &amp; Johnson divested net assets of $11.6 billion as of A ugust 23, 2023, and the accumulated other comprehensive loss attributable to the Consumer Health business at that date was $4.3 billion. A dditionally, at the date of the exchange offer, Johnson &amp; Johnson decreased the non-controlling interest by $1.2 billion to record the deconsolidation of Kenvue. This resulted in a gain on the exchange offer of $21.0 billion that was recorded in Net earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes in the consolidated statements of earnings for the fiscal third quarter of 2023. This one-time gain includes a gain of $2.8 billion on the Kenvue Common Stock retained by Johnson &amp; Johnson. The gain on the exchange offer qualifies as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nOn May 15, 2024, the Company issued $3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of commercial paper and received $3.6 billion of net cash proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes. On M ay 17, 2024, the Company completed a Debt-for-Equity Exchange of its remaining 182,329,550 shares of Kenvue Common Stock for the outstanding Commercial Paper. Upon completion of the Debt-for-Equity Exchange, the Commercial Paper was satisfied and discharged and the Company no longer owns any shares of Kenvue Common Stock. This exchange resulted in a loss of approximately $0.4 billion recorded in Other (income) expense.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Company's material contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of December 29, 2024: To satisfy these obligations, the Company intends to use cash from operations.\n\n",

The 2023 data emphasized steady growth, particularly in the U.S. ($5,525 million, up 3.8%) and modest international growth ($3,417 million, up 4.6%). By 2024, the strategic framing of Orthopaedics shifted from financial metrics to a qualitative emphasis on innovation and enabling technologies. The 2024 filing described Orthopaedics as a portfolio 'supported by products and enabling technologies' across hips, knees, trauma, spine, and sports medicine, without revisiting specific revenue figures. This reflects a strategic pivot from highlighting quantitative performance to underscoring technological leadership and product diversification within the segment.",

M any of these medicines were developed in collaboration with strategic partners or are licensed from other companies and maintain active lifecy cle dev elopment programs.\n\n## MedTech\n\nThe MedTech segment includes a broad portfolio of products used in the cardiovascular, orthopaedics, surgery, and vision categories. The Cardiovascular (previously referred to as Interventional solutions) portfolio includes electrophysiology products to treat heart rhythm disorders, the heart recovery portfolio (Abiomed) which includes technologies to treat severe coronary artery disease requiring high-risk PCI or A M I cardiogenic shock, circulatory restoration products (Shockwave) for the treatment of calcified coronary artery disease (CA D) and peripheral artery disease (PA D), and neurovascular care that treats hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke. The Orthopaedics portfolio includes products and enabling technologies that support hips, knees, trauma, spine, sports, and others. The Surgery portfolios include advanced and general surgery technologies, as well as solutions that focus on breast aesthetics and reconstruction (M entor). V ision products include ACUVUE brand contact lenses and TECNIS intraocular lenses for cataract surgery. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals, and retailers and are used predominantly in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals, and clinics.\n\n## Geographic areas\n\nThe Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being. The products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under Segments of Business - Innovative M edicine and M edTech. However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in the international business include those developed in the U.S. and by subsidiaries abroad.\n\nInvestments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties.\n\n## Raw materials\n\nRaw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where there are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company.\n\n## Patents\n\nThe Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible. They own, or are licensed under, a significant number of patents in the U.S. and other countries relating to their products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. The Company's subsidiaries face patent challenges from third parties, including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products.

      "question": "How did Johnson & Johnson's financial stake and strategic relationship with Kenvue evolve from 2023 to 2024, particularly regarding the retention and subsequent disposal of Kenvue shares?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Johnson & Johnson retained a 9.5% stake in Kenvue valued at $4.3 billion after completing the exchange offer in August. This stake was recorded in other assets and experienced a $0.4 billion expense by year-end due to subsequent changes. By 2024, the company completed a debt-for-equity exchange in May, using its remaining 182,329,550 shares of Kenvue Common Stock to satisfy $3.6 billion of commercial paper. This resulted in a $0.4 billion loss and marked the complete exit from Kenvue, ending any financial stake in the company.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, Johnson & Johnson retained a 9.5% stake in Kenvue valued at $4.3 billion after the exchange offer, with a $0.4 billion expense recorded by year-end.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, Johnson & Johnson completed a debt-for-equity exchange of its remaining Kenvue shares to satisfy $3.6 billion in commercial paper, resulting in a $0.4 billion loss and full divestiture.",
        "Step 3: The relationship evolved from a strategic partial divestiture with ongoing stake in 2023 to a complete exit in 2024, marking a transformation in the nature of the relationship from stakeholder to no ownership."

A debt-for-equity exchange was com pleted in the fiscal second quarter of 2024.\n\nOn May 15, 2024, the Company issued $3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of commercial paper and received $3.6 billion of net cash proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes. On M ay 17, 2024, the Company completed a Debt-for-Equity Exchange of its remaining 182,329,550 shares of Kenvue Common Stock for the outstanding Commercial Paper. Upon completion of the Debt-for-Equity Exchange, the Commercial Paper was satisfied and discharged, and the Company no longer owns any shares of Kenvue Common Stock. This exchange resulted in a loss of approximately $0.4 billion recorded in Other (income) expense.\n\nFor the fiscal y ears ended December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023 for equity investments without readily determinable market values, $171 million and $1 million, respectively, of the changes in fair value reflected in net income were the result of impairments. There were impacts of $26 million and $27 million, respectively, of changes in the fair value reflected in net income due to changes in observable prices and gains on the disposal of investments.\n\nFair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability . Fair v alue is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. In accordance with A SC 820, a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest.\n\nThe fair value of a derivativ e financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign ex change contracts, interest rate contracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the prevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange rate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the amounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds equity investments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The Company holds acquisition related contingent liabilities based upon certain regulatory and commercial events, which are classified as Level 3, whose values are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimations.\n\nThe following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:\n\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\n\nLevel 2 - Significant other observable inputs.\n\nLevel 3 - Significant unobservable inputs.\n\n2024 Annual Report\n\n63",

      "question": "How has Johnson & Johnson's approach to privacy compliance programs evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in response to new privacy laws and international data flow regulations?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Johnson & Johnson had established privacy compliance programs and controls that its global businesses were required to follow, with an emphasis on addressing new privacy laws expected in 'other territories' and increasing enforcement by governmental authorities, especially concerning data localization and international data flows. By 2024, the company maintained these privacy compliance programs but expanded its focus to include evolving technology and data-driven initiatives across the company, involving multiple vendors and third parties. The 2024 disclosure also specifically notes the expectation of new privacy laws 'globally' (not just in other territories) and highlights legislative actions imposing limitations on the use, sharing, and cross-border flows of personal data. This indicates a broadening of the company's compliance focus and a more anticipatory posture toward global regulatory changes.",

      "question": "How has the strategic relationship between LLY and Boehringer Ingelheim evolved from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of legal involvement and collaborative dependency on the Jardiance product?",
      "answer": "In 2022, LLY was not a direct party to the Jardiance patent litigation initiated by Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) against generic drug manufacturers under the Hatch-Waxman Act, indicating a more arms-length relationship in legal matters. By 2024, LLY's business became significantly dependent on the Jardiance collaboration, as the product was selected under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) for government-set pricing with a 66% discount compared to the 2023 list price, directly impacting LLY's revenue projections and business strategy. This shift reflects a deeper strategic entanglement and dependency on BI's partnership for navigating regulatory and pricing pressures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, BI initiated Jardiance patent litigation independently, and LLY was not a party to the legal proceedings, indicating limited legal interdependence.",
        "Step 2: By 2024, Jardiance\u2014part of the LLY-BI collaboration\u2014was selected under the IRA for a 66% price discount, directly affecting LLY\u2019s revenue and strategic planning, signaling a shift to a dependency model.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects an evolution from a partner-with relationship with limited legal overlap to a depends-on relationship where LLY's financial outcomes are now materially tied to the joint product and its regulatory challenges."

          "chunk_text": "## Jardiance Patent Litigation\n\nIn November 2018, Boehringer Ingelheim (BI), our partner in marketing and development of Jardiance, initiated U.S. patent litigation in the U.S. District Court of Delaware alleging infringement arising from submissions of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDA) by a number of generic companies seeking approval to market generic versions of Jardiance, Glyxambi, and Synjardy in accordance with the procedures set out in the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the Hatch-Waxman Act). Particularly with respect to Jardiance, the generic companies' ANDAs seek approval to market generic versions of Jardiance prior to the expiration of the relevant patents, and allege that certain patents, including in some allegations the compound patent, are invalid or would not be infringed. We are not a party to this litigation. This litigation has been stayed.\n\n## Taltz Patent Litigation\n\nIn April 2021, we petitioned the High Court of Ireland to declare invalid the patent that Novartis Pharma AG (Novartis) purchased from Genentech, Inc. in 2020. Novartis responded by filing a claim against us alleging patent infringement related to our commercialization of Taltz and seeking damages for past infringement and an injunction against future infringement. This matter is ongoing.\n\nIn April 2021 and November 2021, Novartis petitioned the Court of Rome Intellectual Property Division and the Swiss Federal Patent Court, respectively, in preliminary injunction (PI) and main infringement proceedings against us related to our commercialization of Taltz. In June 2021, the Court of Rome Intellectual Property Division dismissed Novartis' PI action. Novartis appealed the ruling and in October 2021, the panel hearing Novartis' appeal appointed a technical expert to assess the merits of the case. Both matters are ongoing. Hearings on the Italian and Swiss PI requests are scheduled for May 2022.\n\nIn June 2021, Novartis petitioned the Commercial Court of Vienna in PI proceedings and in November 2021, the Austrian court denied Novartis' request. Novartis did not appeal the ruling, and this matter is now closed.\n\n## Zyprexa Canada Patent Litigation\n\nBeginning in the mid-2000s, several generic companies in Canada challenged the validity of our Zyprexa compound patent. In 2012, the Canadian Federal Court of Appeals denied our appeal of a lower court's decision that certain patent claims were invalid for lack of utility. In 2013, Apotex Inc. and Apotex Pharmachem Inc. (collectively, Apotex) brought claims against us in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice at Toronto for damages related to our enforcement of the Zyprexa compound patent under Canadian regulations governing patented drugs. Apotex seeks compensation based on novel legal theories under the Statute of Monopolies, Trade-Mark Act, and common law. In March 2021, the Ontario Superior Court granted our motion for summary judgement, thereby dismissing Apotex's case. Apotex appealed that ruling to the Court of Appeal for Ontario in April 2021 and a hearing occurred February 2022. We await a decision.\n\n## Product Liability Litigation\n\n## Actos\u00ae Product Liability\n\nWe are named along with Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd. and Takeda affiliates (collectively, Takeda) as a defendant in four purported product liability class actions in Canada related to Actos, which we commercialized with Takeda in Canada until 2009, including one in Ontario filed December 2011 ( Casseres et al. v. Takeda Pharmaceutical North America, Inc., et al. ), one in Quebec filed July 2012 ( Whyte et al. v. Eli Lilly et al. ), one in Saskatchewan filed November 2017 ( Weiler v. Takeda Canada Inc. et al. ), and one in Alberta filed January 2013 ( Epp v. Takeda Canada Inc. et al. ). In general, plaintiffs in these actions alleged that Actos caused or contributed to their bladder cancer. An agreement to settle these actions became effective in May 2021. The relevant courts approved the settlement and the deadline for class members to seek settlement funds has now expired. The lawsuits have been dismissed or discontinued.\n\n102",

In 2022, the U.S. gov ernment enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). Among other measures, the IRA requires the U.S. Department of Health and Human Serv ices (HHS) to effectiv ely set prices for certain single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D. Generally, these gov ernment prices apply beginning at nine years (for medicines approv ed under a New Drug Application) or thirteen years (for medicines approv ed under a Biologics License Application) following FDA approv al or licensure for the molecule and are set at a price that generally represents a significant discount from existing prices to wholesalers and direct purchasers. While the law specifies a maximum price that HHS can set, it does not set a minimum price. The Medicare price HHS determines may impact the product's best price determination under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and the 340B Drug Pricing Program, potentially leading to a negativ e impact on both Medicaid and 340B prices. In August 2023, HHS selected Jardiance, which is part of our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, as one of the first ten medicines subject to gov ernment-set prices effectiv e in 2026. In August 2024, HHS announced the government-set prices for these medicines with Jardiance subject to a 66% discount compared to the 2023 U.S. calendar year list price for a 30-day supply and discounts for the other nine medicines ranging from approximately 38% to 79% below list price. Giv en our product portfolio, we expect additional significant products will be selected in future years, which would hav e the effect of accelerating rev enue erosion prior to expiry of exclusiv ities. The effect of reducing prices and reimbursement for certain of our products could significantly impact our business and consolidated results of operations.\n\nOther IRA prov isions require drug manufacturers to prov ide rebates for Medicare Part B and Part D medicines under certain circumstances. Also, on January 1, 2025, the Part D benefit redesign replaced the Part D Cov erage Gap Discount Program with a new manufacturer discount program. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to v arious penalties, including civ il monetary penalties, which could be significant.\n\nThe IRA has, and will continue to, meaningfully influence our business strategies and those of our competitors. In particular, the nine-year timeline to set prices for medicines approv ed under a New Drug Application reduces the attractiv eness of inv estment in small molecule innov ation.

We also educate healthcare providers about our products in various other ways, including promoting in online health care channels, distributing literature and samples of certain products to physicians, and exhibiting at medical meetings. In addition, we advertise certain products directly to consumers in the U.S., and we maintain websites and other media channels with information about our major products. We supplement our employee sales force with contract sales organizations to leverage our resources and reach additional patients in need.\n\nWe maintain special business groups to service wholesalers, pharmacy benefit managers, managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations, government and long-term care institutions, hospitals, and certain retail pharmacies. We enter into arrangements with these organizations providing for discounts or rebates on our products.\n\nIn the U.S., most of our products are distributed through wholesalers that serve pharmacies, physicians and other health care professionals, and hospitals. In 2021, 2020, and 2019, three wholesale distributors in the U.S.-McKesson Corporation, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, and Cardinal Health, Inc.-each accounted for between 15 percent and 20 percent of our consolidated revenue. No other customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our consolidated revenue in any of these years.\n\n## Outside the U.S.\n\nOutside the U.S., we promote our products to healthcare providers primarily through sales representatives and other health care channels. While the products we market vary from country to country, diabetes products constitute the largest single group of our consolidated revenue. Distribution patterns for our products also vary from country to country. In most countries in which we operate, we maintain our own sales organizations, but in some smaller countries we market our products through third-party distributors, some of which we have engaged through distribution and promotion arrangements.\n\n## Marketing Collaborations\n\nCertain of our products are marketed in arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies. For example, we and Boehringer Ingelheim have a global agreement to develop and commercialize a portfolio of diabetes products, including Trajenta, Jentadueto , Jardiance, Glyxambi , Synjardy , Trijardy XR, and Basaglar. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\nFor additional information, see Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4, Collaborations and Other Arrangements.\"\n\n## Competition\n\nOur products compete globally with many other pharmaceutical products in highly competitive markets.\n\nImportant competitive factors include effectiveness, safety, and ease of use; formulary placement, price, and demonstrated cost-effectiveness; marketing effectiveness; and research and development of new products, processes, modalities, and uses. Most new products that we introduce must compete with other branded, biosimilar, or generic products already on the market or that are later developed by competitors. When competitors introduce new products or delivery systems with therapeutic or cost advantages, including by developing new modalities, our products become subject to decreased sales, progressive price reductions, or both.\n\nWe believe our long-term competitive success depends on discovering and developing (either alone or in collaboration with others) or acquiring innovative, cost-effective products that provide improved outcomes for patients and deliver value to payers, and continuously improving the productivity of our operations in a highly competitive environment.

Barriers to reimbursable patient access in some cases include default payer cov erage restrictions for our medicines.

In most major jurisdictions, the regulatory approv al process for pharmaceuticals (other than biological products (biologics)) exempts generics from costly and time-consuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy, allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy of the innov ator product. As a result, generic manufacturers generally inv est far fewer resources than we do for our branded products in research and dev elopment and can price their products significantly lower than our branded products. Accordingly, when a branded non-biologic pharmaceutical loses its market exclusiv ity, it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product, which can result in the loss of a significant portion of the branded product's rev enue in a v ery short period of time. Moreov er, gov ernments in some countries lev erage generic entrants to driv e price concessions through the utilization of v olume-based procurement bidding and other measures.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Jardiance revenue was growing significantly, with a 30% increase in the U.S. and 28% outside the U.S., driven by increased demand and volume respectively. By 2024, the collaboration was significantly impacted by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which introduced government-set pricing for certain drugs, including Jardiance. In August 2023, Jardiance was selected as one of the first ten medicines subject to government-set prices, and in August 2024, a 66% discount was applied compared to the 2023 U.S. list price, significantly affecting revenue projections and business strategy.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, Jardiance was experiencing strong revenue growth in both the U.S. and international markets.",

          "chunk_text": "Revenue of COVID-19 antibodies, treatments for mild to moderate COVID-19 for higher-risk patients and for postexposure prophylaxis in certain individuals for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection, was $1.98 billion in the U.S. during the year ended December 31, 2021. Revenue outside the U.S. was $261.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. The availability of superior or competitive therapies, including therapies that can be administered more easily, or preventative measures, such as vaccines, coupled with the unpredictable nature of pandemics, have and could further negatively impact or eliminate demand for these COVID-19 antibodies. The FDA has revised, and may in the future revise, any EUA for our COVID-19 antibodies in response to the prevalence of variants against which our antibodies have varying degrees of efficacy. We expect that additional revenue from the sale of bamlanivimab and etesevimab after the first quarter of 2022 will be limited.\n\nRevenue of Taltz, a treatment for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, active psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, increased 20 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand, partially offset by lower realized prices due to increased rebates to gain commercial access. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 34 percent, primarily driven by increased volume.\n\nRevenue of Alimta, a treatment for various cancers, decreased 2 percent in the U.S., driven by decreased volume, partially offset by higher realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 22 percent, primarily driven by decreased volume due to the entry of generic competition in certain markets and, to a lesser extent, lower realized prices, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Following the loss of exclusivity in major European countries and Japan in June 2021, we faced, and remain exposed to, generic competition which has eroded revenue and is likely to continue to rapidly and severely erode revenue from current levels. In the U.S., we expect the limited entry of generic competition starting February 2022 and subsequent unlimited entry starting April 2022. We expect that the entry of generic competition following the loss of exclusivity in the U.S. will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue. See \"Executive Overview - Other Matters- Patent Matters\" for additional information.\n\nRevenue of Jardiance, a treatment for type 2 diabetes, to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in adult patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease, and to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, increased 30 percent in the U.S., primarily driven by increased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 28 percent, primarily driven by increased volume. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim involving Jardiance.\n\nRevenue of Verzenio, a treatment for HR+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer and high risk early breast cancer, increased 35 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 75 percent, driven by increased volume.\n\nRevenue of Humulin, an injectable human insulin for the treatment of diabetes, decreased 4 percent in the U.S., driven by decreased demand and, to a lesser extent, lower realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 1 percent, driven by decreased volume, largely offset by higher realized prices and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.\n\nRevenue of Olumiant, a treatment for adults with moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis, moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, and of baricitinib, a treatment, with or without remdesivir, of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, increased $260.3 million in the U.S., driven by increased volume and, to a lesser extent, higher realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 38 percent, driven by increased volume and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower realized prices. Increased volume worldwide was partially driven by utilization of Olumiant for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.\n\nRevenue of Cyramza, a treatment for various cancers, decreased 6 percent in the U.S., driven by decreased demand, partially offset by higher realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 4 percent, driven by increased volume, partially offset by lower realized prices.",

          "chunk_text": "## Trends Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access and Certain Other Regulatory Developments\n\nReforms, including those that may stem from political initiativ es, periods of unev en economic growth or downturns, or as a result of inflation or deflation, the emergence or escalation of, and responses to, international tension and conflicts, or gov ernment budgeting priorities, are expected to continue to result in added pressure on pricing and reimbursement for our products.\n\nGlobal concern ov er access to, and affordability of, pharmaceutical products continues to driv e regulatory and legislativ e debate and action, as well as cost containment efforts by gov ernmental authorities. Such measures include the use of mandated discounts, price reporting requirements, mandated reference prices, restrictiv e formularies, changes to av ailable intellectual property protections, as well as other efforts. In 2022, the U.S. gov ernment enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). Among other measures, the IRA requires the U.S. Department of Health and Human Serv ices (HHS) to effectiv ely set prices for certain single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D. Generally, these gov ernment prices apply beginning at nine years (for medicines approv ed under a New Drug Application) or thirteen years (for medicines approv ed under a Biologics License Application) following FDA approv al or licensure for the molecule and are set at a price that generally represents a significant discount from existing prices to wholesalers and direct purchasers. While the law specifies a maximum price that HHS can set, it does not set a minimum price. The Medicare price HHS determines may impact the product's best price determination under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and the 340B Drug Pricing Program, potentially leading to a negativ e impact on both Medicaid and 340B prices. In August 2023, HHS selected Jardiance, which is part of our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, as one of the first ten medicines subject to gov ernment-set prices effectiv e in 2026. In August 2024, HHS announced the government-set prices for these medicines with Jardiance subject to a 66% discount compared to the 2023 U.S. calendar year list price for a 30-day supply and discounts for the other nine medicines ranging from approximately 38% to 79% below list price. Giv en our product portfolio, we expect additional significant products will be selected in future years, which would hav e the effect of accelerating rev enue erosion prior to expiry of exclusiv ities. The effect of reducing prices and reimbursement for certain of our products could significantly impact our business and consolidated results of operations.\n\nOther IRA prov isions require drug manufacturers to prov ide rebates for Medicare Part B and Part D medicines under certain circumstances. Also, on January 1, 2025, the Part D benefit redesign replaced the Part D Cov erage Gap Discount Program with a new manufacturer discount program. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to v arious penalties, including civ il monetary penalties, which could be significant.\n\nThe IRA has, and will continue to, meaningfully influence our business strategies and those of our competitors. In particular, the nine-year timeline to set prices for medicines approv ed under a New Drug Application reduces the attractiv eness of inv estment in small molecule innov ation. The IRA can cause changes to dev elopment approach and timing and inv estments at-risk. The full impact of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry, including the implications to us of a competitor's product being selected for price setting, remains uncertain.\n\nAdditional policies, regulations, legislation, or enforcement, including those proposed or pursued by lawmakers, regulators, and other authorities in the U.S. and worldwide, could adv ersely impact our business and consolidated results of operations. For example, the U.S. House of Representativ es recently passed the BIOSECURE Act, which is under consideration in the U.S. Senate. This legislation, if passed, could affect elements of the pharmaceutical supply chain; although as currently drafted we do not anticipate the bill would hav e a material impact on our business.",

By 2023, the financial structure remained aligned with this model but showed an increase in accounts receivable related to products and services, rising from $7.1 billion in 2022 to $8.6 billion in 2023.

      "question": "How did UnitedHealth Group's approach to Medicaid managed care contract bidding evolve between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of assumptions and risks associated with bid accuracy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group emphasized the risk of losing Medicaid members if it failed to renew state Medicaid managed care contracts, highlighting the importance of contract renewals to retain enrolled members. By 2023, the company placed greater emphasis on the assumptions behind its bids, noting that if these assumptions\u2014such as enrollment, utilization, and medical costs\u2014were materially incorrect due to unforeseen program changes or competitor pricing, it could materially affect results of operations and cash flows. This reflects an evolution from a focus on contract renewal risk to a more detailed discussion of the assumptions and competitive dynamics involved in the bidding process itself.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, the primary concern was the risk of not obtaining renewals of state Medicaid managed care contracts, which could lead to loss of enrolled members.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the focus shifted to the foundational assumptions used in the bidding process, including enrollment projections and cost estimates, and how inaccuracies could materially affect financial outcomes.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a more nuanced discussion of bid accuracy and competitive pressures in 2023 compared to the earlier emphasis on contract renewal risk in 2022."

Negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various markets.\n\nAs a result of our participation in various government health care programs, both as a payer and as a service provider to payers, we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding, enrollments, payment adjustments, audits and government investigations which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nWe participate in various federal, state and local government health care benefit programs, including as a payer in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, various Medicaid programs and CHIP, and receive substantial revenues from these programs. Certain of our Optum businesses also provide services to payers participating in government health care programs. A reduction or less than expected increase, or a protracted delay, in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies, or termination of the contract at the option of the government, may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nThe government health care programs in which we participate generally are subject to frequent changes, including changes which may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage, reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, reduce our participation in certain service areas or markets, or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs. Revenues for these programs depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms. Funding for these government programs depends on many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level. For example, CMS has in the past reduced or frozen Medicare Advantage benchmarks, and additional cuts to Medicare Advantage benchmarks are possible. In addition, from time to time, CMS makes changes to the way it calculates Medicare Advantage risk adjustment payments. Although we have adjusted members' benefits and premiums on a selective basis, ceased to offer benefit plans in certain counties, and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to the benchmark reductions and other funding pressures, these or other strategies may not fully address the funding pressures in the Medicare Advantage program. In addition, payers in the Medicare Advantage program may be subject to reductions in payments from CMS as a result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit. States have also made changes in rates and reimbursements for Medicaid members and audits can result in unexpected recoupments.\n\nUnder the Medicaid managed care program, state Medicaid agencies seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care Medicaid health programs. If we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state Medicaid managed care contracts, we risk losing the members who were enrolled in those Medicaid plans. Under the Medicare Part D program, to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members, our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark, which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted. If the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark, we risk losing the members who were auto-assigned to us and will not have additional members auto-assigned to us. In general, our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, medical costs and other factors. If any of these assumptions is materially incorrect, either as a result of unforeseen changes to the programs on which we bid, implementation of material program or policy changes after our bid submission, or submission by our competitors at lower rates than our bids, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nMany of the government health care coverage programs in which we participate are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance standards or benchmarks. For example, as part of the ACA, CMS has a system providing various quality bonus payments to Medicare Advantage plans meeting certain quality star ratings at the individual plan or local contract level. The star rating system considers various measures adopted by CMS, including, among others, quality of care, preventive services, chronic illness management, handling of appeals and customer satisfaction. Plans must have a rating of four stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments. If we do not maintain or continue to improve our star ratings, our plans may not be eligible for quality bonuses and we may experience a negative impact on our revenues and the benefits our plans can offer, which could materially and adversely affect the marketability of our plans, our membership levels, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Any changes in standards or care delivery models applying to government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or our inability to improve our quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.",

In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward-looking statements about future results. Any or all forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong. Our forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining our future results. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict or quantify.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\n\nWe are subject to risks associated with public health crises, large-scale medical emergencies and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and financial performance.\n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact health systems, businesses, governments and customer and consumer activities. The future impact to our business is primarily dependent upon the ultimate pacing, intensity and duration of the crisis, the severity of new variants of the COVID-19 virus, and the effectiveness and extent of administration of vaccinations and treatments, factors which remain uncertain at this time. These factors continue to affect the related treatment, testing, coverage and other services we provide for the people we serve. We may experience an increase in medical care costs as people seek care which was deferred during the pandemic and individuals with chronic conditions may require additional care needs resulting from missed treatments. The premiums and fees we charge, including premiums dependent upon documented health conditions, may not be sufficient to cover the medical and administrative costs associated with COVID-19 and other care services. Similarly, state and federal mandates for coverage may result in additional incurred expenses that are not associated with increases in government reimbursement (such as requirements for insurers to cover at-home COVID-19 testing).We have experienced and may continue to experience reduced demand for certain services Optum provides to care providers, health plans and employers as a result of reduced clinical and claims activity and changes in business priorities resulting from COVID-19. In addition, our care delivery business may continue to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 infections and exposures affecting providers we employ, resulting in reduced capacity to handle demand for care and related partial or full closures of our facilities. Our non-clinical workforce may also be adversely impacted by COVID-19 infections and exposures impacting our business operations.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in some of our customers having to temporarily or permanently close or severely curtail their operations, and unfavorable economic conditions resulting from the pandemic may continue to impact our clients, customers, health care providers, third party vendors and federal and state entities and programs. Among other impacts, we have experienced and may continue to experience loss of commercial and pharmacy care services members due to customer reductions in workforce and an adverse impact on the timing and collectability of premium payments. In addition, governments have modified, and may continue to modify, regulatory standards around various aspects of health care in response to COVID-19, which may adversely affect our ability to ensure timely compliance and meet various contractual obligations.\n\nFurther disruptions in public and private infrastructure, including supply chains providing medical supplies and pharmaceutical products, could disrupt our business operations or increase our operating costs. Additionally, the enactment of emergency powers by governments could disrupt our business operations, including by restricting pharmaceuticals or other supplies, and could increase the risk of shortages of necessary items.\n\nAlthough we cannot predict the pacing, intensity and duration of COVID-19, the pandemic's disruption to business activities, employment and economic effects, and near and long-term impacts on the patterns of care and services across the healthcare system could continue to have material and adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\n\nIf we fail to estimate, price for and manage our medical costs or set benefit designs in an effective manner, the profitability of our risk-based products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nThrough our risk-based benefit products, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. We generally use approximately 80% to 85% of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers. The profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict, price for and effectively manage medical costs. Our Optum Health business negotiates value-based arrangements with commercial third-party payers which are also included in premium revenues. Under a typical arrangement, Optum Health receives a fixed percentage of a third-party payer's premiums to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs provided to members. Premium revenues from risk-based products comprise nearly 80% of our total consolidated revenues. If we fail to predict accurately, or effectively price for or manage, the costs of providing care under risk-based arrangements, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.",

The allowance for credit losses was not material. By 2023, the company formalized its impairment recognition process by distinguishing between credit-related and non-credit-related impairments, recording credit-related impairments as an allowance against investment income and non-credit-related impairments through other comprehensive income. Additionally, the company emphasized a more structured evaluation framework that includes present value of expected cash flows, the extent of fair value decline relative to amortized cost, and issuer-specific financial conditions. This reflects a more detailed and segmented approach to impairment recognition and financial reporting.",

The Company believes it will collect the timely principal and interest due on its debt securities having an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities which impacted the Company's assessment on collectability of principal and interest. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates available-for-sale debt securities for any credit-related impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the expected cash flows, the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers noting no significant credit deterioration since purchase. As of December 31, 2021, the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary. The allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was not material.\n\n## 4.    Fair Value\n\nCertain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

      "answer": "In the 2022 10-K filing, Jevity was listed first among enteral feeding products, followed by Glucerna 1.2 Cal, Glucerna 1.5 Cal, Osmolite\u00ae, Oxepa\u00ae, Freego\u2122 (Enteral Pump), and Freego\u2122 sets. In the 2023 filing, Jevity remained listed first, but the Freego\u2122 (Enteral Pump) and Freego\u2122 sets were now mentioned immediately after Jevity, before the Glucerna and Osmolite\u00ae product lines. This change in listing order suggests a shift in product emphasis within the enteral feeding category, with Freego\u2122 products receiving more prominent placement alongside Jevity in 2023 compared to 2022.",

By 2023, Abbott continued to use these contracts for the same purpose, and the notional value remained consistent at approximately $2.2 billion. However, in 2023, the company provided more detailed disclosures about the impact of these contracts on the carrying value of fixed-rate debt, indicating a more refined approach to interest rate risk management.",

      "answer": "In 2022, as of December 31, 2021, an aggregate of 10,638,639 common shares were available for future issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. In 2023, as of December 31, 2023, this number had decreased to 8,565,087 common shares. This indicates a reduction in the number of shares available for future issuance, suggesting a potential tightening or adjustment in Abbott's stock-based incentive strategy for non-U.S. employees.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 (2022) \u2014 The 2022 filing reported 10,638,639 common shares available for future issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan as of December 31, 2021.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 (2023) \u2014 The 2023 filing reported a decrease to 8,565,087 common shares available for future issuance under the same plan as of December 31, 2023.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change \u2014 The number of shares available for future issuance under the plan decreased significantly from 2022 to 2023, indicating a change in Abbott\u2019s stock-based incentive strategy for non-U.S. employees."

          "chunk_text": "- In  April  2017,  the  2009  Program  was  replaced  by  the  2017  Program.  No  further  awards  will  be granted under the 2009 Program.\n- (ii) Abbott Laboratories 2017 Incentive Stock Program .  Benefits  under  the  2017  Program  include  nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards, other share-based awards (including stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalents and recognition awards), awards to non-employee directors, and foreign benefits. The shares that remain available for issuance under the 2017  Program  may  be  issued  in  connection  with  any  one  of  these  benefits  and  may  be  either authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares (except that restricted stock awards are satisfied from treasury shares).\n- If there is a lapse, expiration, termination, forfeiture or cancellation of any benefit granted under the 2017 Program without the issuance of shares or payment of cash thereunder, the shares subject to or reserved for that benefit, or so reacquired, may again be used for new stock options, rights, or awards of any type authorized under the 2017 Program. If shares are issued under any benefit under the 2017 Program and thereafter are reacquired by Abbott pursuant to rights reserved upon their issuance, or pursuant  to  the  payment  of  the  purchase  price  of  shares  under  stock  options  by  delivery  of  other common shares of Abbott, the shares subject to or reserved for that benefit, or so reacquired, may not again be used for new stock options, rights, or awards of any type authorized under the 2017 Program.\n- (iii) Abbott Laboratories Employee Stock Purchase Plan for Non-U.S. Employees .  Eligible employees of participating  non-U.S.  affiliates  of  Abbott  may  participate  in  this  plan.  An  eligible  employee  may authorize payroll deductions at the rate of 1% to 10% of eligible compensation (in multiples of one percent) subject to a limit of US $12,500 during any purchase cycle.\n- Purchase cycles are generally six months long and usually begin on August 1 and February 1. On the last  day  of  each  purchase  cycle,  Abbott  uses  participant  contributions  to  acquire  Abbott  common shares. The shares may be either authorized but unissued shares, treasury shares, or shares acquired on the  open  market.  The  purchase  price  is  typically  85%  of  the  lower  of  the  fair  market  value  of  the shares on the purchase date or on the first day of that purchase cycle. As the number of shares subject to  outstanding  options  is  indeterminable,  columns  (a)  and  (b)  of  the  above  table  do  not  include information  on  the  Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan.  As  of  December  31,  2021,  an  aggregate  of 10,638,639  common shares were available  for  future  issuance  under  the  Employee  Stock  Purchase Plan, including shares subject to purchase during the current purchase cycle.\n\nIn April 2017, the 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for Non-U.S. Employees was amended and restated as the Abbott Laboratories 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for Non-U.S. Employees.\n\n- (2) Not included in the table: St. Jude Medical, Inc. Plans . In 2017, in connection with the acquisition of St. Jude Medical, Inc., options outstanding under the St. Jude Medical, Inc. 2007 Stock Incentive Plan, as  Amended  and  Restated  (2014)  were  assumed  by  Abbott  and  converted  into  Abbott  options  of substantially equivalent value. As of December 31, 2021, 589,916 options remained outstanding under these plans. These options have a weighted average purchase price of $30.61. No further awards will be granted under these plans.\n\nFor additional information concerning the Abbott Laboratories 2009 Incentive Stock Program, the Abbott Laboratories 2017  Incentive  Stock  Program,  and  the  Abbott  Laboratories  2017  Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan  for  Non-U.S. Employees, see the discussion in Note 8 entitled 'Incentive Stock Program' of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\n- (b) Information Concerning Security Ownership .  Incorporated herein by reference is the material under the heading 'Security Ownership of Executive Officers and Directors' and 'Information Concerning Security Ownership' in the 2022 Proxy Statement. The 2022 Proxy Statement will be filed on or about March 18, 2022.\n\n## ITEM 13.

      "question": "How has Abbott's positioning of Osmolite within its Nutritional Products segment evolved between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of its enteral feeding portfolio and associated product line strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Osmolite was listed among Abbott's enteral feeding products used in healthcare institutions, alongside Jevity\u00ae, Glucerna\u00ae 1.2 Cal, Glucerna\u00ae 1.5 Cal, Oxepa\u00ae, Freego\u2122, Nepro\u00ae, and Vital\u00ae. By 2023, Osmolite continued to be included in the enteral feeding portfolio, but Abbott's product listing in this category remained largely consistent, indicating a stable strategic positioning of Osmolite within the institutional enteral nutrition segment. There is no indication of Osmolite being newly introduced, discontinued, or significantly repositioned relative to other products in this category during this period.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Osmolite was explicitly listed among Abbott's enteral feeding products used in healthcare institutions, indicating its active role in the institutional nutrition strategy.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, Osmolite remained listed in the enteral feeding category alongside the same set of products, showing no addition, removal, or reclassification of Osmolite within the portfolio.",
        "Step 3: The unchanged listing of Osmolite in both years suggests that Abbott maintained a consistent strategic positioning of the product within its enteral feeding offerings for healthcare institutions."

The 4.1 percent decrease in 2020 International Pediatric Nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, was due to challenging market dynamics in the infant category in Greater China that more than offset growth across Abbott's pediatric products in various countries in Southeast Asia.

      "answer": "In 2023, Thermo Fisher invested $0.91 billion to acquire CorEvitas, LLC, a U.S.-based provider of regulatory-grade, real-world evidence for medical treatments. By 2024, this relationship had evolved from an investment into a full acquisition, as CorEvitas was integrated into the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment. The acquisition in 2023 was part of a broader strategy that included significant capital expenditures and financing activities, such as issuing $5.94 billion in senior notes and repurchasing $3.00 billion of company stock. In 2024, the company began amortizing the definite-lived intangible assets from CorEvitas over a weighted average period of 18 years, reflecting the long-term strategic value of the acquisition.",

      "answer": "In both 2023 and 2024, dividends paid by Medtronic were generally subject to Irish dividend withholding tax at a rate of 25 percent unless an exemption applied. For U.S. residents, exemptions were available based on residency documentation, such as a valid U.S. Certification of Residence (Form 6166) or Irish Non-Resident Form V2. In both years, a U.S. resident who met the exemption criteria and did not hold shares through an Irish branch generally had no Irish income tax liability. Additionally, if a U.S. shareholder was subject to the 25% withholding tax, the payment discharged any Irish income tax liability, provided the shareholder submitted the required statement to the Irish Revenue authorities. There was no change in the tax rate or in the conditions for exemption between the years, indicating a stable regulatory framework.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, the Irish dividend withholding tax rate was 25%, and U.S. shareholders could avoid this tax by meeting specific residency documentation requirements. Those who were subject to the withholding tax were discharged from Irish income tax liability upon payment.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the withholding tax rate remained at 25%, and the same exemptions and documentation requirements applied. The discharge of Irish income tax liability upon withholding tax payment was unchanged.",
        "Step 3: The treatment of Irish income tax liability for U.S. shareholders remained stable between 2023 and 2024, with no changes in tax rate, exemptions, or liability discharge mechanisms."

Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Shareholder Matters\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Irish Restrictions on Import and E xport of Capital\n\nExcept as indicated below, there are no restrictions on non-residents of Ireland dealing in Irish domestic securities, which includes ordinary shares of Irish companies. Except as indicated below, dividends and redemption proceeds also continue to be freely transferable to non-resident holders of such securities. The Financial Transfers Act, 1992 provides that the Irish Minister for Finance can make provision for the restriction of financial transfers between Ireland and other countries. For the purposes of this Act, 'financial transfers' include all transfers which would be movements of capital or payments within the meaning of the treaties governing the E.U. if they had been made between Member States of the E.U. To date, the Irish Minister for Finance has restricted financial transfers between Ireland and a number of third countries and the list is subject to on-going change.\n\nAny transfer of, or payment in respect of, a share or interest in a share involving the government of any country that is currently the subject of United Nations or E.U. sanctions, any person or body controlled by any of the foregoing, or by any person acting on behalf of the foregoing, may be subject to restrictions pursuant to such sanctions as implemented into Irish law.\n\n## Irish Taxes Applicable to U.S. Holders\n\nDividends paid by Medtronic will generally be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax (currently at a rate of 25 percent) unless an exemption applies.\n\nDividends paid to U.S. residents will not be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax provided that:\n\n- in the case of a beneficial owner of Medtronic shares held in the Depository Trust Company (DTC), the address of the beneficial owner in the records of his or her broker is in the United States and this information is provided by the broker to the Company's qualifying intermediary; or\n- in the case of a record owner, the record owner has provided to the Company's transfer agent a valid U.S. Certification of Residence (Form 6166) or valid Irish Non-Resident Form V2.\n\nIrish  income  tax   may  also  arise  with  respect  to  dividends  paid  on  Medtronic's  ordinary  shares. A  U.S.  resident  who  meets  one  of  the  ex emptions  from  dividend withholding tax described above and who does not hold Medtronic shares through a branch or agency in Ireland through which a trade is carried on generally will not have any Irish income tax liability on a dividend paid by Medtronic. In addition, if a U.S. shareholder is subject to the dividend withholding tax , the withholding payment discharges any Irish income tax liability, provided the shareholder furnishes to the Irish Revenue authorities a statement of the dividend withholding tax imposed.\n\nWhile the U.S./Ireland Double Tax Treaty contains provisions regarding withholding, due to the wide scope of the exemptions from dividend withholding tax available under Irish domestic law, it would generally be unnecessary for a U.S. resident shareholder to rely on the treaty provisions.\n\n## Item 6.

At April 26, 2024, no Euro Deferred Shares were issued or outstanding.\n\nPreferred  Shares The  authorized  share  capital  of  the  Company  includes 127.5  million  of  Preferred  Shares,  with  a  par  value  of  $0.20  per  share. At April  26,  2024, no Preferred Shares were issued or outstanding.\n\nA Preferred Shares The authorized share capital of the Company includes 500 thousand A Preferred Shares, with a par value of $1.00 per share. At April 26, 2024, no A Preferred Shares were outstanding.\n\nDividends The timing, declaration, and payment of future dividends to holders of the Company's ordinary shares falls within the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and depends upon many factors, including the statutory requirements of Irish law, the Company's earnings and financial condition, the capital requirements of the Company's businesses, industry practice and any other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant.\n\nOrdinary Share Repurchase Program Shares are repurchased on occasion to support the Company's stock-based compensation programs and to return capital to shareholders. During fiscal years 2024 and 2023, the Company repurchased approximately 25 million and 6 million shares, respectively, at an average price of $83.04 and $91.31, respectively.\n\nIn March 2019, the Company's Board of Directors authorized $6.0 billion for repurchase of the Company's ordinary shares. In March 2024, the Company's Board of Directors authorized an incremental $5.0 billion for share repurchases. There is no specific time-period associated with these repurchase authorizations. At April 26, 2024, the Company had used $5.7 billion of the $11.0 billion authorized under the repurchase program, leaving approximately $5.3 billion available for future repurchases. The Company accounts for repurchases of ordinary shares using the par value method and shares repurchased are cancelled.\n\n## 12. Stock Purchase and Award Plans\n\nIn fiscal year 2024, the Company granted stock awards under the 2021 Medtronic plc Long Term Incentive Plan (2021 Plan). The 2021 Plan provides for the grant of nonqualified and incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards, and other stock and cash-based awards. At April 26, 2024, there were approximately 88 million shares available for future grants under the 2021 Plan.",

        "Step 3: The removal of the phrase 'subject to ongoing/on-going change' reflects a subtle but meaningful evolution in the company's disclosure, potentially signaling regulatory stabilization or a strategic shift in emphasis."

Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Shareholder Matters\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Irish Restrictions on Import and E xport of Capital\n\nExcept as indicated below, there are no restrictions on non-residents of Ireland dealing in Irish domestic securities, which includes ordinary shares of Irish companies. Except as indicated below, dividends and redemption proceeds also continue to be freely transferable to non-resident holders of such securities. The Financial Transfers Act, 1992 provides that the Irish Minister for Finance can make provision for the restriction of financial transfers between Ireland and other countries. For the purposes of this Act, 'financial transfers' include all transfers which would be movements of capital or payments within the meaning of the treaties governing the E.U. if they had been made between Member States of the E.U. To date, the Irish Minister for Finance has restricted financial transfers between Ireland and a number of third countries and the list is subject to on-going change.\n\nAny transfer of, or payment in respect of, a share or interest in a share involving the government of any country that is currently the subject of United Nations or E.U. sanctions, any person or body controlled by any of the foregoing, or by any person acting on behalf of the foregoing, may be subject to restrictions pursuant to such sanctions as implemented into Irish law.\n\n## Irish Taxes Applicable to U.S. Holders\n\nDividends paid by Medtronic will generally be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax (currently at a rate of 25 percent) unless an exemption applies.\n\nDividends paid to U.S. residents will not be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax provided that:\n\n- in the case of a beneficial owner of Medtronic shares held in the Depository Trust Company (DTC), the address of the beneficial owner in the records of his or her broker is in the United States and this information is provided by the broker to the Company's qualifying intermediary; or\n- in the case of a record owner, the record owner has provided to the Company's transfer agent a valid U.S. Certification of Residence (Form 6166) or valid Irish Non-Resident Form V2.\n\nIrish  income  tax   may  also  arise  with  respect  to  dividends  paid  on  Medtronic's  ordinary  shares. A  U.S.  resident  who  meets  one  of  the  ex emptions  from  dividend withholding tax described above and who does not hold Medtronic shares through a branch or agency in Ireland through which a trade is carried on generally will not have any Irish income tax liability on a dividend paid by Medtronic. In addition, if a U.S. shareholder is subject to the dividend withholding tax , the withholding payment discharges any Irish income tax liability, provided the shareholder furnishes to the Irish Revenue authorities a statement of the dividend withholding tax imposed.\n\nWhile the U.S./Ireland Double Tax Treaty contains provisions regarding withholding, due to the wide scope of the exemptions from dividend withholding tax available under Irish domestic law, it would generally be unnecessary for a U.S. resident shareholder to rely on the treaty provisions.\n\n## Item 6.

      "question": "How has the treatment of Irish income tax on dividends paid to U.S. residents evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly regarding exemptions and withholding tax obligations?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Medtronic noted that U.S. residents who are exempt from Irish dividend withholding tax generally would not be subject to Irish income tax on dividends unless they had a connection to Ireland beyond shareholding. Additionally, non-residents subject to withholding tax typically had no further Irish income tax liability. In 2024, the company clarified that U.S. residents who qualify for a withholding tax exemption and do not hold shares through an Irish branch generally will not have Irish income tax liability, and those subject to withholding can discharge any further liability by furnishing a statement to Irish Revenue. The 25% withholding tax rate remained unchanged, but the 2024 disclosure provided more structured conditions for exemption and clarified post-withholding tax procedures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, the focus was on general exemptions from Irish dividend withholding tax and limited Irish income tax liability for U.S. shareholders, with a 25% withholding tax rate mentioned.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the disclosure expanded to include specific conditions for U.S. shareholders to qualify for exemptions, and introduced a process for discharging further Irish income tax liability through documentation to Irish Revenue.",
        "Step 3: The evolution shows a shift from general tax treatment information to more detailed procedural guidance, indicating a transformation in how the company communicates Irish tax obligations for U.S. shareholders."

By 2024, BMY had acquired Mirati for $4.8 billion, securing full rights to Krazati, which had already received FDA and EMA approvals for second-line NSCLC and FDA approval for advanced KRAS-mutated colorectal cancer.

      "answer": "In 2023, BMY had not yet acquired Mirati, and Krazati was not part of its portfolio. However, by 2024, BMY completed the acquisition of Mirati for $4.8 billion, gaining full rights to Krazati, a KRAS G12C inhibitor. Krazati had already received FDA approval for second-line NSCLC and was in clinical development for first-line NSCLC in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor. Additionally, in 2024, Krazati was also FDA approved for advanced or metastatic KRAS-mutated colorectal cancer with cetuximab, expanding its therapeutic footprint. This acquisition marked a significant evolution in BMY\u2019s oncology strategy, positioning it more strongly in the KRAS inhibition space.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2023, BMY did not have Krazati in its portfolio and had no disclosed involvement with Mirati.",
        "In 2024, BMY acquired Mirati for $4.8 billion, gaining access to Krazati and other clinical assets like PRMT5 Inhibitor.",
        "The acquisition and expanded approvals of Krazati reflect a strategic shift and enhancement in BMY\u2019s focus on KRAS inhibition."

      "answer": "In 2023, Bristol-Myers Squibb established the business risk and disclosure group specifically to comply with the SEC Consent Order. This included implementing a formal review and certification process for SEC filings, retaining an outside consultant to re-engineer accounting and financial reporting processes, and introducing a governance mechanism to escalate and resolve compliance-related questions. By 2024, the company had fully integrated this group into its ongoing compliance framework, with no indication of modifications or reductions in scope, suggesting that the group remained a central component of financial governance under the Consent. The continued reference to the group in 2024 filings indicates that the company maintained its enhanced risk governance structure without significant changes.",

          "chunk_text": "## Operating Activities\n\nCash flow from operating activities represents the cash receipts and disbursements from all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting net earnings for noncontrolling interest, non-cash operating items, gains and losses attributed to investing and financing activities and changes in operating assets and liabilities resulting from timing differences between the receipts and payments of cash and when the transactions are recognized in  our  results  of  operations. As  a  result,  changes  in  cash  from  operating  activities  reflect  the  timing  of  cash  collections  from  customers  and  alliance  partners; payments to suppliers, alliance partners and employees; customer discounts and rebates; and tax payments in the ordinary course of business.\n\nThe $1.3 billion increase in cash flow provided by operating activities compared to 2023, was primarily due to higher customer collections, net of rebates, discounts, and alliance payments ($3.4 billion) and lower income tax payments ($450 million), partially offset by higher acquisition-related payments, including cash settlement of unvested stock awards ($1.0 billion), and higher interest ex pense payments on debt ($600 million), as well as timing of payments in the ordinary course of business.\n\n## Investing Activities\n\nCash requirements from investing activities include cash used for acquisitions, manufacturing and facility-related capital expenditures and purchases of marketable securities with original maturities greater than 90 days at the time of purchase, proceeds from business divestitures (including royalties), the sale and maturity of marketable securities, sale of equity investments, as well as upfront and contingent milestones payments from licensing arrangements.\n\nThe $19.1 billion increase in cash flow used in investing activities compared to 2023 was due to payments for the Mirati, RayzeBio and Karuna acquisitions and SystImmune collaboration of $20.7 billion, partially offset by changes in the amount of marketable debt securities held of $1.4 billion.\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nCash requirements from financing activities include cash used to pay dividends, repurchase common stock and repay long-term debt and other borrowings, as well as proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of long-term debt and other borrowings.\n\nThe $14.5 billion change in cash provided by financing activities compared to 2023 was primarily due to higher net borrowings of $9.6 billion used primarily to fund our acquisitions and share repurchases of $5.2 billion in 2023.\n\n## Recently Issued Accounting Standards\n\nFor  recently  issued  accounting  standards,  refer  to  'Item  8.  Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data-Note  1. Accounting  Policies  and  Recently  Issued Accounting Standards.'\n\n## SEC Consent Order\n\nAs previously disclosed, on August 4, 2004, we entered into a final settlement with the SEC, concluding an investigation concerning certain wholesaler inventory and accounting matters. The settlement was reached through a Consent, a copy of which was attached as Exhibit 10 to our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2004.\n\nUnder the terms of the Consent, we agreed, subject to certain defined exceptions, to limit sales of all products sold to our direct customers (including wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, retail outlets, pharmacies and government purchasers) based on expected demand or on amounts that do not exceed approximately one month of  inventory  on  hand,  without  making  a  timely  public  disclosure  of  any  change  in  practice.  We  also  agreed  in  the  Consent  to  certain  measures  that  we  have implemented including: (a) establishing a formal review and certification process of our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC; (b) establishing a business risk and disclosure group; (c) retaining an outside consultant to comprehensively study and help re-engineer our accounting and financial reporting processes; (d) publicly disclosing any sales incentives offered to direct customers for the purpose of inducing them to purchase products in excess of expected demand; and (e) ensuring that our budget process gives appropriate weight to inputs that come from the bottom to the top, and not just from the top to the bottom, and adequately documenting that process.\n\nWe have established a company-wide policy concerning our sales to direct customers for the purpose of complying with the Consent, which includes the adoption of various procedures to monitor and limit sales to direct customers in accordance with the terms of the Consent. These procedures include a governance process to escalate to appropriate management levels potential questions or concerns regarding compliance with the policy and timely resolution of such questions or concerns. In addition, compliance with the policy is monitored on a regular basis.",

      "answer": "In 2023, the company established a formal review and certification process of SEC filings as part of the Consent agreement, which included governance procedures to escalate potential compliance concerns to appropriate management levels and regular monitoring of compliance. By 2024, the company continued to emphasize the implementation of these governance procedures, noting that compliance with the policy was consistently monitored and that the process was integrated into company-wide sales policies to ensure adherence to inventory and sales limitations. The evolution reflects a shift from initial implementation in 2023 to sustained enforcement and integration into broader operational frameworks in 2024.",

        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 - In 2023, the company established a formal review and certification process of SEC filings, including governance procedures for escalating compliance concerns and regular compliance monitoring.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 - In 2024, the company emphasized the ongoing implementation of these procedures, noting that compliance was monitored and integrated into broader company-wide sales policies under the Consent agreement.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The process evolved from being newly established in 2023 to being consistently applied and embedded within company operations in 2024, indicating a transformation in maturity and integration."

The settlement was reached through a Consent, a copy of which was attached as Exhibit 10 to our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2004.\n\nUnder the terms of the Consent, we agreed, subject to certain defined exceptions, to limit sales of all products sold to our direct customers (including wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, retail outlets, pharmacies and government purchasers) based on expected demand or on amounts that do not exceed approximately one month of  inventory  on  hand,  without  making  a  timely  public  disclosure  of  any  change  in  practice.  We  also  agreed  in  the  Consent  to  certain  measures  that  we  have implemented including: (a) establishing a formal review and certification process of our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC; (b) establishing a business risk and disclosure group; (c) retaining an outside consultant to comprehensively study and help re-engineer our accounting and financial reporting processes; (d) publicly disclosing any sales incentives offered to direct customers for the purpose of inducing them to purchase products in excess of expected demand; and (e) ensuring that our budget process gives appropriate weight to inputs that come from the bottom to the top, and not just from the top to the bottom, and adequately documenting that process.\n\nWe have established a company-wide policy concerning our sales to direct customers for the purpose of complying with the Consent, which includes the adoption of various procedures to monitor and limit sales to direct customers in accordance with the terms of the Consent. These procedures include a governance process to escalate to appropriate management levels potential questions or concerns regarding compliance with the policy and timely resolution of such questions or concerns. In addition, compliance with the policy is monitored on a regular basis.",

G12C G12C\n\nBMS acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Mirati's common stock for $58.00 per share in an all-cash transaction for a total consideration of $4.8 billion or $4.1 billion, net of cash acquired. Mirati stockholders also received one non-tradeable contingent value right (CVR) for each share of Mirati common stock held, potentially worth $12.00 per share in cash for a total value of approx imately $1.0 billion. The payout of the contingent value right is subject to the FDA acceptance of an NDA for PRMT5 Inhibitor for the treatment of specific indications within seven years of the closing of the transaction. The acquisition was funded through a combination of cash on hand and debt proceeds (see \"-Note 10. Financing Arrangements\" for further detail).\n\nThe transaction was accounted for as a business combination requiring all assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date.\n\nTotal consideration for the acquisition consisted of the following:\n\n",

      "question": "How has Pfizer's financial commitment to Paxlovid evolved between 2022 and 2024, based on remaining performance obligations and contracted revenue expectations?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Pfizer indicated that Paxlovid had the potential to provide ongoing revenue streams, though it acknowledged that post-pandemic revenues might not match the levels seen during the pandemic. By 2024, Pfizer reported that remaining performance obligations for Paxlovid totaled approximately $1 billion as of December 31, 2024, with contracted revenue expected to be recognized from 2025 through 2028. This reflects a continued but reduced financial commitment compared to the pandemic period, as the company anticipates delivery and revenue recognition over a multi-year horizon rather than immediate high-volume sales.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 (2022) \u2014 Pfizer acknowledged Paxlovid's revenue potential but noted that post-pandemic levels might not match pandemic-era sales.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 (2024) \u2014 Pfizer disclosed $1 billion in remaining performance obligations for Paxlovid, with revenue expected to be recognized from 2025 to 2028.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change \u2014 The financial commitment to Paxlovid has evolved from a high-volume, immediate delivery model during the pandemic to a more extended, moderate-level revenue expectation over several years."

          "chunk_text": "Paxlovid, while we believe that these products have the potential to provide ongoing revenue streams for Pfizer for the foreseeable future, revenues of these products following the COVID-19 pandemic may not be at the similar levels as those being generated during the pandemic. For information on additional risks associated with Comirnaty/BNT162b2 and Paxlovid, see the COVID-19 Pandemic section below.\n\nIn addition, we sell our prescription pharmaceutical products principally through wholesalers in the U.S. For additional information, see Note 17C . If one of our significant biopharmaceutical wholesalers should encounter financial or other difficulties, it might decrease the amount of business the wholesaler does with us and/or we might be unable to timely collect all the amounts that the wholesaler owes us or at all, which could negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, we expect that consolidation and integration of pharmacy chains and wholesalers will increase competitive and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers, including us.\n\n## RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nThe discovery and development of new products, as well as the development of additional uses for existing products, are necessary for the continued strength of our business. Our product lines must be replenished over time to offset revenue losses when products lose exclusivity or market share, as well as to provide for earnings growth, primarily through internal R&amp;D or through collaborations, acquisitions, JVs, licensing or other arrangements. Growth depends in large part on our ability to identify and develop new products or new indications for existing products that address unmet medical needs and receive reimbursement from payers. However, balancing current growth, investment for future growth and the delivery of shareholder return remains a major challenge. The costs of product development continue to be high, as are regulatory requirements in many therapeutic areas, which may affect the number of candidates we are able to fund as well as the sustainability of the R&amp;D portfolio. Decisions made early in the development process of a drug or vaccine candidate can have a substantial impact on the marketing strategy and payer reimbursement possibilities if the candidate receives regulatory approval. We try to plan clinical trials prudently and to reasonably anticipate and address challenges, but there is no assurance that an optimal balance between trial conduct, speed and desired outcome will be achieved.\n\nAdditionally, our product candidates can fail at any stage of the R&amp;D process, and may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of R&amp;D. We may fail to correctly identify indications for which our science is promising or allocate R&amp;D investment resources efficiently, and failure to invest in the right technology platforms, therapeutic areas, product classes, geographic markets and/or licensing opportunities could adversely impact the productivity of our pipeline. Further, even if we identify areas with the greatest commercial potential, the scientific approach may not succeed despite the significant investment required for R&amp;D, and the product may not be as competitive as expected because of the highly dynamic market environment and the hurdles in terms of access and reimbursement. For example, our gene therapy product candidates are based on a novel technology with only a few gene therapies approved to date, which makes it difficult to predict the time and cost of development and the ability to obtain regulatory approval. Further, gene therapy may face difficulties in gaining the acceptance of patients or the medical community.\n\n## GLOBAL OPERATIONS\n\nWe operate on a global scale and could be affected by currency fluctuations, capital and exchange controls, global economic conditions including inflation, expropriation and other restrictive government actions, changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies, trade regulations, tax laws and regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, and marketing of, reimbursement for and access to our products, as well as impacts of political or civil unrest or military action, including the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, terrorist activity, unstable governments and legal systems, inter-governmental disputes, public health outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, natural disasters or disruptions related to climate change.\n\nSome emerging market countries may be particularly vulnerable to periods of financial or political instability or significant currency fluctuations or may have limited resources for healthcare spending. As a result of these and other factors, our strategy to grow in emerging markets may not be successful, and growth rates in these markets may not be sustainable.\n\nGovernment financing and economic pressures can lead to negative pricing pressure in various markets where governments take an active role in setting prices, access criteria (e.g., through health technology assessments) or other means of cost control. For additional information on government pricing pressures, see the Item 1. Business-Government Regulation and Price Constraints section in this Form 10-K.\n\nWe continue to monitor the global trade environment and potential trade conflicts and impediments that could impact our business. If trade restrictions or tariffs reduce global economic activity, potential impacts could include declining sales; increased costs; volatility in foreign exchange rates; a decline in the value of our financial assets and pension plan investments; required increases of our pension funding obligations; increased government cost control efforts; delays or failures in the performance of customers, suppliers and other third parties on whom we may depend for the performance of our business; and the risk that our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be adequate.\n\nWe operate in many countries and transact in over 100 different currencies. Changes in the value of those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, or high inflation in these countries, can impact our revenues, costs and expenses and our financial guidance. Significant portions of our revenues, costs and expenses, as well as our substantial international net assets, are exposed to exchange rate changes. 63% of our total 2021 revenues were derived from international operations, including 29% from Europe and 19% from China, Japan and the rest of Asia. Future changes in exchange rates or economic conditions and the impact they may have on our results of operations, financial condition or business are difficult to predict. For additional information about our exposure to foreign currency risk, see the Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity, Capital Resources and Market Risk section within MD&amp;A.\n\nIn addition, our borrowing, pension benefit and postretirement benefit obligations and interest-bearing investments, are subject to risk from changes in interest and exchange rates. The risks related to interest-bearing investments and borrowings and the measures we have taken to help contain them are discussed in the Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity, Capital Resources and Market Risk section within MD&amp;A and Note 7E . For additional details on critical accounting estimates and assumptions for our benefit plans, see the Significant Accounting Policies and Application of Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions-Benefit Plans section within MD&amp;A and Note 11 .\n\nFrom time to time, we issued variable rate debt based on LIBOR, or undertook interest rate swaps that contain a variable element based on LIBOR. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced in 2017 that it will no longer compel banks to submit rates used to calculate LIBOR after 2021. This deadline was extended until June 2023 for a number of key U.S. dollar benchmark maturities (including the 1-month and 3-month\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n15",

      "answer": "In 2022, Paxlovid was under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in the U.S. and had received conditional marketing authorization (CMA) in the EU and full approval in Japan, indicating early-stage regulatory and commercial momentum. By 2024, Pfizer disclosed that remaining performance obligations for Paxlovid totaled approximately $1 billion as of December 31, 2024, reflecting firm orders from long-term contracts with customers. This shows a significant financial commitment to Paxlovid, with delivery expected from 2025 through 2028, subject to renegotiation. Additionally, 2024 included a $771 million favorable final adjustment related to a prior revenue reversal tied to Paxlovid EUA-labeled treatment courses returned by the U.S. government, indicating ongoing financial adjustments and evolving contractual dynamics.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 \u2014 In 2022, Paxlovid received EUA in the U.S. and CMA in the EU, with initial regulatory approvals indicating early-stage commercialization.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 \u2014 In 2024, Pfizer disclosed $1 billion in remaining performance obligations for Paxlovid, showing a firm financial commitment, and a $771 million favorable adjustment tied to prior revenue reversals related to the product.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change \u2014 The shift from regulatory approval in 2022 to multi-year contractual obligations and revenue adjustments in 2024 indicates a significant evolution in Pfizer\u2019s financial and operational relationship with Paxlovid."

      "answer": "In 2023, Merck reported a $1.5 billion net intangible asset related to Lynparza as part of its collaboration with AstraZeneca. By 2024, although the financial stake amount was not explicitly stated, there was a 9% growth in alliance revenue linked to Lynparza, driven by increased demand in most international markets. Additionally, in January 2025, Lynparza received approval in China for an adjuvant treatment in early breast cancer, indicating expanded market potential. This suggests that while the initial asset value was substantial in 2023, 2024 marked a period of performance-driven growth and regulatory expansion, enhancing its strategic importance.",

Lynparza is approved for the treatment of certain types of advanced or recurrent ovarian, early or metastatic breast, metastatic pancreatic and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancers. A lliance revenue related to Lynparza grew 9% in 2024 largely due to higher demand in most international markets. In January 2025, China's NM PA  approved Lynparza as adjuvant treatment for adult patients with germline BRCA -mutated, HER2-negative high-risk early breast cancer, based on the OlympiA  trial.\n\nLenvima is an oral receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor being developed and commercialized as part of a collaboration with Eisai (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). Lenvima is approved for the treatment of certain types of thyroid cancer, RCC, HCC, in combination with everolimus for certain patients with advanced RCC, and in combination with Keytruda for certain patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma or advanced RCC. A lliance revenue related to Lenvima grew 5% in 2024 primarily reflecting higher demand and pricing in the U.S.\n\nSales  of Welireg , for the treatment of adult patients with certain V HL disease-associated tumors and certain adult patients with previously treated advanced RCC, more than doubled in 2024 primarily due to higher demand in the U.S. reflecting in part continued uptake of the RCC indication following approval by the FDA  in December 2023. In November 2024, Welireg was approved in China for the treatment of adult patients with certain V HL disease-associated tumors not requiring immediate surgery based on the LITESPARK-004 clinical trial. In February 2025, the EC conditionally approved Welireg as monotherapy both for the treatment of adult patients with V HL disease who require therapy for associated, localized RCC, central nervous system hemangioblastomas, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and for whom localized procedures are unsuitable, and for the treatment of adult patients with advanced clear cell RCC that progressed following two or more lines of therapy that included a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor and at least two V EGF targeted therapies. The EC approval of these two indications is based on results from the LITESPARK-004 and LITESPARK-005 trials. The conditional approval of Welireg will be v alid for one y ear, subject to y early  renewal, pending certain additional clinical data. Timing for commercial availability of Welireg in individual EU countries will depend on multiple factors, including the completion of national reimbursement procedures.\n\nReblozyl is a first-in-class erythroid maturation recombinant fusion protein that is being commercialized through a global collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb Company (BMS) (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). Reblozyl is approved for the treatment of anemia in certain rare blood disorders. A lliance revenue related to this collaboration (consisting of royalties) increased 75% in 2024 due to strong underlying sales performance.\n\n## Vaccines\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2023, Merck primarily used forward exchange contracts to offset the effects of exchange on exposures when economically beneficial, focusing on the euro, Swiss franc, Japanese yen, and Chinese renminbi. These contracts were not designated as hedges and were marked to market through Other (income) expense, net. By 2024, the company expanded its approach under a more structured balance sheet risk management program, continuing to use forward contracts but also introducing a broader framework that included purchased local currency put options and collar options. Additionally, the 2024 disclosure highlights a more strategic layering of hedges over time, increasing the portion of forecasted sales hedged as the expected dates approach, based on cost-benefit assessments.",

F inancial Instruments\n\n## Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\n\nThe Company manages the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on its earnings, cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities through operational means and through the use of various financial instruments, including derivative instruments.\n\nA significant portion of the Company's revenues and earnings in foreign affiliates is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. The objectives of and accounting related to the Company's foreign currency risk management program, as well as its interest rate risk management activities are discussed below.\n\n## Foreign Currency Risk M anagement\n\nThe Company has established revenue hedging, balance sheet risk management and net investment hedging programs to protect against volatility of future foreign currency cash flows and changes in fair value caused by changes in foreign exchange rates.\n\nThe objective of the revenue hedging program is to reduce the variability caused by changes in foreign exchange rates that would affect the U.S. dollar value of future cash flows derived from foreign currency denominated sales, primarily the euro, Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi. T o achieve this objective, the Company will hedge a portion of its forecasted foreign currency denominated third-party and intercompany distributor entity sales (forecasted sales) that are expected to occur over its planning cycle, typically no more than two years into the future. The Company will layer in hedges over time, increasing the portion of forecasted sales hedged as it gets closer to the expected date of the forecasted sales. The portion of forecasted sales hedged is based on assessments of costbenefit profiles that consider natural offsetting exposures, revenue and foreign exchange rate volatilities and correlations, and the cost of hedging instruments. The Company manages its anticipated transaction exposure principally with purchased local currency put options, forward contracts, and purchased collar options.\n\nThe fair values of these derivative contracts are recorded as either assets (gain positions) or liabilities (loss positions) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts are recorded each period in either current earnings or OCI depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction. For derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges, the unrealized gains or losses on these contracts are recorded in AOCL and reclassified into Sales when the hedged anticipated revenue is recognized. The amount reclassified into earnings as a result of the discontinuation of cash flow hedges because it was no longer deemed probable the forecasted hedged transactions would occur was not material for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022. For those derivatives which are not designated as cash flow hedges, but serve as economic hedges of forecasted sales, unrealized gains or losses are recorded in Sales each period. The cash flows from both designated and non-designated contracts are reported as operating activities in the  Consolidated  Statement of  Cash  Flows.  The  Company does not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.\n\nThe Company manages operating activities and net asset positions at each local subsidiary in order to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange on monetary assets and liabilities. M onetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of a given subsidiary are remeasured at spot rates in effect on the balance sheet date with the effects of changes in spot rates reported in Other (income) expense, net . The Company also uses a balance sheet risk management program to mitigate the exposure of such assets and liabilities from the effects of volatility in foreign exchange.

      "question": "How did the commercialization and market expansion of Lynparza evolve between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of geographic approvals and revenue growth?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Lynparza received FDA and Japan's MHLW approvals for treating BRCA-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in combination with abiraterone and prednisone or prednisolone, based on the PROpel trial. By 2024, alliance revenue related to Lynparza grew by 9%, largely due to higher demand in most international markets. Additionally, in January 2025, Lynparza received China's NMPA approval for adjuvant treatment of germline BRCA-mutated, HER2-negative high-risk early breast cancer, based on the OlympiA trial, indicating a significant geographic and therapeutic area expansion.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 - In 2023, Lynparza was approved in the U.S. and Japan for BRCA-mutated mCRPC based on the PROpel trial.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 - In 2024, Lynparza's alliance revenue grew by 9%, and in early 2025, it received a new approval in China for early breast cancer based on the OlympiA trial.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - Lynparza expanded both therapeutically and geographically, moving from prostate cancer approvals in 2023 to a new early breast cancer indication in China by early 2025, with moderate revenue growth in 2024."

A lliance revenue related to Lenvima grew 5% in 2024 primarily reflecting higher demand and pricing in the U.S.\n\nSales  of Welireg , for the treatment of adult patients with certain V HL disease-associated tumors and certain adult patients with previously treated advanced RCC, more than doubled in 2024 primarily due to higher demand in the U.S. reflecting in part continued uptake of the RCC indication following approval by the FDA  in December 2023. In November 2024, Welireg was approved in China for the treatment of adult patients with certain V HL disease-associated tumors not requiring immediate surgery based on the LITESPARK-004 clinical trial. In February 2025, the EC conditionally approved Welireg as monotherapy both for the treatment of adult patients with V HL disease who require therapy for associated, localized RCC, central nervous system hemangioblastomas, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and for whom localized procedures are unsuitable, and for the treatment of adult patients with advanced clear cell RCC that progressed following two or more lines of therapy that included a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor and at least two V EGF targeted therapies. The EC approval of these two indications is based on results from the LITESPARK-004 and LITESPARK-005 trials. The conditional approval of Welireg will be v alid for one y ear, subject to y early  renewal, pending certain additional clinical data. Timing for commercial availability of Welireg in individual EU countries will depend on multiple factors, including the completion of national reimbursement procedures.\n\nReblozyl is a first-in-class erythroid maturation recombinant fusion protein that is being commercialized through a global collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb Company (BMS) (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).

The Company pays an additional 2% royalty on worldwide sales of Keytruda to another third party , the termination date of which varies by country; this royalty expired in the U.S. in September 2024 and will expire on varying dates in major European markets in the second half of 2025. The royalty expenses are included in Cost of sales .\n\nLynparza is an oral poly (A DP-ribose) polymerase (PA RP) inhibitor being developed and commercialized as part of a collaboration with A straZeneca (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). Lynparza is approved for the treatment of certain types of advanced or recurrent ovarian, early or metastatic breast, metastatic pancreatic and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancers. A lliance revenue related to Lynparza grew 9% in 2024 largely due to higher demand in most international markets. In January 2025, China's NM PA  approved Lynparza as adjuvant treatment for adult patients with germline BRCA -mutated, HER2-negative high-risk early breast cancer, based on the OlympiA  trial.\n\nLenvima is an oral receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor being developed and commercialized as part of a collaboration with Eisai (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). Lenvima is approved for the treatment of certain types of thyroid cancer, RCC, HCC, in combination with everolimus for certain patients with advanced RCC, and in combination with Keytruda for certain patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma or advanced RCC. A lliance revenue related to Lenvima grew 5% in 2024 primarily reflecting higher demand and pricing in the U.S.\n\nSales  of Welireg , for the treatment of adult patients with certain V HL disease-associated tumors and certain adult patients with previously treated advanced RCC, more than doubled in 2024 primarily due to higher demand in the U.S. reflecting in part continued uptake of the RCC indication following approval by the FDA  in December 2023. In November 2024, Welireg was approved in China for the treatment of adult patients with certain V HL disease-associated tumors not requiring immediate surgery based on the LITESPARK-004 clinical trial. In February 2025, the EC conditionally approved Welireg as monotherapy both for the treatment of adult patients with V HL disease who require therapy for associated, localized RCC, central nervous system hemangioblastomas, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and for whom localized procedures are unsuitable, and for the treatment of adult patients with advanced clear cell RCC that progressed following two or more lines of therapy that included a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor and at least two V EGF targeted therapies. The EC approval of these two indications is based on results from the LITESPARK-004 and LITESPARK-005 trials. The conditional approval of Welireg will be v alid for one y ear, subject to y early  renewal, pending certain additional clinical data. Timing for commercial availability of Welireg in individual EU countries will depend on multiple factors, including the completion of national reimbursement procedures.\n\nReblozyl is a first-in-class erythroid maturation recombinant fusion protein that is being commercialized through a global collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb Company (BMS) (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). Reblozyl is approved for the treatment of anemia in certain rare blood disorders. A lliance revenue related to this collaboration (consisting of royalties) increased 75% in 2024 due to strong underlying sales performance.\n\n## Vaccines\n\n",

      "question": "How has Merck's approach to managing balance sheet risk through forward exchange contracts evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of the currencies and cost-benefit considerations?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Merck explicitly outlined a balance sheet risk management program that involved the use of forward exchange contracts to offset exposures in both developed and developing country currencies, with a specific mention of the Chinese renminbi. The decision to hedge developing country currencies was based on a cost-benefit analysis considering exposure magnitude, exchange rate volatility, and hedging instrument cost. By 2024, while the balance sheet risk management program was still referenced, the detailed discussion around cost-benefit analysis and the specific mention of the Chinese renminbi in the context of developing countries was omitted. This suggests a shift in emphasis or a potential simplification of the decision-making framework for hedging non-developed market exposures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Merck's balance sheet risk management program specifically included forward contracts for both developed (euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc) and developing (e.g., Chinese renminbi) currencies, with explicit cost-benefit considerations.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the balance sheet risk management program is still referenced, but the detailed cost-benefit rationale and the mention of the Chinese renminbi are no longer included, indicating a change in how the program is described or potentially applied.",
        "Step 3: The omission of specific currencies and the cost-benefit framework in 2024 suggests a qualitative evolution in how Merck communicates its balance sheet risk management strategy, possibly signaling a reduced emphasis on developing market exposures or a streamlined hedging policy."

Financial Instruments\n\n## Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\n\nThe Company manages the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on its earnings, cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities through operational means and through the use of various financial instruments, including derivative instruments.\n\nA significant  portion  of  the  Company's  revenues  and  earnings  in  foreign  affiliates  is  exposed  to  changes  in  foreign exchange rates. The objectives of and accounting related to the Company's foreign currency risk management program, as well as its interest rate risk management activities are discussed below.\n\n## Foreign Currency Risk Management\n\nThe Company has established revenue hedging, balance sheet risk management and net investment hedging programs to protect against volatility of future foreign currency cash flows and changes in fair value caused by changes in foreign exchange rates.\n\nThe objective of the revenue hedging program is to reduce the variability caused by changes in foreign exchange rates that would affect the U.S. dollar value of future cash flows derived from foreign currency denominated sales, primarily the euro, Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi. To achieve this objective, the Company will hedge a portion of its forecasted foreign currency denominated third-party and intercompany distributor entity sales (forecasted sales) that are expected to occur over its planning cycle, typically no more than two years into the future. The Company will layer in hedges over time, increasing the portion of forecasted sales hedged as it gets closer to the expected date of the forecasted sales. The portion of forecasted sales hedged is based on  assessments  of  cost-benefit  profiles  that  consider  natural  offsetting  exposures,  revenue  and  exchange  rate  volatilities  and correlations,  and  the  cost  of  hedging  instruments.  The  Company  manages  its  anticipated  transaction  exposure  principally  with purchased local currency put options, forward contracts, and purchased collar options.\n\nThe fair values of these derivative contracts are recorded as either assets (gain positions) or liabilities (loss positions) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts are recorded each period in either current earnings or OCI depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction. For derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges, the unrealized gains or losses on these contracts are recorded in AOCL and reclassified into Sales when the hedged anticipated revenue is recognized. For those derivatives which are not designated as cash flow hedges, but serve as economic hedges of forecasted sales, unrealized gains or losses are recorded in Sales each period. The cash flows from both designated and non-designated contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Company does not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.\n\nThe  Company  manages  operating  activities  and  net  asset  positions  at  each  local  subsidiary  in  order  to  mitigate  the effects  of  exchange  on  monetary  assets  and  liabilities.  The  Company  also  uses  a  balance  sheet  risk  management  program  to mitigate the exposure of net monetary assets that are denominated in a currency other than a subsidiary's functional currency from the effects of volatility in foreign exchange. In these instances, Merck principally utilizes forward exchange contracts to offset the effects of exchange on exposures denominated in developed country currencies, primarily the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar and Swiss franc. For exposures in developing country currencies, including the Chinese renminbi, the Company will enter into forward contracts to offset the effects of exchange on exposures when it is deemed economical to do so based on a cost-benefit analysis that considers the magnitude of the exposure, the volatility of the exchange rate and the cost of the hedging instrument. The cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of a given subsidiary are remeasured at spot rates in effect on the balance sheet date with the effects of changes in spot rates reported in Other (income) expense, net . The forward contracts are not designated as hedges and are marked to market through Other (income) expense, net . Accordingly,  fair  value  changes  in  the  forward  contracts  help  mitigate  the  changes  in  the  value  of  the  remeasured  assets  and liabilities  attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, except to the extent of the spot-forward differences. These differences are not significant due to the short-term nature of the contracts, which typically have average maturities at inception of less than one year.",

The Company pays an additional 2% royalty on worldwide sales of Keytruda to another third party , the termination date of which varies by country; this royalty expired in the U.S. in September 2024 and will expire on varying dates in major European markets in the second half of 2025.

Lynparza is approved for the treatment of certain types of advanced or recurrent ovarian, early or metastatic breast, metastatic pancreatic and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancers. A lliance revenue related to Lynparza grew 9% in 2024 largely due to higher demand in most international markets. In January 2025, China's NM PA  approved Lynparza as adjuvant treatment for adult patients with germline BRCA -mutated, HER2-negative high-risk early breast cancer, based on the OlympiA  trial.\n\nLenvima is an oral receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor being developed and commercialized as part of a collaboration with Eisai (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). Lenvima is approved for the treatment of certain types of thyroid cancer, RCC, HCC, in combination with everolimus for certain patients with advanced RCC, and in combination with Keytruda for certain patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma or advanced RCC. A lliance revenue related to Lenvima grew 5% in 2024 primarily reflecting higher demand and pricing in the U.S.\n\nSales  of Welireg , for the treatment of adult patients with certain V HL disease-associated tumors and certain adult patients with previously treated advanced RCC, more than doubled in 2024 primarily due to higher demand in the U.S. reflecting in part continued uptake of the RCC indication following approval by the FDA  in December 2023. In November 2024, Welireg was approved in China for the treatment of adult patients with certain V HL disease-associated tumors not requiring immediate surgery based on the LITESPARK-004 clinical trial. In February 2025, the EC conditionally approved Welireg as monotherapy both for the treatment of adult patients with V HL disease who require therapy for associated, localized RCC, central nervous system hemangioblastomas, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and for whom localized procedures are unsuitable, and for the treatment of adult patients with advanced clear cell RCC that progressed following two or more lines of therapy that included a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor and at least two V EGF targeted therapies. The EC approval of these two indications is based on results from the LITESPARK-004 and LITESPARK-005 trials. The conditional approval of Welireg will be v alid for one y ear, subject to y early  renewal, pending certain additional clinical data. Timing for commercial availability of Welireg in individual EU countries will depend on multiple factors, including the completion of national reimbursement procedures.\n\nReblozyl is a first-in-class erythroid maturation recombinant fusion protein that is being commercialized through a global collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb Company (BMS) (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). Reblozyl is approved for the treatment of anemia in certain rare blood disorders. A lliance revenue related to this collaboration (consisting of royalties) increased 75% in 2024 due to strong underlying sales performance.\n\n## Vaccines\n\n",

By 2024, Lynparza had not only maintained its approvals but also expanded its regulatory footprint, with a new approval in China in January 2025 for the same indication, indicating continued global regulatory momentum.

This submission is based on data from the KEYNOTE-158 trial. The FDA set a PDUFA date of March 28, 2022.\n\nKeytruda is  under  review  in  the  EU  for  the  treatment  of  unresectable  or  metastatic  MSI-H  or  dMMR  colorectal, endometrial,  gastric,  small  intestine,  biliary,  or  pancreatic  cancer  in  adults  who  have  received  prior  therapy.  The  proposed indication is based on the results from the KEYNOTE-164 and KEYNOTE-158 trials.\n\nKeytruda in  combination  with  chemotherapy is under review in the EU and Japan for the treatment of patients with high-risk, early-stage TNBC as neoadjuvant treatment, and then as a single agent as adjuvant treatment after surgery based on data from the KEYNOTE-522 trial.\n\nKeytruda is under review in Japan for treatment of adult patients with advanced or recurrent TMB-H solid tumors that have progressed after chemotherapy (limited to use when difficult to treat with standard of care) based on the KEYNOTE-158 trial.\n\nKeytruda in combination with chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab is also under review in the EU and Japan for the first-line treatment of patients with persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer based on the KEYNOTE-826 trial.\n\nIn January 2021, Merck, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer and the European Thoracic Oncology Platform announced that the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-091 trial investigating Keytruda met one of its dual primary endpoints of  disease-free  survival  (DFS)  for  the  adjuvant  treatment  of  patients  with  stage  IB-IIIA  NSCLC  following  surgical  resection regardless of PD-L1 expression. Based on an interim analysis review conducted by an independent Data Monitoring Committee, adjuvant treatment with Keytruda resulted in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in DFS compared with  placebo  in  the  all-comer  population  of  patients  with  stage  IB-IIIA  NSCLC.  At  the  interim  analysis,  there  was  also  an improvement  in  DFS  for  patients  whose  tumors  express  PD-L1  (tumor  proportion  score  [TPS]  \u226550%)  treated  with Keytruda compared to placebo; however, this dual primary endpoint did not meet statistical significance per the pre-specified statistical plan. The trial will continue to analyze DFS in patients whose tumors express high levels of PD-L1 (TPS \u226550%) and evaluate overall survival, a key secondary endpoint. Results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and will be submitted to regulatory authorities.\n\nMK-7339,  Lynparza,  is  an  oral  PARP  inhibitor  currently  approved  for  certain  types  of  advanced  ovarian,  breast, pancreatic and prostate cancers being co-developed for multiple cancer types as part of a collaboration with AstraZeneca PLC. In November 2021, the FDA accepted for priority review a supplemental NDA for Lynparza for the adjuvant treatment of patients with BRCA -mutated, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative high-risk, early-stage breast cancer who have already been treated with chemotherapy either before or after surgery based on the results from the Phase 3 OlympiA trial. The FDA set a PDUFA date during the first quarter of 2022.",

Under the terms of the more significant of these agreements, M erck paid a royalty of 6.5% on worldwide sales of Keytruda through December 2023 to one third party; this royalty declined to 2.5% in 2024 and will continue through 2026 terminating thereafter. The Company pays an additional 2% royalty on worldwide sales of Keytruda to another third party , the termination date of which varies by country; this royalty expired in the U.S. in September 2024 and will expire on varying dates in major European markets in the second half of 2025. The royalty expenses are included in Cost of sales .\n\nLynparza is an oral poly (A DP-ribose) polymerase (PA RP) inhibitor being developed and commercialized as part of a collaboration with A straZeneca (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). Lynparza is approved for the treatment of certain types of advanced or recurrent ovarian, early or metastatic breast, metastatic pancreatic and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancers. A lliance revenue related to Lynparza grew 9% in 2024 largely due to higher demand in most international markets. In January 2025, China's NM PA  approved Lynparza as adjuvant treatment for adult patients with germline BRCA -mutated, HER2-negative high-risk early breast cancer, based on the OlympiA  trial.\n\nLenvima is an oral receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor being developed and commercialized as part of a collaboration with Eisai (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). Lenvima is approved for the treatment of certain types of thyroid cancer, RCC, HCC, in combination with everolimus for certain patients with advanced RCC, and in combination with Keytruda for certain patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma or advanced RCC. A lliance revenue related to Lenvima grew 5% in 2024 primarily reflecting higher demand and pricing in the U.S.\n\nSales  of Welireg , for the treatment of adult patients with certain V HL disease-associated tumors and certain adult patients with previously treated advanced RCC, more than doubled in 2024 primarily due to higher demand in the U.S. reflecting in part continued uptake of the RCC indication following approval by the FDA  in December 2023. In November 2024, Welireg was approved in China for the treatment of adult patients with certain V HL disease-associated tumors not requiring immediate surgery based on the LITESPARK-004 clinical trial. In February 2025, the EC conditionally approved Welireg as monotherapy both for the treatment of adult patients with V HL disease who require therapy for associated, localized RCC, central nervous system hemangioblastomas, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and for whom localized procedures are unsuitable, and for the treatment of adult patients with advanced clear cell RCC that progressed following two or more lines of therapy that included a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor and at least two V EGF targeted therapies. The EC approval of these two indications is based on results from the LITESPARK-004 and LITESPARK-005 trials. The conditional approval of Welireg will be v alid for one y ear, subject to y early  renewal, pending certain additional clinical data. Timing for commercial availability of Welireg in individual EU countries will depend on multiple factors, including the completion of national reimbursement procedures.\n\nReblozyl is a first-in-class erythroid maturation recombinant fusion protein that is being commercialized through a global collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb Company (BMS) (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). Reblozyl is approved for the treatment of anemia in certain rare blood disorders. A lliance revenue related to this collaboration (consisting of royalties) increased 75% in 2024 due to strong underlying sales performance.\n\n## Vaccines\n\n",

      "question": "How has Merck's financial and strategic involvement in the Lynparza collaboration with AstraZeneca evolved from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of asset amortization and alliance revenue growth?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Merck was amortizing an intangible asset balance of $1.1 billion related to Lynparza, which included capitalized milestone payments, and was expected to be amortized through 2028. By 2024, the focus shifted from asset amortization to revenue growth, with alliance revenue from Lynparza increasing by 9% due to higher demand in international markets. Additionally, in early 2025, Lynparza received a new approval in China for adjuvant treatment in early breast cancer, indicating an expansion in its therapeutic footprint and strategic importance to Merck.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Merck was amortizing a $1.1 billion intangible asset related to Lynparza, reflecting past milestone payments and long-term financial commitment.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the focus shifted to revenue growth (9% increase) and new regulatory approvals, showing a transition from investment amortization to strategic product expansion.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a maturation of the collaboration from a capital investment phase to a revenue and growth phase, with Lynparza becoming more established in global markets."

Under the terms of the agreement, AstraZeneca and Merck will share the development and commercialization costs for Lynparza and Koselugo monotherapy and non-PD-L1/PD-1 combination therapy opportunities.\n\nProfits from Lynparza and Koselugo product sales generated through monotherapies or combination therapies are shared equally.  AstraZeneca  is  the  principal  on  Lynparza  and  Koselugo  sales  transactions.  Merck  records  its  share  of  Lynparza  and Koselugo product sales, net of cost of sales and commercialization costs, as alliance revenue, and its share of development costs associated with the collaboration as part of Research and development expenses. Reimbursements received from AstraZeneca for research and development expenses are recognized as reductions to Research and development costs.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Merck made an upfront payment to AstraZeneca and also made payments over a multi-year period for certain license options. In addition, the agreement provides for contingent payments from Merck to AstraZeneca related to  the  successful  achievement  of  sales-based  and  regulatory  milestones.  Merck  made  sales-based  milestone  payments  to AstraZeneca aggregating $550 million and $200 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, sales-based milestone payments accrued but not yet paid totaled $400 million. Potential future sales-based milestone payments of $2.7 billion have not yet been accrued as they are not deemed by the Company to be probable at this time.\n\nIn 2020 and 2019, Lynparza received regulatory approvals triggering capitalized milestone payments of $160 million and $60 million, respectively, in the aggregate from Merck to AstraZeneca. Potential future regulatory milestone payments of $1.4 billion remain under the agreement.\n\nThe  intangible  asset  balance  related  to  Lynparza  (which  includes  capitalized  sales-based  and  regulatory  milestone payments) was $1.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and is included in Other Intangibles, Net .

      "question": "How has the status and interest rate structure of the 3.625% Notes evolved from 2022 to 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's debt management strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, the 3.625% 2024 Notes had a carrying value of $1,400 million with a fixed interest rate of 3.625%. By 2024, these notes were fully paid off, as indicated by the $0 notional amount, and were replaced with floating interest rates tied to SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate). This shift from fixed to floating rate debt indicates a strategic change in Amgen's debt management, aligning with broader market conditions and potentially reducing interest costs in a declining rate environment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, the 3.625% 2024 Notes had a carrying value of $1,400 million and carried a fixed interest rate of 3.625%.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the 3.625% 2024 Notes had a notional amount of $0, indicating they were fully repaid, and new debt issuances were tied to SOFR-based floating interest rates.",
        "Step 3: The transition from fixed-rate debt to floating-rate debt suggests a strategic shift in Amgen\u2019s capital structure management, possibly to take advantage of more favorable interest rate conditions."

By the 2024 filing, the interest rate structure for the same notes had transitioned to a floating rate tied to SOFR+2.1%. This change indicates that Amgen shifted from bearing fixed interest rate risk to assuming floating rate risk for this debt instrument, altering its exposure to market interest rate fluctuations.",

By 2023, the strategic focus had evolved to broaden Opdivo's use in earlier lines of therapy, expand into new tumor types, and accelerate next-wave oncology mechanisms, with particular emphasis on refractory oncology patients and the potential of a subcutaneous formulation. Additionally, Opdivo was positioned within a broader IO portfolio that now includes Opdualag for melanoma and other combination therapies.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Opdivo was described as operating in a highly competitive marketplace, facing challenges from other IO products, new FDA-approved agents, and combination therapies. The document emphasized the intense competition in approved indications such as lung cancer and melanoma. By 2023, the strategic focus had evolved to emphasize expanding Opdivo into earlier lines of therapy, new tumor types, and combination treatments, including with Yervoy and other anti-cancer agents. Additionally, 2023 highlighted the potential of an investigational subcutaneous formulation of Opdivo to bring enhanced benefits to patients in the next decade, indicating a shift toward innovation and long-term development.",

          "chunk_text": "Advancements in treating cancer with IO therapies continue to evolve at a rapid pace. Our IO products, particularly Opdivo , operate in a highly competitive marketplace. In addition to competing for market share with other IO products in approved indications such as lung cancer and melanoma, we face increased competition from existing competing IO products that receive FDA approval for additional indications and for new IO agents that receive FDA approval and enter the market. Furthermore, as therapies combining different  IO  products  or  IO  products  with  existing  chemotherapy  or  targeted  therapy  treatments  are  investigated  for  potential expanded approvals, we anticipate that our IO products will continue to experience intense competition.\n\nAnother  competitive  challenge  we  face  is  from  generic  pharmaceutical  manufacturers.  In  the  U.S.  and  the  EU,  the  regulatory approval  process  exempts  generics  from  costly  and  time-consuming  clinical  studies  to  demonstrate  their  safety  and  efficacy, allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy of the innovator product. As a result, generic pharmaceutical manufacturers  typically  invest  far  less  in  R&amp;D  than  research-based  pharmaceutical  companies  and  therefore  can  price  their products significantly lower than branded products. Accordingly, when a branded product loses its market exclusivity, it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product. Upon the expiration or loss of market exclusivity on a product, we can lose the major portion of that product's revenue in a very short period of time.\n\nAfter the expiration of exclusivity, the rate of revenue decline of a product varies by country. In general, the decline in the U.S. market is more rapid than in most other developed countries, though we have observed rapid declines in a number of EU countries as well. Also, the declines in developed countries tend to be more rapid than in developing countries. The rate of revenue decline after the expiration of exclusivity has also historically been influenced by product characteristics. For example, drugs that are used in a large patient population (e.g., those prescribed by key primary care physicians) tend to experience more rapid declines than drugs  in  specialized  areas  of  medicine  (e.g.,  oncology).  Drugs  that  are  more  complex  to  manufacture  (e.g.,  sterile  injectable products) usually experience a slower decline than those that are simpler to manufacture.\n\nIn certain countries outside the U.S., patent protection is weak or nonexistent and we must compete with generic versions shortly after we launch our innovative products. In addition, generic pharmaceutical companies may introduce a generic product before exclusivity has expired, and before the resolution of any related patent litigation. For more information about market exclusivity, refer to '-Products, Intellectual Property and Product Exclusivity.'\n\nWe believe our long-term competitive position depends upon our success in discovering and developing innovative, cost-effective products that serve unmet medical needs, along with our ability to manufacture products efficiently and to market them effectively in a highly competitive environment.\n\n## Pricing, Price Constraints and Market Access\n\nOur medicines are priced based on a number of factors, including the value of scientific innovation for patients and society in the context of overall health care spend, economic factors impacting health care systems' ability to provide appropriate and sustainable access and the necessity to sustain our investment in innovation platforms to address unmet medical needs. Central to price is the clinical  value  that  this  innovation  brings  to  the  market,  the  current  landscape  of  alternative  treatment  options  and  the  goals  of ensuring appropriate patient access to this innovation and sustaining investment in creative platforms. We continue to explore new pricing approaches to ensure that patients have access to our medicines. Enhancing patient access to medicines is a priority for us. We are  focused  on:  offering  creative  tiered  pricing,  reimbursement  support  and  patient  assistance  programs  to  optimize  access while protecting innovation; advocating for sustainable healthcare policies and infrastructure, leveraging advocacy/payer's input and  utilizing  partnerships  as  appropriate;  and  improving  access  to  care  and  supportive  services  for  vulnerable  patients  through partnerships and demonstration projects.\n\nAn important factor on which the pricing of our medicines depends is government regulation. We have been subject to increasing international and domestic efforts by various governments to implement or strengthen measures to regulate pharmaceutical market access and product pricing and payment. In the U.S., we are required to provide discounts on purchases of pharmaceutical products under various federal and state healthcare programs. Federal government officials and legislators continue to face intense pressure from the public to manage the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals and have responded by pursuing legislation and rules that they claim would further reduce the cost of drugs for the federal government and other stakeholders. We are also now required to comply with recently enacted state laws that seek additional transparency into the cost of prescription drugs. We are monitoring efforts by states to seek additional rebates and limit state spending on drugs in light of budget pressures. These international, federal and state legislative and regulatory developments could create new constraints on our ability to set prices and/or impact our market access in certain areas. For further discussion on the pricing pressure and its risk, refer to 'Part I-Item 1A. Risk Factors-Product, Industry and Operational Risks-Increased pricing pressure and other restrictions in the U.S. and abroad continue to negatively affect our revenues and profit margins.'",

      "answer": "In 2022, Revlimid's distribution was highlighted as being tightly controlled through proprietary REMS programs in the U.S. and mandatory risk-management programs internationally, emphasizing safe and appropriate use. By 2023, the focus had evolved to address looming patent expirations for Revlimid, with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) emphasizing offsetting this impact through a robust pipeline and expansion in hematological malignancies. Specifically, BMY aimed to leverage its leadership in autologous CAR-T cell therapies and expand into new indications to ensure long-term growth.",

          "chunk_text": "## Estimated End-User Demand\n\nPursuant to the SEC Consent Order described under '-SEC Consent Order', we monitor the level of inventory on hand in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel and outside of the U.S. in the direct customer distribution channel. We are obligated to disclose products with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand, subject to a de minimis exception. Estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel in excess of one month on hand for the following products were not material to our results of operations as of the dates indicated.\n\nAbraxane had 1.4 months of inventory on hand internationally in the distribution channel at September 30, 2021 compared to 1.9 months of inventory on hand at June 30, 2021 due to on-going business transition from a distributor and to avert a forecasted back order in Latin America.\n\nIn the U.S., we generally determine our months on hand estimates using inventory levels of product on hand and the amount of outmovement provided by our three largest wholesalers, which account for approximately 76% of total gross sales of U.S. products for the year ended December 31, 2021. Factors that may influence our estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, wholesaler purchases in light of increases in wholesaler list prices, new product launches, new warehouse openings by wholesalers and  new  customer  stockings  by  wholesalers.  In  addition,  these  estimates  are  calculated  using  third-party  data,  which  may  be impacted by their recordkeeping processes.\n\nRevlimid and Pomalyst are  distributed  in  the  U.S.  primarily  through  contracted  pharmacies  under  the  Lenalidomide  REMS  and Pomalyst REMS  programs,  respectively.  These  are  proprietary  risk-management  distribution  programs  tailored  specifically  to provide  for  the  safe  and  appropriate  distribution  and  use  of Revlimid and Pomalyst . Internationally, Revlimid and Imnovid are distributed under mandatory risk-management distribution programs tailored to meet local authorities' specifications to provide for the products' safe and appropriate distribution and use. These programs may vary by country and, depending upon the country and the design of the risk-management program, the product may be sold through hospitals or retail pharmacies.\n\nOur non-U.S. businesses have significantly more direct customers. Information on available direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information varies widely. We limit our direct customer sales channel inventory reporting to where we can influence demand. When this information does not exist or is otherwise not available, we have developed a variety of methodologies to estimate such data, including using historical sales made to direct customers and third-party market research data related to prescription trends and end-user demand. Given the difficulties inherent in estimating third-party demand information, we evaluate our methodologies to estimate direct customer product level inventory  and  to  calculate  months  on  hand  on  an  ongoing  basis  and  make  changes  as  necessary.  Factors  that  may  affect  our estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, price increases, new product launches, new warehouse openings by direct customers, new customer stockings by direct customers and expected direct customer purchases for governmental bidding situations. As such, all of the information required to estimate months on hand in the direct customer distribution channel for nonU.S. business for the year ended December 31, 2021 is not available prior to the filing of this 2021 Form 10-K. We will disclose any product with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand, subject to a de minimis exception, in the next quarterly report on Form 10-Q.\n\n## Expenses\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, Opdivo received multiple regulatory approvals across various indications, including gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, and urothelial carcinoma, which broadened its market reach and reinforced its role as a key immuno-oncology (IO) asset. These approvals positioned Opdivo for continued revenue generation across diverse patient populations. By 2023, the strategic focus shifted toward optimizing Opdivo's commercial impact by expanding into earlier lines of therapy, developing a subcutaneous formulation, and combining it with other agents like Yervoy and novel anti-cancer therapies.

      "answer": "In 2022, Opdivo was approved for several anti-cancer indications including bladder, blood, CRC, head and neck, RCC, HCC, lung, melanoma, MPM, and stomach cancers, with the Opdivo + Yervoy regimen approved in multiple markets for NSCLC, melanoma, MPM, RCC, CRC, and gastric/esophageal cancers. It reported U.S. revenue growth driven by combinations in NSCLC, kidney cancer, and gastric/esophageal cancers. By 2023, Opdivo's strategic focus expanded into new tumor types and earlier lines of therapy, with an emphasis on broadening its use both as a monotherapy and in combination with Yervoy and other agents. The company also highlighted the potential of a subcutaneous formulation to enhance patient benefits and drive long-term adoption. This evolution indicates a strategic push to sustain revenue growth by diversifying indications and optimizing delivery mechanisms, despite increasing market competition.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Opdivo was approved across multiple tumor types, and its revenue growth was driven by key combination therapies in NSCLC, kidney cancer, and gastric/esophageal cancers.",
        "Step 2: By 2023, the company emphasized expanding Opdivo into earlier lines of therapy, new tumor types, and next-generation delivery methods like subcutaneous formulation, while continuing to leverage combination therapies.",
        "Step 3: The evolution from a broad but relatively static portfolio of indications in 2022 to a more dynamic and forward-looking strategy in 2023 suggests a deliberate effort to maintain commercial relevance and drive sustained revenue growth."

          "chunk_text": "Opdivo (nivolumab) - a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 on T and NKT cells that has been approved for several anti-cancer indications including bladder, blood, CRC, head and neck, RCC, HCC, lung, melanoma, MPM and stomach. The Opdivo + Yervoy regimen also is approved in multiple markets for the treatment of NSCLC, melanoma, MPM, RCC, CRC and various gastric and esophageal cancers. There are several ongoing potentially registrational studies for Opdivo across other tumor types and disease areas, in monotherapy and in combination with Yervoy and various anti-cancer agents.\n\n- U.S.  revenues  increased  7%  in  2021  due  to  higher  demand  across  multiple  therapies  including  the Opdivo + Yervoy combinations  in  NSCLC, Opdivo + CABOMETYX *  combination  in  kidney  cancer  and Opdivo in  various  gastric  and esophageal cancers and higher average net selling prices, partially offset by declining second-line eligibility across tumor indications and increased competition.\n- International revenues increased 9% in 2021 due to higher demand and foreign exchange impacts of 2%, partially offset by lower average net selling prices. Excluding foreign exchange impacts, revenues increased by 7%.\n\nPomalyst/Imnovid (pomalidomide) - a proprietary, distinct, small molecule that is administered orally and modulates the immune system  and  other  biologically  important  targets. Pomalyst/Imnovid is  indicated  for  patients  with  multiple  myeloma  who  have received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor and have demonstrated disease progression on or within 60 days of completion of the last therapy.\n\n- U.S. revenues increased 5% in 2021 due to higher average net selling prices and higher demand.\n- International revenues increased 16% in 2021 due to higher demand and foreign exchange impacts of 2% partially offset by lower average net selling prices. Excluding foreign exchange impacts, revenues increased by 14%.\n\nOrencia (abatacept) - a fusion protein indicated for adult patients with moderately to severely active RA and PsA and is also indicated for reducing signs and symptoms in certain pediatric patients with moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA.\n\n- U.S. revenues increased 6% in 2021 due to higher demand.\n- International  revenues  remained  consistent  in  2021  due  to  foreign  exchange  impacts  of  2%,  offset  by  lower  demand. Excluding foreign exchange impacts, revenues decreased by 1%.\n- In the U.S. and EU, estimated minimum market exclusivity dates were previously based on method of use patents that expired in 2021. Formulation and additional patents expire in 2026 and beyond. There are no Orencia biosimilars on the market in the U.S., EU or Japan.\n\nSprycel (dasatinib) - an oral inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinase indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML in chronic phase and the treatment of adults with chronic, accelerated, or myeloid or lymphoid blast phase CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy, including Gleevec* (imatinib mesylate) and the treatment of children and adolescents aged 1 year to 18 years with chronic phase Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML.\n\n- U.S. revenues remained consistent in 2021 due to higher demand offset by lower average net selling prices.\n- International revenues decreased 3% in 2021 due to lower demand as a result of increased generic competition in certain indications and lower average net selling prices, partially offset by foreign exchange impacts of 1%. Excluding foreign exchange impacts, revenues decreased by 4%.\n\nYervoy (ipilimumab)  -  a  monoclonal  antibody  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  unresectable  or  metastatic  melanoma.  The Opdivo + Yervoy regimen also is approved in multiple markets for the treatment of NSCLC, melanoma, MPM, RCC, and CRC.\n\n- U.S. revenues increased 13% in 2021 due to higher demand primarily from the Opdivo + Yervoy combination for NSCLC and higher average net selling prices.\n- International revenues increased 36% in 2021 due to higher demand and foreign exchange impacts of 2% partially offset by lower average net selling prices. Excluding foreign exchange impacts, revenues increased by 34%.",

However, in 2023, the disclosure no longer included any mention of these milestone obligations, suggesting that either all milestones were resolved or the structure of the agreement changed. The royalty structure on net sales remained in place, as noted in both years, but the absence of milestone details in 2023 indicates a material change in the financial terms of the collaboration.",

Incyte has the right to receive tiered, double digit royalty payments on worldwide net sales with rates ranging up to 20 percent. The agreement calls for payments by us to Incyte associated with certain development, success-based regulatory, and sales-based milestones. In 2020, the agreement was amended to include the treatment of COVID-19, with Incyte obtaining the right to receive an additional royalty ranging up to the low teens on worldwide net sales for the treatment of COVID-19 that exceed a specified aggregate worldwide net sales threshold.\n\nIn connection with the regulatory approvals of Olumiant in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, as well as achievement of a sales-based milestone, milestone payments of $260.0 million and $210.0 million were capitalized as intangible assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are being amortized to cost of sales through the term of the collaboration. This represents the cumulative amounts that have been capitalized from the start of this collaboration through the end of each reporting period.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, Incyte is eligible to receive up to $100.0 million of additional payments from us contingent upon certain success-based regulatory milestones. Incyte is also eligible to receive up to $100.0 million of potential sales-based milestones.\n\nWe record our sales of Olumiant, including sales of baricitinib that were made pursuant to an EUA or similar regulatory authorizations, to third parties as net product revenue with the royalty payments made to Incyte recorded as cost of sales.

        "Step 1: In 2022, Lebrikizumab was an investigational drug with Fast Track designation from the FDA, indicating early-stage regulatory engagement.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, Lebrikizumab received formal regulatory approvals in the EU and Japan, faced a regulatory hurdle in the U.S. with a Complete Response Letter, and remains under review with expected action by the end of 2024.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a transformation in the regulatory status of Lebrikizumab, moving from an investigational compound to a near-market or market-ready therapeutic with regional approvals and ongoing U.S. evaluation."

      "question": "How has CVS's approach to Medication Management evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of clinical programs and digital tools aimed at improving medication adherence and cost efficiency?",
      "answer": "In 2022, CVS emphasized formulary management through its National Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee, promoting the use of generic drugs and offering real-time benefit information to guide members toward lower-cost alternatives. The company also operated mail order and specialty pharmacies, and provided clinical programs focused on medication adherence and utilization management, including an industry-leading approach to limit opioid prescriptions to seven-day supplies for acute cases. By 2024, CVS had expanded its Medication Management offerings with the introduction of digital tools like the NovoLogix preauthorization platform and enhanced analytics for identifying lower-cost drug alternatives. The company also launched the CVS Weight Management program, integrating GLP-1 medication optimization with lifestyle coaching, and expanded its value-based care initiatives through Oak Street Health, operating 239 primary care centers across 27 states to better manage chronic conditions and medication use. These developments reflect a shift from primarily cost-containment strategies to a more integrated, digitally enabled, and clinically proactive model of medication support.",

Clients also have the option, through plan design, to further lower their pharmacy benefit plan costs by setting different member payment levels for different products on their drug lists or 'formularies,' which helps guide members to choose lower cost alternatives through appropriate financial incentives.\n\n## Formulary Management\n\nThe Company utilizes an independent panel of doctors, pharmacists and other medical experts, referred to as the CVS Caremark National Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee, to review and approve the selection of drugs that meet the Company's standards of safety and efficacy for inclusion on one of the Company's template formularies. The Company's formularies provide recommended products in numerous drug classes to help ensure member access to clinically appropriate drugs with alternatives within a class under the client's pharmacy benefit plan, while helping to drive the lowest net cost for clients that select one of the Company's formularies. To help improve clinical outcomes for members and clients, the Company conducts ongoing, independent reviews of all drugs, including those appearing on the formularies and generic equivalent products. Many of the Company's clients choose to adopt a template formulary offering as part of their plan design. PBM clients are given capabilities to offer real time benefits information for a member's specific plan design, provided digitally at the point of prescribing, at the CVS pharmacy and directly to members.\n\n## Retail Pharmacy Network Management Services\n\nThe Company maintains a national network of approximately 66,000 retail pharmacies, consisting of approximately 40,000 chain pharmacies (which includes CVS Pharmacy locations) and approximately 26,000 independent pharmacies, in the United States, including Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. When a customer fills a prescription in a retail pharmacy, the pharmacy sends prescription data electronically to the Company from the point-of-sale. This data interfaces with the Company's proprietary prescription management systems, which verify relevant plan member data and eligibility, while also performing a drug utilization review to help evaluate clinical appropriateness and safety and confirming that the pharmacy will receive payment for the prescription. The Company also offers a performance program for non-Medicare customers, which can be implemented with either the Company's broad, national network or with any managed network (as allowed by applicable laws and regulations). Under the program, high performing pharmacies are eligible to receive an incremental positive performance payment. The program aligns with key Healthcare Effectiveness Data Information Set measures utilized by CMS and is funded by client fees.\n\n## Mail Order Pharmacy Services\n\nThe Pharmacy Services segment operates mail order dispensing pharmacies in the United States. Plan members or their prescribers submit prescriptions or refill requests, primarily for maintenance medications, to these pharmacies, and staff pharmacists review these prescriptions and refill requests with the assistance of the Company's prescription management systems. This review may involve communications with the prescriber and, with the prescriber's approval when required, can result in generic substitution, therapeutic interchange or other actions designed to help reduce cost and/or improve quality of treatment. The Company's mail order dispensing pharmacies have been awarded Mail Service Pharmacy accreditation from URAC.\n\n## Specialty Pharmacy and Infusion Services\n\nThe Pharmacy Services segment operates specialty mail order pharmacies, retail specialty pharmacy stores and branches for infusion and enteral nutrition services in the United States. The specialty mail order pharmacies are used for delivery of advanced medications to individuals with chronic or genetic diseases and disorders. The Company's specialty mail order pharmacies have been awarded Specialty Pharmacy accreditation from URAC. Substantially all of the Company's specialty mail order pharmacies also have been accredited by The Joint Commission and the Accreditation Commission for Health Care ('ACHC'), which are independent, not-for-profit organizations that accredit and certify health care programs and organizations in the United States. The ACHC accreditation includes an additional accreditation by the Pharmacy Compounding Accreditation Board, which certifies compliance with the highest level of pharmacy compounding standards.\n\n## Clinical Services\n\nThe Company offers multiple clinical programs and services to help clients manage overall pharmacy and health care costs in a clinically appropriate manner. These programs are primarily designed to promote better health outcomes and to help target inappropriate medication utilization and non-adherence to medication, each of which may result in adverse medical events that negatively affect member health and client pharmacy and medical spend. These programs include utilization management ('UM'), medication management, quality assurance, adherence and counseling programs to complement the client's plan design and clinical strategies. To help address prescription opioid abuse and misuse, the Company introduced an industry-leading UM approach that limits to seven days the supply of opioids dispensed for certain acute prescriptions for patients who",

These programs include utilization management ('UM'), medication management, quality assurance, adherence and counseling programs to complement the client's plan design and clinical strategies. The Company offers an integrated strategy that aims to help decrease the potential for inappropriate opioid use while preserving access for those with genuine chronic pain needs through concurrent and retrospective claims' review. In addition, this strategy aims to address potential fraud, waste, and abuse across multiple drug classes through surveillance and communications to prescribers and pharmacies. Core medication support products such as Pharmacy Advisor and Drug Savings Review optimize utilization through digital, phone, inperson, and provider-facing outreach to help participating plan members with certain chronic diseases to identify gaps in care, adhere to their prescribed medications, ensure efficient use of those medications, and manage their overall health conditions. The CVS Weight Management program optimizes utilization of GLP-1 medication and provides the label-recommended lifestyle support and coaching to maximize and maintain weight loss on these therapies, while addressing new indications (e.g., cardiovascular disease). The Company also has digital connectivity that helps to lower drug costs for patients by providing expanded visibility to lower cost alternatives through enhanced analytics and data sharing.\n\n## Disease Management Programs\n\nThe Company's clinical programs and services utilize advanced protocols and offer clients convenience in working with providers and other third parties. The Company's care management program covers diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy and multiple sclerosis and is accredited by the NCQA. The Company's UM program covers similar diseases and is accredited by the NCQA and URAC.\n\n## Medical Benefit Management\n\nThe Company's NovoLogix online preauthorization tool helps identify and capture cost savings opportunities for specialty drugs billed under the medical benefit by identifying outliers to appropriate dosages and costs, and helps to ensure clinically appropriate use of specialty drugs. \u00ae\n\n## Group Purchasing Organization Services\n\nThe Company operates a group purchasing organization that negotiates pricing for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and rebates with pharmaceutical manufacturers on behalf of its participants. The Company also provides various administrative, management and reporting services to pharmaceutical manufacturers.\n\n## Value-Based Care\n\nIn response to rising healthcare spending in the U.S., commercial, government and other payors are shifting away from fee-for-service payment models towards value-based models, including risk-based payment models that tie financial incentives to quality, efficiency and coordination of care. Value-based care ('VBC') refers to the goal of incentivizing healthcare providers to simultaneously increase quality while lowering the cost of care for patients. More specifically, providers in a VBC model are incentivized to focus on more preventative care, higher quality of care and better coordination of care to create better health outcomes and avoid potentially ex pensive complications from illnesses that could be managed more conveniently and cost effectively.\n\nThe Company is committed to expanding value-based care in the U.S. and delivering higher quality care to patients at a lower overall cost to the industry. The Company operates in value-based care through two primary means: providing comprehensive primary care through its Oak Street Health primary care centers and enabling independent health systems transition to value-based care through contracting and care management services. The Company's value-based care assets typically contract with payors, primarily Medicare Advantage plans, and/or CMS.\n\nThe Company's Oak Street Health business operates retail-like, community-based centers that provide medical primary care services and support Medicare eligible patients in the management of chronic illnesses and the prevention of unnecessary acute events. The Company integrates population health analytics, social support services and primary care into the care model to drive improved patient outcomes. The Company contracts with health plans and CMS to generate medical costs savings, assume full financial risk of its patients and realize a return on its investment in primary care.\n\nThe Company's clinics implement a branded and consumer-focused design to create a welcoming environment that engages patients in highly accessible, convenient locations close to where patients live, work and shop. As of December 31, 2024, the Company operated 239 centers across 27 states. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company's centers provided care for approximately 500,000 patients.\n\nIn addition to its primary care centers, the Company provides enablement services to independent health systems, assisting these groups with their transition to value-based care. The Company's customers practice value-based care primarily through",

      "answer": "In 2022, new prescription drugs were characterized as a risk factor for CVS's specialty pharmacy business, with the company noting that a reduction in demand for dispensed prescriptions could have an 'adverse effect' on its business and cash flows. The emphasis was on the vulnerability of the business to contractions in patient base or prescription utilization. By 2024, the narrative shifted to a strategic dependency, where access to key drugs and penetration in treatment categories became a 'critical' factor for future growth. This evolution indicates that while new drugs were seen as a potential financial threat in 2022, by 2024, their availability had become a necessary enabler for revenue expansion in the specialty pharmacy segment, which represents a significant and growing proportion of U.S. prescription drug spending.",

          "chunk_text": "specialty pharmacy business depends largely upon expanding our access to key drugs and penetration in certain treatment categories. Any contraction of our base of patients or reduction in demand for the prescriptions we currently dispense could have an adverse effect on our specialty pharmacy business, operating results and cash flows.\n\n## We face risks relating to the availability, pricing and safety profiles of prescription drugs that we purchase and sell.\n\nThe profitability of our Retail/LTC and Pharmacy Services segments is dependent upon the utilization of prescription drug products. We dispense significant volumes of brand name and generic drugs from our retail, LTC, specialty and mail order pharmacies, and the retail pharmacies in our PBM's network also dispense significant volumes of brand name and generic drugs. Our revenues, operating results and cash flows may decline if physicians cease writing prescriptions for drugs or the utilization of drugs is reduced, including due to:\n\n- increased safety risk profiles or regulatory restrictions;\n- manufacturing or other supply issues;\n- a reduction in drug manufacturers' participation in federal programs;\n- certain products being withdrawn by their manufacturers or transitioned to over-the-counter products;\n- future FDA rulings restricting the supply or increasing the cost of products;\n- the introduction of new and successful prescription drugs or lower-priced generic alternatives to existing brand name products; or\n- inflation in the price of drugs.\n\nIn addition, increased utilization of generic drugs (which normally yield a higher gross profit rate than equivalent brand name drugs) has resulted in pressure to decrease reimbursement payments to retail, mail order, specialty and LTC pharmacies for generic drugs, causing a reduction in our margins on sales of generic drugs. Consolidation within the generic drug manufacturing industry and other external factors may enhance the ability of manufacturers to sustain or increase pricing of generic drugs and diminish our ability to negotiate reduced generic drug acquisition costs. Any inability to offset increased brand name or generic prescription drug acquisition costs or to modify our activities to lessen the financial impact of such increased costs could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results.\n\nThe reserves we hold for expected claims in our Insured Health Care Benefits products are based on estimates that involve an extensive degree of judgment and are inherently variable. Any reserve, including a premium deficiency reserve, may be insufficient. If actual claims exceed our estimates, our operating results could be materially adversely affected, and our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future costs may be limited.\n\nA large portion of health care claims are not submitted to us until after the end of the quarter in which services are rendered by providers to our members. Our reported health care costs payable for any particular period reflect our estimates of the ultimate cost of such claims as well as claims that have been reported to us but not yet paid. We also must estimate the amount of rebates payable under the MLR rules of the ACA, CMS and the OPM and the amounts payable by us to, and receivable by us from, the United States federal government under the ACA's remaining premium stabilization program.\n\nOur estimates of health care costs payable are based on a number of factors, including those derived from historical claim experience, but this estimation process also makes use of extensive judgment. Considerable variability is inherent in such estimates, and the accuracy of the estimates is highly sensitive to changes in medical claims submission and processing patterns and/or procedures, turnover and other changes in membership, changes in product mix, changes in the utilization of medical and/or other covered services, including prescription drugs, changes in medical cost trends, changes in our medical management practices and the introduction of new benefits and products. We estimate health care costs payable periodically, and any resulting adjustments, including premium deficiency reserves, are reflected in current-period operating results within benefit costs. For example, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we established a premium deficiency reserve of $16 million and $11 million, respectively, related to Medicaid products in the Health Care Benefits segment. A worsening (or improvement) of health care cost trend rates or changes in claim payment patterns from those that we assumed in estimating health care costs payable as of December 31, 2021 would cause these estimates to change in the near term, and such a change could be material.\n\nFurthermore, if we are not able to accurately and promptly anticipate and detect medical cost trends or accurately estimate the cost of incurred but not yet reported claims or reported claims that have not been paid, our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future health care costs and reflect our current benefit cost experience in our pricing process may be limited, which would further exacerbate the extent of any adverse impact on our operating results. These risks are particularly acute during and following periods when utilization of medical and/or other covered services and/or medical cost trends are below",

Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer preferences, spending patterns and evolving demographic mixes in the communities we serve, including shifts toward online shopping, or failure to maintain desirable selections of merchandise, store environments or guests experiences could adversely affect our relationship with our customers and clients and the demand for our products and services and could result in excess inventories of products.\n\nWe offer our retail customers proprietary brand products that are available exclusively at our retail stores and through our online retail sites. The sale of proprietary products subjects us to unique risks including potential product liability risks, mandatory or voluntary product recalls, potential supply chain and distribution chain disruptions for raw materials and finished products, our ability to successfully protect our intellectual property rights and the rights of applicable third parties, and other risks generally encountered by entities that source, market and sell private-label products. We also face similar risks for the other products we sell in our retail operations, including supply chain and distribution chain disruption risk. Any failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have an adverse effect on our retail business, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition. Additionally, an increase in the sales of our proprietary brands may adversely affect our sales of products owned by our suppliers and adversely impact certain of our supplier relationships. Our ability to locate qualified, economically stable suppliers who satisfy our requirements, and to acquire sufficient products in a timely and effective manner, is critical to ensuring, among other things, that customer confidence is not diminished. Any failure to develop sourcing relationships with a broad and deep supplier base could adversely affect our operating results and erode customer loyalty.\n\nWe also could be adversely affected if we fail to identify or effectively respond to changes in marketplace dynamics. For example, specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the U.S., a significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacies. Because our specialty pharmacy business focuses on complex and high-cost medications, many of which are made available by manufacturers to a limited number of pharmacies (so-called limited distribution drugs) that serve a relatively limited universe of patients, the future growth of our specialty pharmacy business depends largely upon expanding our access to key drugs and penetration in certain treatment categories. Any contraction of our base of patients or reduction in demand for the prescriptions we currently dispense could have an adverse effect on our specialty pharmacy business, operating results and cash flows.\n\n## We face risks relating to the availability, pricing and safety profiles of prescription drugs that we purchase and sell.\n\nThe profitability of our Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness and Health Services segments is dependent upon the utilization of prescription drug products.

The Company offers a broad range of traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, many of which are available nationwide. Depending on the product, the Company markets to a range of customers including employer groups, individuals, college students, part-time and hourly workers, health plans, providers, governmental units, government-sponsored plans, labor groups and expatriates. For additional information on medical membership, see 'Health Care Benefits Segment' in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (the 'MD&amp;A') included in Item 7 of this 10-K.\n\nThe Company markets both Commercial Insured and ASC products and services primarily to employers that sponsor the Company's products for the benefit of their employees and their employees' dependents. Frequently, larger employers offer employees a choice among coverage options, from which the employee makes his or her selection during a designated annual open enrollment period. Typically, employers pay all of the monthly premiums to the Company and, through payroll deductions, obtain reimbursement from employees for a percentage of the premiums that is determined by each employer. Some Health Care Benefits products are sold directly to employees of employer groups on a fully employee-funded basis. In some cases, the Company bills the covered individual directly. In addition, effective January 2022, the Company entered the individual public health insurance exchanges ('Public Exchanges') in eight states through which it sells Insured plans directly to individual consumers.\n\nThe Company offers Insured Medicare coverage on an individual basis as well as through employer groups to their retirees. Medicaid and CHIP members are enrolled on an individual basis. The Company also offers Insured health care coverage to members who are dually-eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nHealth Care Benefits products are sold through: the Company's sales personnel; independent brokers, agents and consultants who assist in the production and servicing of business; as well as private health insurance exchanges ('Private Exchanges') and Public Exchanges (together with Private Exchanges, 'Insurance Exchanges'). For large employers or other entities that sponsor the Company's products ('plan sponsors'), independent consultants and brokers are frequently involved in employer health plan selection decisions and sales. In some instances, the Company may pay commissions, fees and other amounts to brokers, agents, consultants and sales representatives who place business with the Company. In certain cases, the customer pays the broker for services rendered, and the Company may facilitate that arrangement by collecting the funds from the customer and transmitting them to the broker. The Company supports marketing and sales efforts with an advertising program that may include television, radio, billboards, print media and social media, supplemented by market research and direct marketing efforts.\n\nThe U.S. federal government is a significant customer of the Health Care Benefits segment through contracts with CMS for coverage of Medicare-eligible individuals and federal employee-related benefit programs. Other than the contracts with CMS, the Health Care Benefits segment is not dependent upon a single customer or a few customers the loss of which would have a significant effect on the earnings of the segment. The loss of business from any one, or a few, independent brokers or agents would not have a material adverse effect on the earnings of the Health Care Benefits segment. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, Health Care Benefits segment revenues from the federal government accounted for 14%, 13% and 13%, respectively, of the Company's consolidated total revenues. Contracts with CMS for coverage of Medicare-eligible individuals in the Health Care Benefits segment accounted for approximately 79%, 78% and 76%, respectively, of the Company's consolidated revenues from the federal government in 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\n## Health Care Benefits Pricing\n\nFor Commercial Insured plans, contracts containing the pricing and other terms of the relationship are generally established in advance of the policy period and typically have a duration of one year. Fees under ASC plans are generally fixed for a period of one year.\n\nGenerally, a fixed premium rate is determined at the beginning of the policy period for Commercial Insured plans. The Company typically cannot recover unanticipated increases in health care and other benefit costs in the current policy period; however, it may consider prior experience for a product in the aggregate or for a specific customer, among other factors, in",

The loss of business from any one or a few independent brokers or agents would not have a material adverse effect on the earnings of the Health Care Benefits segment. Health Care Benefits segment revenues from the federal government accounted for 18% of the Company's consolidated total revenues in 2024, 2023 and 2022. Contracts with CMS for coverage of Medicare-eligible individuals in the Health Care Benefits segment accounted for approximately 74%, 73% and 74%, respectively, of the Company's consolidated revenues from the federal government in 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## Health Care Benefits Pricing\n\nFor Commercial Insured plans, contracts containing the pricing and other terms of the relationship are generally established in advance of the policy period and typically have a duration of one year. Fees under ASC plans are generally fixed for a period of one year.\n\nGenerally, a fix ed premium rate is determined at the beginning of the policy period for Commercial Insured plans. The Company typically cannot recover unanticipated increases in health care and other benefit costs in the current policy period; however, it may consider prior experience for a product in the aggregate or for a specific customer, among other factors, in determining premium rates for future policy periods. Where required by state laws, premium rates are filed and approved by state regulators prior to contract inception. Future operating results could be adversely affected if the premium rates requested are not approved or are adjusted downward or their approval is delayed by state or federal regulators.\n\nThe Company has Medicare Advantage and PDP contracts with CMS to provide HMO, PPO and prescription drug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries in certain geographic areas. Under these annual contracts, CMS pays the Company a fixed per member (or 'capitation') payment and/or a portion of the premium, both of which are based on membership and adjusted for demographic and health risk factors. CMS also considers inflation, changes in utilization patterns and average per capita fee-for-service Medicare costs in the calculation of the fix ed capitation payment or premium. PDP contracts also provide a risk-sharing arrangement with CMS to limit the Company's exposure to unfavorable expenses or benefit from favorable expenses. Amounts payable to the Company under the Medicare arrangements are subject to annual revision by CMS, and the Company elects to participate in each Medicare service area or region on an annual basis. Premiums paid to the Company for Medicare products are subject to federal government reviews and audits, which can result, and have resulted, in retroactive and prospective premium adjustments and refunds to the government and/or members. In addition to payments received from CMS, some Medicare Advantage products and all PDP products require a supplemental premium to be paid by the member or sponsoring employer. In some cases, these supplemental premiums are adjusted based on the member's income and asset levels. Compared to Commercial Medical products, Medicare contracts generate higher per member per month revenues and higher health care and other benefit costs.\n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the 'ACA') ties a portion of each Medicare Advantage plan's reimbursement to the plan's 'star ratings.' Plans must have a star rating of 4 or higher (out of 5) to qualify for bonus payments. CMS released the Company's 2025 star ratings in October 2024. The Company's 2025 star ratings will be used to determine which of the Company's Medicare Advantage plans have ratings of four stars or higher and qualify for bonus payments in 2026. Based on the Company's membership at December 31, 2024, 88% of the Company's Medicare Advantage members were in plans with 2025 star ratings of at least 4.0 stars, compared to 91% of the Company's Medicare Advantage members being in plans with 2024 star ratings of at least 4.0 stars based on the Company's membership at December 31, 2023.",

      "question": "How has CVS's disclosure regarding the use of broker quoted debt securities in its fair value measurements evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of its presence or impact on financial reporting?",
      "answer": "In 2022, CVS explicitly stated that it did not have any broker quoted debt securities for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, and that it only used internal pricing for certain private placements. By 2024, the company continued to disclose that it had no broker quoted debt securities for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, indicating a consistent absence of such securities in its portfolio. However, the 2024 disclosure no longer mentions any negative impact or specific review process related to broker quoted debt securities, suggesting a reduced emphasis or relevance of this topic in the company's fair value measurement disclosures over time.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, CVS disclosed it did not have any broker quoted debt securities for 2021 and 2020 and noted that it used internal pricing for private placements; it also described a detailed review process for Level 2 debt securities.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, CVS again stated it had no broker quoted debt securities for 2023 and 2024 but omitted any mention of a negative impact or review process related to broker quoted debt securities.",
        "Step 3: The change indicates a shift in how the company communicates about broker quoted debt securities\u2014from a negatively impacting factor in 2022 to a neutral, non-impact disclosure in 2024, reflecting a reduced emphasis or relevance in its fair value measurement process."

      "answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group reported that unrealized losses in its available-for-sale debt securities were primarily driven by interest rate increases and not credit deterioration, with no significant credit deterioration observed since purchase. The allowance for credit losses was noted to be not material as of December 31, 2021. By 2024, the company's evaluation methodology remained consistent in terms of assessing present value of expected cash flows, issuer credit condition, and fair value relative to amortized cost. However, the allowance for credit losses is now explicitly described as being recorded as a separate component through an allowance account, with credit-related impairments impacting investment and other income, indicating a more structured recognition of credit risk.

The Company believes it will collect the timely principal and interest due on its debt securities having an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities which impacted the Company's assessment on collectability of principal and interest. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates available-for-sale debt securities for any credit-related impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the expected cash flows, the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers noting no significant credit deterioration since purchase. As of December 31, 2021, the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary.

For the most recent two months, the Company estimates claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data are available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors (actuarial estimates, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period adjudicated by the Company at the date of estimation). For months prior to the most recent two months, the Company applies the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months.\n\n## Cost of Products Sold\n\nThe Company's cost of products sold includes the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed to unaffiliated customers either directly at its home delivery, specialty and community pharmacy locations, or indirectly through its nationwide network of participating pharmacies. Rebates attributable to unaffiliated clients are accrued as rebates receivable and a reduction of cost of products sold, with a corresponding payable for the amounts of the rebates to be remitted to those unaffiliated clients in accordance with their contracts and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction of product revenue. Cost of products sold also includes the cost of personnel to support the Company's transaction processing services, system sales, maintenance and professional services.\n\n## Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments\n\nCash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments having an original maturity of three months or less. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value because of the short maturity of the instruments. Investments with maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term. Because of regulatory requirements, certain investments are included in long-term investments regardless of their maturity date. The Company classifies these investments as held-to-maturity and reports them at amortized cost. Substantially all other investments are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value based on quoted market prices, where available. Equity investments are measured at fair value, with certain exceptions where the Company has elected to measure investments with unobservable inputs at cost, subject to fair value adjustments upon an impairment or a transaction of the same or similar security. Changes in fair value of equity investments are recognized in net earnings.\n\nThe Company excludes unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities from net earnings and reports them as comprehensive income and, net of income tax effects, as a separate component of equity. To calculate realized gains and losses on the sale of debt securities, the Company specifically identifies the cost of each investment sold.\n\nThe Company evaluates an available-for-sale debt security for credit-related impairment by considering the present value of expected cash flows relative to a security's amortized cost, the ex tent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and specific events or circumstances which may influence the operations of the issuer. Credit-related impairments are recorded as an allowance, with an offset to investment and other income. Non-credit related impairments are recorded through other comprehensive income. If the Company intends to sell an impaired security, or will likely be required to sell a security before recovery of the entire amortized cost, the entire impairment is included in net earnings.\n\nNew information and the passage of time can change these judgments. The Company manages its investment portfolio to limit its exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limits its investments to investment grade quality.\n\n## Assets Under Management\n\nIn July 2024, the Company amended its Medicare Supplement Program with a membership organization (the Medicare Supplement Program). The amendments provide the Company the right to use a trade name and other intellectual property in marketing efforts for Medicare Supplement offerings. Amounts previously reported as assets under management are now included within the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet based upon their classification.\n\nFor periods prior to the amended Medicare Supplement Program, the Company excluded the effects of certain balance sheet amounts in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, while these effects are included for periods after the amendments.\n\n## Other Current Receivables\n\nOther current receivables include amounts due from pharmaceutical manufacturers for rebates and Medicare Part D drug discounts, loans to care providers in response to the Change Healthcare cyberattack, accrued interest and other miscellaneous amounts due to the Company.",

These matters have included or could in the future include matters related to health care benefits coverage and payment claims (including disputes with enrollees, customers and contracted and non-contracted physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals), tort claims (including claims related to the delivery of health care services, such as medical malpractice by staff at our affiliates' facilities, or by health care practitioners who are employed by us, have contractual relationships with us, or serve as providers to our managed care networks, including as a result of a failure to adhere to applicable clinical, quality and/or patient safety standards), antitrust claims (including as a result of changes in the enforcement of antitrust laws), whistleblower claims (including claims under the False Claims Act or similar statutes), contract and labor disputes, tax claims and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices. In addition, certain of our pharmacy services operations are subject to the clinical quality, patient safety and other risks inherent in the dispensing, packaging and distribution of drugs, including claims related to purported dispensing and other operational errors. We may also be party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups and consumers. We operate in jurisdictions outside of the United States where contractual rights, tax positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the United States, and therefore subject to dispute by customers, government authorities or others. Any failure by us to adhere to the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could subject us to civil and criminal penalties.\n\nWe are largely self-insured with regard to litigation risks, including claims of medical malpractice against our affiliated physicians and us. Although we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self-insured matters, it is possible the level of actual losses will significantly exceed the liabilities recorded. Additionally, physicians and other healthcare providers have become subject to an increasing number of legal actions alleging medical malpractice and general professional liabilities. Even in states that have imposed caps on damages for such actions, litigants are seeking recoveries under new theories of liability that might not be subject to the caps on damages. Many of these actions involve large claims and significant defense costs and, if these actions are asserted against us, could result in substantial monetary damages or damage to our reputation.\n\nWe cannot predict the outcome of significant legal actions in which we are involved and are incurring expenses in resolving these matters. The legal actions we face or may face in the future could further increase our cost of doing business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, certain legal actions could result in adverse publicity which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our ability to retain our current business or grow our market share in some markets and businesses.\n\nAny failure by us to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete, manage or integrate acquisitions and other significant strategic transactions or relationships domestically or outside the United States could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nAs part of our business strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, divestitures, strategic alliances, joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions. For example, we have a strategic alliance with AARP under which we provide AARP-branded Medicare Supplement insurance to AARP members and other AARP-branded products and services to Medicare beneficiaries. If we fail to meet the needs of our alliance or joint venture partners, including by developing additional products and services, providing high levels of service, pricing our products and services competitively or responding effectively to applicable federal and state regulatory changes, our alliances and joint ventures could be damaged or terminated which in turn could adversely impact our reputation, business and results of operations. Further, if we fail to identify and successfully complete transactions, which further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\n\nSuccess in completing acquisitions is also dependent on effectively integrating the acquired business into our existing operations, including our internal control environment and culture, or otherwise leveraging its operations which may present challenges different from those presented by organic growth and may be difficult for us to manage. In addition, even with appropriate diligence, pre-acquisition practices of an acquired business may expose us to legal challenges and investigations. For example, in January 2021, an indictment for alleged violations of antitrust laws was issued by the DOJ against our subsidiary, Surgical Care Affiliates (SCA), based on conduct alleged to have begun more than five years prior to our acquisition. We are vigorously defending this lawsuit, but if SCA is found liable, we may be subject to criminal fines or reputational harm. If we cannot successfully integrate these acquisitions and realize contemplated revenue growth opportunities",

The physicians who practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organizations could terminate their provider contracts or otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with us. We face and will likely continue to face heightened competition to acquire or manage physician practices or to employ or contract with individual physicians. Our revenues could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to maintain or expand satisfactory relationships with physicians, to acquire, recruit or, in some instances, employ physicians, or to retain enrollees following physician departures. In addition, our affiliated physician organizations contract with competitors of UnitedHealthcare. Our businesses could suffer if our affiliated physician organizations fail to maintain relationships with or fail to adequately price their contracts with these third-party payer competitors.\n\nFurther, physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and certain health care providers are customers of our Optum businesses. Physicians also provide medical services at facilities owned by our Optum businesses. Given the importance of health care providers and other constituents to our businesses, failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\n## If we fail to compete effectiv ely to maintain or increase our market share, including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nOur businesses face significant competition in all of the markets in which we operate. In many geographies or product segments, our competitors have and may continue to have certain competitive advantages. Our competitive position may also be adversely affected by significant merger and acquisition activity in the industries in which we operate, among both our competitors and suppliers. Consolidation among competitors may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase our customer base, maintain or improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers, or maintain or increase our profitability.\n\nIn addition, our success in the health care marketplace and future growth depends on our ability to develop and deliver innovative and potentially disruptive products and services to satisfy evolving market demands. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services which are useful and relevant to health care payers, consumers and our customers, we may not remain competitive and risk losing market share to existing competitors and disruptive new market entrants. We may face risks from new technologies and market entrants which could affect our existing relationship with health plan enrollees in the affected markets. We could sustain competitive disadvantages and loss of market share if we fail to continue developing innovative care models, including by accelerating the transition of care to value-based models that achieve higher quality outcomes and better experiences at lower costs and expand access to virtual and in-home care. If health care payers or providers are unwilling or unable to enter into value-based agreements with us, we may be unable to successfully establish or maintain the contractual or employment relationships necessary to achieve the quality and cost objectives we have for value-based contracting. Additionally, our competitive position could be adversely affected by any failure to develop and apply innovative technologies and other effective data and analytics capabilities or to provide services to our clients focused on these technologies and capabilities.\n\nOur business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows also could be materially and adversely affected if we do not compete effectively in our markets, if our reputation suffers harm, if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets, if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services demonstrating value to our customers, if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services, if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect or declines, or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products.\n\n## We are routinely subject to various private party and governmental legal actions and investigations, which could damage our reputation and, if resolved unfavorably, could result in substantial penalties or monetary damages and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nWe are routinely made party to a variety of private party and governmental legal actions and investigations related to, among other matters, the design, management and delivery of our product and service offerings. Any failure by us to adhere to the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could subject us to civil and criminal penalties.\n\nLegal actions to which we are a party have included and in the future could include matters related to health care benefits coverage and payment of claims (including disputes with enrollees, customers and contracted and non-contracted physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals), tort claims (including claims related to the delivery of health care services, such as medical malpractice by personnel at our affiliates' facilities, or by health care practitioners who are employed by us, have contractual relationships with us, or serve as providers to our managed care networks, including as a result of a failure to adhere to applicable clinical, quality and/or patient safety standards), antitrust claims (including as a result of changes in the",

      "question": "How has UnitedHealth Group's legal framing of its ownership and use of the Optum trademark evolved between its 2022 and 2024 10-K filings, and what does this suggest about the brand's strategic positioning?",
      "answer": "In the 2022 10-K filing, UnitedHealth Group explicitly stated that it 'owns' the Optum trademark, emphasizing a direct and legally assertive stance regarding its intellectual property rights. This framing positioned Optum as a protected and integral part of the company's brand portfolio. In contrast, the 2024 filing references the Optum trademark within a broader context of trademarks owned, without explicitly reiterating the 'owns' language, suggesting a shift toward a more general acknowledgment of brand ownership. This change implies a reduced emphasis on the legal framing of Optum's trademark, possibly reflecting a strategic pivot where the brand is now more integrated into the company's broader identity rather than being highlighted as a distinct legal asset. The 2024 filing also places greater emphasis on human capital and corporate values, indicating a broader strategic shift that may align with a more holistic brand narrative.",

        "In 2022, the filing explicitly states that UnitedHealth Group 'owns' the Optum trademark, signaling a clear legal claim to the brand.",

Additionally, organizations like the NAIC periodically issue model regulations while credentialing organizations, like the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) and the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission (URAC), may establish standards impacting PBM pharmacy activities. Although these model regulations and standards do not have the force of law, they may influence states to adopt their recommendations and impact the services we deliver to our clients.\n\n## Consumer Protection Laws\n\nCertain of our businesses participate in direct-to-consumer activities and are subject to regulations applicable to online communications and other general consumer protection laws and regulations such as the Federal Tort Claims Act, the Federal Postal Service Act and the FTC's Telemarketing Sales Rule. Most states also have similar consumer protection laws.\n\nCertain laws, such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, give the FTC, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and state attorneys general the ability to regulate, and bring enforcement actions relating to, telemarketing practices and certain automated outbound contacts such as phone calls, texts or emails. Under certain circumstances, these laws may provide consumers with a private right of action. Violations of these laws could result in substantial statutory penalties and other sanctions.\n\n## Banking Regulation\n\nOptum Bank is subject to regulation by federal banking regulators, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which performs annual examinations to ensure the bank is operating in accordance with federal safety and soundness requirements, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which may perform periodic examinations to ensure the bank is in compliance with applicable consumer protection statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. Optum Bank is also subject to supervision and regulation by the Utah State Department of Financial Institutions, which carries out annual examinations to ensure the bank is operating in accordance with state safety and soundness requirements and performs periodic examinations of the bank's compliance with applicable state banking statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. In the event of unfavorable examination results from any of these agencies, the bank could become subject to increased operational expenses and capital requirements, enhanced governmental oversight and monetary penalties.\n\n## Non-U.S. Regulation\n\nCertain of our businesses operate internationally and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or conduct business. These regulatory regimes vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In addition, our non-U.S. businesses and operations are subject to U.S. laws regulating the conduct and activities of U.S.-based businesses operating abroad, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits offering, promising, providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage.\n\n## COMPETITION\n\nAs a diversified health care company, we operate in highly competitive markets across the full expanse of health care benefits and services, including organizations ranging from startups to highly sophisticated Fortune 50 global enterprises, for-profit and nonprofit companies, and private and government-sponsored entities.

Our approach is data-driven and leader-led and uses enterprise and business scorecards to ensure our leaders are accountable for a consistent focus on hiring, developing, advancing and retaining diverse talent.

We strive to maintain a skilled, sustainable and diverse talent pipeline by building strong strategic partnerships and outreach through early career programs, internships and apprenticeships. We support career coaching, mentorship and accelerated leadership development programs to ensure mobility and advancement for our diverse talent. To foster an engaged workforce and an inclusive culture, we invest in a broad array of skills-based learning and culture development programs. We rely on a shared leadership framework, which clearly and objectively defines our expectations, enables an environment where everyone has the opportunity to learn and grow, and helps us identify, develop and deploy talent to help achieve our mission.\n\nWe prioritize pay equity by objectively and regularly evaluating and reviewing our compensation practices by performance, age, experience, gender, ethnicity and race. Receiving on-going feedback from our team members is another way to strengthen and reinforce a culture of inclusion.

      "answer": "In 2023, Abbott had interest rate hedge contracts totaling approximately $2.2 billion at December 31, 2023, to manage exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to long-term benchmark interest rate fluctuations. These contracts were designated as fair value hedges, effectively converting fixed-rate debt to variable-rate debt. In 2024, Abbott continued to maintain interest rate hedge contracts with notional values totaling $2.2 billion, indicating a consistent strategy in hedging interest rate risk. However, the average interest rate on long-term debt increased from 3.6% in 2023 to 3.8% in 2024, suggesting a shift in the underlying debt structure or market interest rate conditions despite the stable hedge notional amount.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, Abbott used $2.2 billion in interest rate hedge contracts to convert fixed-rate debt exposure to variable rate, as stated in the financial instruments section.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the notional amount of interest rate hedge contracts remained unchanged at $2.2 billion, but the average interest rate on long-term debt rose from 3.6% to 3.8%.",
        "Step 3: The consistent notional amount of hedges indicates a stable hedging strategy, but the increase in average interest rate suggests a change in the debt profile or market conditions, reflecting an evolution in the context of the hedge's effectiveness."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\n## Financial Instruments and Risk Management\n\n## Market Price Sensitive Investments\n\nThe fair value of equity securities held by Abbott with a readily determinable fair value was approximately $10 million and $12 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These equity securities are subject to potential changes in fair value. A hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease their fair value at December 31, 2024 by approximately $2 million. Changes in the fair value of these securities are recorded in earnings. The fair value of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan was approximately $313 million and $314 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Changes in the fair value of these investments, as well as an offsetting change in the benefit obligation, are recorded in earnings.\n\n## Non-Publicly Traded E quity Securities\n\nAbbott holds equity securities that are not traded on public stock exchanges. The carrying value of these investments was $91 million and $88 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. No individual investment is recorded at a value in excess of $20 million. Abbott measures these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.\n\n## Interest Rate Sensitive Financial Instruments\n\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, Abbott had interest rate hedge contracts with notional values totaling $2.2 billion to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of debt. The effect of these hedges is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate for the portion of the debt that is hedged. Abbott does not use derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for its investment securities. The fair value of longterm debt at December 31, 2024 and 2023 amounted to $13.7 billion and $14.8 billion, respectively (average interest rates of 3.8% and 3.6% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023,  respectively)  with  maturities  through  2046.  At  December  31,  2024  and  2023,  the  fair  value  of  current  and  long-term  investment  securities  amounted  to approximately $1.2 billion. A hypothetical 100-basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material effect on cash flows, income or fair values.\n\n## Foreign Currency Sensitive Financial Instruments\n\nCertain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the  variability  of  the  cash  flows  due  to  changes  in  foreign  currency  ex change  rates  and  are  marked-to-market  with  the  resulting  gains  or  losses  reflected  in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). G ains or losses will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally within the next twelve to eighteen months. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Abbott held $7.0 billion and $7.3 billion of notional values, respectively, of such contracts. Contracts held at December 31, 2024 will mature in 2025 or 2026 depending on the contract. Contracts held at December 31, 2023 matured in 2024 or will mature in 2025 depending upon the contract.\n\nAbbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated intercompany loans and trade payables and third-party trade payables and receivables. The contracts are marked-to-market, and resulting gains or losses are reflected in income and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Abbott held $16.2 billion and $13.8 billion of notional values, respectively, of such contracts, which mature within 13 months.\n\nAbbott has designated a yen-denominated, 5-year term loan of approximately $583 million and $419 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The change in the value of the debt is due to net incremental borrowing of $201 million, discussed in Note 10 - Debt and Lines of Credit, as well as changes in foreign exchange rates, recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.\n\n.",

By 2024, the Quadra Assura MP continued to be featured in the rhythm management section but was now mentioned alongside newer technologies like the Aveir single-chamber and dual-chamber leadless pacemaker systems. This evolution suggests that Abbott has maintained the Quadra Assura MP as a core product while expanding its portfolio with complementary innovations, positioning it within a broader ecosystem of advanced rhythm management solutions.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Vraylar was described as being evaluated in Phase 3 clinical trials as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), with one trial meeting its primary endpoint and the other showing numerical but not statistically significant improvement. By 2024, Vraylar was disclosed as being indicated for a broader range of psychiatric conditions, including acute and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia, acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorder, acute treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, and as an adjunctive treatment in major depressive disorder. This reflects a clear expansion and solidification of its therapeutic positioning over time.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, Vraylar was in Phase 3 trials for MDD with mixed results\u2014Study 3111-301-001 met the primary endpoint while Study 3111-302-001 did not achieve statistical significance.",
        "Step 2: By 2024, Vraylar was disclosed as having full indications for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder (manic/mixed and depressive episodes), and as an adjunctive treatment in MDD, indicating regulatory approvals and broader clinical adoption.",
        "Step 3: The change represents a transformation in Vraylar's therapeutic positioning\u2014from an investigational adjunctive treatment in MDD with partial success to a fully indicated, multi-therapeutic psychiatric medication."

The total fair value of options vested during 2024 was $18 million. As of December 31, 2024, $6 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be recognized as expense over approximately the next two years.\n\n## RSUs and Performance Shares\n\nRSUs awarded to employees other than senior executives and other key employees generally vest in ratable increments over a three-year period. Recipients of these RSUs are entitled to receive dividend equivalents as dividends are declared and paid during the RSU vesting period.\n\nThe majority of the equity awards AbbVie grants to its senior executives and other key employees are performance-based. Equity awards granted to senior executives and other key employees consist of a combination of performance-vested RSUs and performance shares as well as non-qualified stock options described above. The performance-vested RSUs have the potential to vest in one-third increments during a three-year performance period and may be earned based on AbbVie's return on invested capital (ROIC) performance relative to a defined peer group of pharmaceutical, biotech and life science\n\n## 89 | 2024 Form 10-K",

      "question": "How has the structure of AbbVie's Non-Employee Director RSU Agreements evolved between 2022 and 2024, based on the versions incorporated into their annual reports?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AbbVie referenced the Non-Employee Director RSU Agreement from March 31, 2021, as part of Exhibit 10.3. By 2024, the company incorporated an updated version of the agreement dated March 31, 2024, listed as Exhibit 10.38. This indicates that AbbVie revised the RSU agreement at least once during this period, with the 2024 version reflecting the most current terms. The repeated updates suggest an ongoing refinement of director equity compensation terms, possibly to align with evolving governance standards or internal compensation strategies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, the most recent incorporated RSU Agreement was dated March 31, 2021, as shown in Exhibit 10.3.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, a new version dated March 31, 2024, was incorporated as Exhibit 10.38, replacing the earlier version.",
        "Step 3: The update from the 2021 version to the 2024 version reflects a structural evolution in the agreement terms, indicating changes in how non-employee directors are compensated through RSUs."

      "question": "How has UnitedHealth Group's exposure to financial risk through risk-based arrangements with healthcare providers evolved from 2023 to 2024, and what implications does this have on its cost estimation and service delivery responsibilities?",
      "answer": "In 2023, UnitedHealth Group assumed economic risk under risk-based arrangements where it was responsible for funding healthcare costs, and it recognized premium revenues based on estimated premiums earned, net of projected rebates. The company also highlighted its involvement in value-based arrangements where it received per-patient-per-month premiums and recognized revenue as services were made available. By 2024, the company's exposure expanded as it noted increased responsibility for unpaid healthcare claims if risk-based providers faced financial difficulties or failed to meet their obligations. Additionally, the 2024 disclosures emphasized greater operational risk tied to providers' ability to manage costs, maintain solvency, and provide necessary data for cost estimation, indicating a broader and more complex financial exposure compared to 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, UnitedHealth Group recognized premium revenues under risk-based and value-based arrangements, assuming economic risk for healthcare costs and estimating revenues net of rebates.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the company's risk increased as it could be held responsible for unpaid claims if contracted providers failed to perform, and it faced additional challenges from providers' cost management, solvency, and data transparency.",
        "Step 3: The evolution from assuming economic risk for costs (2023) to bearing responsibility for provider failures and data gaps (2024) indicates a transformation in the nature and magnitude of financial exposure under risk-based arrangements."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nincidents or implement adequate preventive measures. Threat actors and hackers have previously been, and may in the future be, able to negatively affect our operations by penetrating our security controls and causing system and operational disruptions or shutdowns, accessing, misappropriating or otherwise compromising protected personal information or proprietary or confidential information or that of third parties, and developing and deploying viruses, ransomware and other malware that can attack our systems, exploit any security vulnerabilities, and disrupt or shutdown our systems and operations. In addition, hardware, software, or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects or other problems which could unexpectedly compromise our information security controls. Our systems may also be vulnerable to financial fraud schemes, misplaced or lost data, error, malicious social engineering, or other events which could negatively affect the data or financial accounts, proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third parties, or our operations. There have previously been and may be in the future heightened vulnerabilities due to recently-acquired or non-integrated businesses. We rely in some circumstances on thirdparty vendors to process, store and transmit large amounts of data for our business. The operations of these vendors are subject to similar risks, but are outside our direct oversight and control.\n\nThe costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cybersecurity incident could be material. We have business continuation and resiliency plans which we maintain, update and test regularly in an effort to contain and remediate potential disruptions or cybersecurity events. If our remediation efforts are not successful, we may experience operational interruptions, delays, or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. In addition, compromises of our security measures or the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information, proprietary information or confidential information about us, our customers or other third parties, previously and in the future, could expose us or them to the risk of financial or medical identity theft, negative operational impacts, and loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and liability, including regulatory penalties, for us, damage our brand and reputation, or otherwise harm our business.\n\n## If we fail to dev elop and maintain satisfactory relationships w ith health care payers, physicians, hospitals and other serv ice prov iders, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nWe depend substantially on our continued ability to contract with health care payers (as a service provider to those payers), as well as physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and other care and service providers at competitive prices. If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers, whether in-network or out-of-network, our failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, some of our activities related to network design, provider participation in networks and provider payments could result in disputes, which may be costly and attract negative publicity.\n\nIn any particular market, physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract with us, demand higher payments, or take other actions which could result in higher medical costs, less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, certain health care providers, particularly hospitals, physician and hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions which could diminish our bargaining power. In addition, Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs); physician group management services organizations (which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency); and other organizational structures adopted by physicians, hospitals and other care providers may change the way in which these providers do business with us and may change the competitive landscape. Such organizations or groups of physicians may compete directly with us, which could adversely affect our business, and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way we price our products and estimate our costs, which might require us to incur costs to change our operations in an effort to mitigate these impacts. In addition, if these providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nOur health care benefits businesses have risk-based arrangements with some physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. These arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but ex pose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the health care providers. To the extent a risk-based health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the arrangement, we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims which should have been the responsibility of the health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider. Further, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts could result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. Health care providers with which we contract may not properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. They may also fail to provide us with the information we need to effectively conduct our businesses, such as information enabling us to estimate costs of care. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations.\n\nSome providers that render services to our members do not have contracts with us. In some instances, those providers may dispute the payment for these services and may institute litigation or arbitration relying on state and federal laws that define the compensation that must be paid to out-of-network providers in some circumstances.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Optum Rx managed $159 billion in pharmaceutical spending, including $63 billion in specialty pharmaceutical spending, and operated through a network of over 65,000 retail pharmacies, home delivery, and specialty pharmacies. By 2024, Optum Rx's revenue recognition methodology was more explicitly detailed, noting that product revenues are reported on a gross basis due to the company's obligation to pay network pharmacy providers regardless of customer payment. Additionally, accounts receivables related to products and services increased from $8.6 billion in 2023 to $9.9 billion in 2024, indicating a growth in financial exposure and potentially expanded operations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 - In 2023, Optum Rx managed $159 billion in pharmaceutical spending, including $63 billion in specialty pharmaceuticals, and operated through a broad pharmacy network.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 - In 2024, Optum Rx's revenue recognition methodology was detailed, showing product revenues reported on a gross basis, and accounts receivables increased to $9.9 billion.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The financial structure evolved with a more transparent revenue recognition policy and increased accounts receivables, indicating operational growth and financial exposure."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Products and Services\n\nFor the Company's Optum Rx pharmacy care services business, the majority of revenues are derived from products sold through a contracted network of retail pharmacies or home delivery, specialty and community health pharmacies. Product revenues include the cost of pharmaceuticals (net of rebates), a negotiated dispensing fee and customer co-payments. Pharmacy products are billed to customers based on the number of transactions occurring during the billing period. Product revenues are recognized when the prescriptions are dispensed. The Company has entered into contracts in which it is primarily obligated to pay its network pharmacy providers for benefits provided to their customers regardless of whether the Company is paid. The Company is also involved in establishing the prices charged by retail pharmacies, determining which drugs will be included in formulary listings and selecting which retail pharmacies will be included in the network offered to plan sponsors' members and accordingly, product revenues are reported on a gross basis.\n\nServices revenue includes a number of services and products sold through Optum. Optum Health's service revenues include net patient service revenues recorded based upon established billing rates, less allowances for contractual adjustments, and are recognized as services are provided. For its financial services offerings, Optum Health charges fees and earns investment income on managed funds. Optum Insight provides software and information products, advisory consulting arrangements and managed services outsourcing contracts, which may be delivered over several years. Optum Insight revenues are generally recognized over time and measured for each period based on the progress to date as services are performed or made available to customers.\n\nServices revenue also consists of fees derived from services performed for customers who self-insure the health care costs of their employees and employees' dependents. Under service fee contracts, the Company receives a monthly fixed fee per employee, which is recognized as revenue as the Company performs, or makes available, the applicable services to the customer. The customers retain the risk of financing health care costs for their employees and employees' dependents, and the Company administers the payment of customer funds to physicians and other health care professionals from customer-funded bank accounts. As the Company has neither the obligation for funding the health care costs, nor the primary responsibility for providing the medical care, the Company does not recognize premium revenue and medical costs for these contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For these fee-based customer arrangements, the Company provides coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; customer, consumer and care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. These services are performed throughout the contract period.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, accounts receivables related to products and services were $9.9 billion and $8.6 billion, respectively. In 2024 and 2023, the Company had no material bad-debt expense and there were no material contract assets, contract liabilities or deferred contract costs recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 or 2023.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, revenue recognized from performance obligations related to prior periods (for example, due to changes in transaction price) was not material.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, revenue expected to be recognized in any future year related to remaining performance obligations, excluding revenue pertaining to contracts having an original expected duration of one year or less, contracts where revenue is recognized as invoiced and contracts with variable consideration related to undelivered performance obligations, was $12.7 billion, of which approximately half is ex pected to be recognized in the nex t three years.\n\nSee Note 14 for disaggregation of revenue by segment and type.\n\n## Medical Costs and Medical Costs Payable\n\nThe Company's estimate of medical costs payable represents management's best estimate of its liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2024.\n\nEach period, the Company re-examines previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, the Company adjusts the amount of the estimates and includes the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. Approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months.\n\nMedical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of the Company's obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received, processed, or paid. The Company develops estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported (IBNR), which includes estimates for claims which have not been received or fully processed, using an actuarial process consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim processing, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, care activity and other medical cost trends, membership volume and",

      "answer": "In 2023, UnitedHealth Group disclosed multiple versions of award agreements under the 2020 Stock Incentive Plan, including both current (2024 Version) and prior (2023 Version) forms for Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), Nonqualified Stock Options (NSOs), and Performance-Based RSUs for executives like Witty and Bondy. These forms were either directly included or incorporated by reference, indicating a layered documentation approach for different executive roles and timeframes. By 2024, the company reported 48 million shares available under the 2020 Stock Incentive Plan for future awards, which may include stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs, performance awards, and other stock-based awards. This indicates a shift toward broader flexibility in award structures and a more centralized administration of the plan. The evolution suggests a strategic move from maintaining multiple versions of agreements to emphasizing scalability and future-oriented award design under a unified plan framework.",

      "answer": "In 2023, UnitedHealth Group emphasized accelerating the transition to value-based care delivery models, investing in clinical engagement, integrated care coordination technology, and new delivery channels like in-home and virtual care. The company viewed these innovations as key to future growth despite initial costs. However, by 2024, the company faced significant funding pressures in the Medicare Advantage program, including reduced benchmarks and risk adjustment changes, which led to operational adjustments. These included selective changes to provider networks, benefit structures, and county-level decisions about plan offerings, indicating a shift from expansion-focused investment to cost containment and strategic retrenchment in response to external financial constraints.",

Some of our Optum businesses also provide services to payers participating in government health care programs. A reduction or less than expected increase, or a protracted delay, in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies, or termination of the contract at the option of the government, has affected and in future periods may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nThe government health care programs in which we participate are generally subject to frequent changes, including changes which may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage (such as Medicaid eligibility redeterminations in certain states), reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, reduce our participation in, or prevent our ex pansion into, certain service areas or markets, or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs. Revenues for these programs depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms. Funding for these government programs depends on many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level. For ex ample, CMS in the past has reduced or frozen Medicare Advantage benchmarks and additional cuts to Medicare Advantage benchmarks are possible. In addition, from time to time, CMS makes changes to the way it calculates Medicare Advantage risk adjustment payments. Although we have adjusted members' benefits and premiums on a selective basis, ceased to offer benefit plans in certain counties, and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to the benchmark reductions and other funding pressures, these or other strategies may not fully address the funding pressures in the Medicare Advantage program. In addition, payers in the Medicare Advantage program may be subject to reductions in payments from CMS as a result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit. States have also made changes in rates and reimbursements for Medicaid members and audits can result in unexpected recoupments.\n\nUnder the Medicaid managed care program, state Medicaid agencies solicit bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care Medicaid health programs. If we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state Medicaid managed care contracts, we risk losing the members who were enrolled in those Medicaid programs. Under the Medicare Part D program, to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members, our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark, which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted. If the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark, we risk losing the members who were auto-assigned to us and will not have additional members auto-assigned to us. Chronic failure to meet the benchmarks could result in termination of these government contracts. In general, our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, medical costs and other factors. If any of these assumptions are materially incorrect, either as a result of unforeseen changes to the programs on which we bid, implementation of material program or policy changes after our bid submission, or submissions by our competitors at lower rates than our bids, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nMany of the government health care coverage programs we participate in are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance standards or benchmarks. For example, as part of the ACA, CMS has a system providing various quality bonus payments to Medicare Advantage plans meeting specified quality star ratings at the individual plan or local contract level. The star rating system considers various measures adopted by CMS, including, among others, quality of care, preventive services, chronic illness management, handling of appeals and customer satisfaction. Plans must have a rating of four stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments, and CMS has and may make changes to the star rating program that impact the ability of plans to achieve four-star or higher ratings. If we do not maintain or continue to improve our star ratings, our plans may not be eligible for quality bonuses and we may experience a negative impact on our revenues and the benefits our plans can offer, which could materially and adversely affect the marketability of our plans and the number of people we serve. Any changes in standards or care delivery models applying to government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or our inability to maintain or improve our quality scores and star ratings to meet evolving government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or ex clusion from these or other government programs, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nCMS uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding and adjust monthly capitation payments for Medicare programs. For Medicare Advantage plans, these adjustments are made according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers. For Medicare Part D plans, payment adjustments are driven by risk-sharing provisions based on a comparison of costs forecasted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs. Some state Medicaid programs utilize a similar process.

By 2024, this sensitivity had decreased to \u00b13.1%, indicating a reduced responsiveness of cost projections to variations in benefit design.

Medical cost PMPM trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design and a review of a broad set of health care utilization indicators. These factors include but are not limited to pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital authorization data and seasonal and other incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth, employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates, including: our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized; mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles; changes in medical practices; and catastrophes, epidemics and pandemics.\n\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months as of December 31, 2024:\n\n",

In 2023, the 1.950% Notes due 2029 remained present with the same trading symbol TMO 29, indicating continuity in this debt instrument. However, TMO introduced new debt instruments in 2023, such as the 3.200% Notes due 2026 and the 3.650% Notes due 2034, suggesting a broader shift in financing strategy.

By 2023, TMO continued to list the 0.500% Notes due 2028, but introduced new debt categories such as the 3.200% Notes due 2026 and the 3.650% Notes due 2034, while maintaining similar categories like the 1.375% Notes due 2028.

During 2025, the Company's cash contribution requirements for its U.S. and its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are forecasted to be approximately $8 million and $35 million, respectiv ely. The ultimate amounts to be contributed depend upon, among other things, legal requirements, underlying asset returns, the plan's funded status, the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution, local practices, market conditions, interest rates and other factors.\n\n## Contractual and Other Obligations\n\nFor a description of the Company's debt and lease obligations, commitments, and litigation and contingencies, refer to Notes 9, 13, 16 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Legal Proceedings\n\nRefer to Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding legal proceedings and contingencies, and for a discussion of risks related to legal proceedings and contingencies, refer to 'Item 1A. Risk Factors.'\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nManagement's discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, which hav e been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, rev enues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. T he Company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience, the current economic env ironment and on v arious other assumptions that are believ ed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates and judgments.\n\nThe Company believes the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements. Estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and (2) material changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from period-to-period. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nAcquired Intangibles-The Company's business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill, dev eloped technology and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that the Company may incur. The fair v alues of acquired intangibles are determined using information av ailable near the acquisition date based on estimates and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by the Company. Significant assumptions include the discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results of the acquired business including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ('EBITDA'), rev enue, rev enue growth rates, royalty rates and technology obsolescence rates. These assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. The Company engages third-party v aluation specialists who rev iew the Company's critical assumptions and calculations of the fair v alue of acquired intangible assets in connection with significant acquisitions. In connection with the acquisitions that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized aggregate goodwill of $305 million and intangible assets of $419 million. Refer to Notes 1, 2 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company's policies relating to goodwill, acquired intangibles and acquisitions.\n\nIn performing its goodwill impairment testing, the Company estimates the fair v alue of its reporting units primarily using a market-based approach which relies on current trading multiples of forecasted EBITDA for companies operating in businesses similar to each of the Company's reporting units to calculate an estimated fair v alue of each reporting unit. In ev aluating the estimates deriv ed by the market-based approach, management makes judgments about the relev ance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and marketplace data as well as judgments about the comparability of the market proxies selected. There are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management's judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had fiv e reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. Reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally present the highest risk of impairment. Management believ es the impairment risk associated with these reporting units generally decreases as these businesses are integrated into the Company and better positioned for potential future earnings growth. The Company's annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2024 indicated that in all instances, the fair v alues of the Company's reporting units exceeded their carrying v alues and consequently did not result in an impairment charge. The excess of the estimated fair v alue ov er carrying v alue (expressed as a percentage of carrying v alue for the respectiv e reporting unit) for each of the Company's reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 70% to approximately 450%.

      "answer": "The 1.350% Senior Notes due 2039 were listed on the New York Stock Exchange in both the 2023 and 2024 filings, indicating that the instrument remained active and unchanged in terms of listing status. However, in the 2023 filing, it was introduced as part of the company's capital structure, while in the 2024 filing, it continued to be listed alongside other senior notes, suggesting that DHR maintained this long-term debt instrument as a consistent component of its financing strategy.

      "answer": "In 2023, Danaher explicitly defined 'Other Developed Markets' as Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, distinguishing them from both North America and high-growth markets. In 2024, the company continued to use this same classification, reporting that 4% of Diagnostics segment sales came from 'Other Developed Markets'. The fact that the geographic segmentation remained unchanged and was specifically referenced in the Diagnostics segment\u2019s sales breakdown indicates that Danaher continues to view these markets as strategically distinct. This consistency in classification and reporting suggests a deliberate approach to market segmentation for performance tracking and strategic planning, rather than treating these markets as part of a broader developed or general international category.",

        "The continued use of this distinct classification across both years indicates a stable strategic and operational view of these markets, suggesting they are monitored separately for business performance and planning purposes."

      "question": "How did MDT's exposure to auction rate securities evolve from 2022 to 2023 in terms of fair value and classification within the balance sheet?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MDT reported auction rate securities with a fair value of $33 million and classified them under 'Total' in the investment portfolio without specifying a separate balance sheet classification. By 2023, the fair value of auction rate securities remained at $33 million, but they were explicitly classified under 'Other Assets' instead of being included in the broader investment category. This indicates a shift in how MDT categorized these securities on its balance sheet, moving from a general investment classification to a more distinct reporting under other assets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify the state of auction rate securities in 2022 \u2014 MDT disclosed a fair value of $33 million within the total investment portfolio without a distinct balance sheet classification.",
        "Step 2: Identify the state of auction rate securities in 2023 \u2014 MDT continued to report a fair value of $33 million but explicitly classified them under 'Other Assets' in the balance sheet.",
        "Step 3: Analyze the change \u2014 While the fair value remained stable, the reclassification from a general investment category to a specific 'Other Assets' classification indicates an evolution in MDT's financial reporting approach for auction rate securities."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\ndistribution and sale of the system. The net sales for the Medtronic HVAD system for fiscal year 2021 was $141 million.\n\nStructural Heart &amp; Aortic (SHA) net sales increased 8 percent in fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021. The increase was led by growth in transcatheter  aortic  valve  replacement  (TAVR)  net  sales  as  a  result  of  continued  adoption  of  the  CoreValve  Evolut.  Cardiac Surgery also contributed to the net increase in sales as a result of broad growth across the business, particularly from strong sales of ExtraCorporeal Life Support (ECLS) devices. These increases were partially offset by declines within Aortic caused by field corrective actions (FCA) and COVID-19 challenges. The most notable field corrective actions were for the Valiant Navion Thoracic Stent Graft System FCA issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 and the Endurant II/IIs Stent Graft Systems FCA issued in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022.\n\nCoronary &amp; Peripheral Vascular (CPV) net sales increased 5 percent in fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021. The increase was led  by  growth  in  Peripheral  Vascular  Health  driven  by  strong  performance  of  the  recently  launched Abre  venous  self-expanding  stent system for Deep Venous disease, as well as our superficial venous product portfolio, including the VenaSeal and ClosureFast systems. The increase  was  partially  offset  by  declines  in  Coronary  as  well  as  Atherectomy  products  due  to  impacts  of  COVID-19  on  procedural volumes.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  macro-economic  and  geopolitical  factors  described  in  the  Executive  Level  Overview,  looking  ahead,  we  expect Cardiovascular could be affected by the following:\n\n- Continued growth of our Micra transcatheter pacing system. The Micra AV launched in Japan in November 2021 and received approval  in  China  in  May  2022.  Micra AV  expands  the  Micra  target  population  from  15  percent  to  45  percent  of  pacemaker patients.\n- Continued acceptance and growth from the Azure XT and S SureScan pacing systems. Azure pacemakers feature Medtronicexclusive BlueSync technology, which enables automatic, secure wireless remote monitoring with increased device longevity.\n- Growth of the Cobalt and Crome portfolio of ICDs and CRT-Ds.\n- Continued  acceptance  and  expansion  of  the  Claria  MRI  CRT-D  system  with  AdaptivCRT  and  compatibility  with  TriageHF technology.\n- Continued acceptance and expansion of the LINQ II cardiac monitor. Supply for the LINQ II cardiac monitor is improving as we continue to ramp our wafer scale manufacturing. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, we launched two AccuRhythm AI algorithms on the LINQ II platform to significantly reduce false positive alerts for Atrial Fibrillation and Pause while retaining sensitivity for true positive detection, and reduce clinic workload and burden.\n- Growth of the CRT-P quadripolar pacing system.\n- Continued growth, adoption, and utilization of the TYRX Envelope for implantable devices.\n- Continued acceptance and market expansion of Arctic Front cryoablation for treatment of atrial fibrillation. In June 2021, the Arctic Front cryoablation system received a first line therapy designation from the U.S. FDA for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.\n- Continued acceptance and growth of the self-expanding CoreValve Evolut transcatheter aortic valve replacement platform into intermediate risk indication globally and for the treatment of patients determined to be at low risk with surgery.\n- Continued expansion and training of field support to increase coverage in the U.S. centers performing TAVR procedures.\n- Continued acceptance and growth from Evolut PRO, which provides industry-leading hemodynamics, reliable delivery, enhanced durability versus SAVR procedures at 5 years, and advanced sealing with an excellent safety profile. In August 2021, the U.S. FDA approved  the  Evolut  FX  TAVR,  a  system  enhancement  designed  to  improve  the  overall  procedural  experience  through enhancements in deliverability, implant visibility and deployment stability. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, Evolut PRO received NMPA approval within China.\n- Continued acceptance and growth from the VenaSeal Closure System in the U.S. The VenaSeal Closure System is a unique nonthermal solution to address superficial venous disease that provides improved patient comfort, reduces the recovery time, and eliminates the risk of thermal nerve injury.\n- Continued acceptance and growth of the Abre venous self-expanding stent system in the U.S. as well as pressure from competitors re-entering the market. Abre is designed for the unique challenges of venous disease. It offers easy deployment, to let physicians focus on their patient, and delivers demonstrated endurance, to give patients freedom of movement.\n- Our  voluntary  recall  of  the  Valiant  Navion  Thoracic  Stent  Graft  System  and  our  ability  to  ramp  production  of  our  previous generation product, the Valiant Captivia Thoracic Stent Graft System. We are currently ramping production of the Valiant Captivia Thoracic Stent Graft System and plan to reach full production capacity in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the disclosures related to the 2008 Stock Award and Incentive Plan included forms of Non-Employee Director Initial Option Agreement (Exhibit 10.39). By 2023, the company introduced additional forms of agreements, including the Non-Employee Director Annual Option Agreement and the Non-Employee Director Deferred Unit Award Agreement (Exhibits 10.40 and 10.41). This indicates an expansion and refinement of the award structures available to non-employee directors, suggesting a more comprehensive and flexible approach to director compensation through the incentive plan.",

      "answer": "In the 2022 disclosure, the 2051 U.S. Notes were introduced with an aggregate principal amount of $1,000 million, a stated annual interest rate of 2.8%, and were issued on December 10, 2021, at 99.396% of par value. By the 2024 disclosure, these notes had an outstanding amount of $985 million as of 2024 and $984 million as of 2023. This indicates that while the notes remain outstanding, their carrying value has slightly declined from the original issuance amount, potentially due to amortization or market adjustments.",

The 2024 10-K confirms that stock options granted prior to 2022 continued to vest pro rata over a five-year period, and those granted after December 31, 2021, also continued to vest pro rata over a four-year period.

The 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan provides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, restricted stock, PSUs or any other stock-based award and cash-based awards. A total of approximately 127 million shares of Danaher common stock have been authorized for issuance under the 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 50 million shares of the Company's common stock remain available for issuance under the 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan.\n\nStock options granted prior to 2022 under the 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan generally vest pro rata over a five-year period and terminate ten years from the grant date, though the specific terms of each grant are determined by the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board (the 'Compensation Committee'). Stock options granted subsequent to December 31, 2021 under the amended and restated 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan generally vest pro rata over a four-year period and terminate ten years from the grant date, though specific terms of each grant are determined by the Compensation Committee. The Company's executive officers and certain other employees have been awarded options with different vesting criteria, and options granted to outside directors are fully vested as of the grant date. Option exercise prices for options granted by the Company equal the closing price of the Company's common stock on the NYSE on the date of grant.\n\nRSUs issued under the 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan provide for the issuance of a share of the Company's common stock at no cost to the holder. RSUs granted prior to 2022 to employees under the 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan generally provide for time-based vesting over a five-year period, although executive officers and certain other employees have been awarded RSUs with different vesting criteria. RSUs granted subsequent to December 31, 2021 to employees under the amended and restated 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan generally vest pro rata over a four-year period, although executive officers and certain other employees have been awarded RSUs with different vesting criteria. The RSUs that have been granted to directors under the 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan vest on the earlier of the first anniversary of the grant date or the date of, and immediately prior to, the next annual meeting of the Company's shareholders following the grant date, but the underlying shares are not issued until the earlier of the director's death or the first day of the seventh month following the director's retirement from the Board. Prior to vesting, RSUs granted under the 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan do not have dividend equivalent rights, do not have voting rights and the shares underlying the RSUs are not considered issued and outstanding.\n\nPSUs issued under the 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan provide for the issuance of a share of the Company's common stock at no cost to the holder, vest based on specified performance criteria, are subject to an additional holding period following vesting and are entitled to dividend equivalent rights. The PSU dividend equivalent rights are subject to the same vesting and payment restrictions as the related shares, and the shares underlying the PSUs are not considered issued and outstanding.\n\nIn connection with the Envista Disposition, Envista adopted a stock-based compensation plan, which provided for stock-based awards denominated in shares of Envista common stock. Envista employees who participated in the Danaher stock compensation program prior to the Separation continued to participate in such program solely with respect to outstanding compensation awards received prior to the Separation, until the Split-Off (at which time such awards were terminated and replaced with awards denominated in Envista common stock under the Envista stock compensation plan). Stock-based compensation expense for Envista is included in results from discontinued operations.\n\nThe equity compensation awards granted by the Company generally vest only if the employee is employed by the Company (or in the case of directors, the director continues to serve on the Company Board) on the vesting date or in other limited circumstances, including following a qualifying retirement.

The Company also reviews the methodologies and the assumptions used to calculate prices from these observable inputs. On a quarterly basis, the Company selects a sample of its Level 2 debt securities' prices and compares them to prices provided by a secondary source. Variances over a specified threshold are identified and reviewed to confirm the price provided by the primary source represents an appropriate estimate of fair value. In addition, the Company's internal investment team consistently compares the prices obtained for select Level 2 debt securities to the team's own independent estimates of fair value for those securities. The Company obtained one price for each of its Level 2 debt securities and did not adjust any of those prices at December 31, 2021 or 2020.\n\nThe Company also values certain debt securities using Level 3 inputs. For Level 3 debt securities, fair values are determined by outside brokers or, in the case of certain private placement securities, are priced internally. Outside brokers determine the value of these debt securities through a combination of their knowledge of the current pricing environment and market flows. The Company did not have any broker quoted debt securities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. For some private placement securities, the Company's internal staff determines the value of these debt securities by analyzing spreads of corporate and sector indices as well as interest spreads of comparable public bonds. Examples of these private placement Level 3 debt securities include certain U.S. and foreign securities and certain tax-exempt municipal securities.\n\nEquity Securities -The Company currently has two classifications of equity securities: those that are publicly traded and those that are privately placed. Publicly-traded equity securities are classified in Level 1 because quoted prices are available for these securities in an active market. For privately placed equity securities, there is no active market; therefore, these securities are classified in Level 3 because the Company prices these securities through an internal analysis of each investment's financial statements and cash flow projections. Significant unobservable inputs consist of earnings and revenue multiples, discount for lack of marketability and comparability adjustments. An increase or decrease in any of these unobservable inputs would have resulted in a change in the fair value measurement.",

See Note 1 ''Significant Accounting Policies'' for additional information regarding the valuation of cost method investments.\n\n## Separate Accounts Measured at Fair Value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets\n\nSeparate Accounts assets relate to the Company's large case pensions products which represent funds maintained to meet specific objectives of contract holders. Since contract holders bear the investment risk of these assets, a corresponding Separate Accounts liability has been established equal to the assets. These assets and liabilities are carried at fair value. Net investment income and capital gains and losses on Separate Accounts assets accrue directly to such contract holders. The assets of each account are legally segregated and are not subject to claims arising from the Company's other businesses. Deposits, withdrawals, net investment income and realized and unrealized capital gains and losses on Separate Accounts assets are not reflected in the consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity or cash flows.\n\nSeparate Accounts assets include debt and equity securities. The valuation methodologies used for these assets are similar to the methodologies described above in this Note 4 ''Fair Value.'' Separate Accounts assets also include investments in common/collective trusts that are carried at fair value. Common/collective trusts invest in other investment funds otherwise known as the underlying funds. The Separate Accounts' interests in the common/collective trust funds are based on the fair values of the investments of the underlying funds and therefore are classified in Level 2. The assets in the underlying funds primarily consist of equity securities. Investments in common/collective trust funds are valued at their respective net asset value ('NAV') per share/unit on the valuation date.",

By 2024, the balance had decreased to $663 million, and the effective interest rate slightly declined to 2.07%. This indicates a reduction in the outstanding amount of this debt instrument over the two-year period, while the interest rate remained relatively stable.",

      "answer": "In 2022, TMO reported $1,200 million in 2.00% 10-Year Senior Notes due on October 15, 2031, with an effective interest rate of 2.23%. By 2024, the same category of 2.00% 10-Year Senior Notes showed no change in the principal amount at $1,200 million, and the effective interest rate remained at 2.23%. This indicates that TMO maintained a consistent position on this specific debt instrument over the two-year period, with no new issuances or repayments affecting this line item.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, the 2.00% 10-Year Senior Notes due 10/15/2031 were reported at $1,200 million with an effective interest rate of 2.23%.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the same 2.00% 10-Year Senior Notes remained at $1,200 million with the same effective interest rate of 2.23%.",
        "Step 3: The unchanged principal and interest rate indicate that TMO did not alter its issuance or valuation of this specific debt instrument between 2022 and 2024."

      "answer": "In 2022, REMICADE was listed as a key product in Johnson & Johnson's Pharmaceutical segment, specifically within the Immunology therapeutic area, indicating its importance in treating immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. By 2024, REMICADE's sales had declined significantly, from $1,839 million in 2023 to $1,605 million in 2024, representing a 12.8% decrease. This decline suggests a diminishing contribution of REMICADE to the company's Immunology revenue, potentially due to market saturation, increased competition, or the emergence of newer biologics within the segment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 (2022) - REMICADE was highlighted as a key product in the Pharmaceutical segment, specifically within Immunology, indicating its strategic importance.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 (2024) - REMICADE's sales dropped from $1,839 million in 2023 to $1,605 million in 2024, a 12.8% decrease.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The significant drop in REMICADE sales over this period indicates a reduced financial contribution to the Immunology therapeutic area, suggesting a shift in the product's role within the segment."

      "answer": "REMICADE's sales declined significantly from $16.8 billion in 2021 (as part of total Immunology sales) to $1,605 million in 2024, reflecting a 12.8% decrease from 2023 to 2024 alone. This decline was primarily driven by biosimilar competition in the U.S. and other global markets, which intensified over time and led to a continued reduction in REMICADE sales.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2021, REMICADE was part of Immunology products that achieved $16.8 billion in sales, with the decline attributed to biosimilar competition.",
        "Step 2: By 2024, REMICADE's sales had dropped to $1,605 million, showing a 12.8% total decline from 2023, further confirming the impact of biosimilars.",
        "Step 3: The consistent mention of biosimilar competition in both years indicates a sustained and worsening trend that directly impacted REMICADE\u2019s sales trajectory over time."

          "chunk_text": "Immunology products achieved sales of $16.8 billion in 2021, representing an increase of 11.3% as compared to the prior year driven by strong uptake of STELARA (ustekinumab) in Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis and strength in TREMFYA (guselkumab) in Psoriasis and uptake in Psoriatic Arthritis. This was partially offset by lower sales of REMICADE (infliximab) due to biosimilar competition. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\nBiosimilar versions of REMICADE have been introduced in the United States and certain markets outside the United States and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition will result in a further reduction in sales of REMICADE . \u00ae \u00ae\n\nThe latest expiring United States patent for STELARA (ustekinumab) will expire in September 2023. STELARA (ustekinumab) U.S. sales in fiscal 2021 were approximately $5.9 billion. The expiration of a product patent or loss of market exclusivity is likely to result in a reduction in sales. \u00ae \u00ae\n\nInfectious disease products achieved sales of $5.9 billion in 2021, representing an increase of 64.0% as compared to the prior year. Growth was primarily driven by the contribution of the COVID-19 vaccine. This was partially offset by lower sales of PREZISTA and PREZCOBIX /REZOLSTA  (darunavir/cobicistat) due to increased competition and loss of exclusivity of PREZISTA in certain countries outside the U.S. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\nNeuroscience products achieved sales of $7.0 billion, representing an increase of 7.1% as compared to the prior year. Paliperidone long-acting injectables growth was driven by sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA /XEPLION  (paliperidone palmitate) and INVEGA TRINZA /TREVICTA  from new patient starts and persistence as well as the launch of INVEGA HAFYERA\u2122. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\nOncology products achieved sales of $14.5 billion in 2021, representing an increase of 17.6% as compared to the prior year. Contributors to the growth were strong sales of DARZALEX (daratumumab) driven by continued strong market growth, share gains in all regions and solid uptake of the subcutaneous formulation launched in 2020; the continued global launch uptake of ERLEADA  (apalutamide) and IMBRUVICA  (ibrutinib) growth primarily driven by market and continued share leadership. The growth of IMBRUVICA  (ibrutinib) was partially offset by competitive pressures from novel oral agents and COVID-19 related market dynamics including delays in new patient starts. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\nPulmonary Hypertension products achieved sales of $3.5 billion, representing an increase of 9.6% as compared to the prior year. Sales growth of OPSUMIT (macitentan) and UPTRAVI (selexipag) were due to continued share gains and market growth. \u00ae \u00ae\n\nCardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $4.5 billion, a decline of 8.6% as compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily attributable to lower sales of INVOKANA /INVOKAMET  (canagliflozin) due to share erosion and PROCRIT / EPREX (epoetin alfa) due to biosimilar competition. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae",

      "answer": "In 2022, STELARA was in the filing stage for the treatment of pediatric patients with juvenile psoriatic arthritis in the U.S., indicating it was under regulatory review but not yet approved. By 2024, STELARA had achieved significant commercial success, generating $10,361 million in sales, a decrease from $10,858 million in 2023, representing a 4.6% decline in total sales. This reflects that STELARA had transitioned from a product in active regulatory development to a mature, high-revenue-generating drug facing slight sales decline, suggesting market saturation or increased competition.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, STELARA was listed as being in the U.S. filing stage for a new pediatric indication, indicating ongoing regulatory activity and potential future expansion of its market.",
        "Step 2: By 2024, STELARA had become a top revenue contributor with over $10 billion in sales, though showing a slight year-over-year decline, suggesting it had reached commercial maturity.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a transformation from a product in development for a new indication to a commercially mature product with high but slightly declining sales, indicating a shift in lifecycle stage and market dynamics."

      "answer": "In 2023, Ozurdex was described as a key eye care product indicated for diabetic macular edema and retinal vein occlusion, with global commercial availability. By 2024, its total net revenue grew from $472 million to $494 million, representing a 4.5% increase at actual currency rates. This growth indicates a strengthening market position, particularly in international markets where revenue rose from $329 million to $356 million, a 8.3% increase. The product demonstrated stability and modest growth despite broader competitive pressures in the eye care space.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1: In 2023, Ozurdex was described as a key eye care product with global availability and specific therapeutic indications.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2: In 2024, financial data showed Ozurdex's total revenue increased from $472 million to $494 million, with international revenue rising from $329 million to $356 million.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change: Ozurdex experienced modest revenue growth, particularly in international markets, suggesting improved market penetration or pricing stability."

Also contributing to revenue growth in 2021 were higher sales in the virology franchise attributable to molnupiravir, higher sales in the hospital acute care franchise, reflecting growth in Bridion and Prevymis ,  as  well  as  higher sales of animal health products. Additionally, sales in 2021 benefited from higher third-party manufacturing sales and the achievement of milestones for an out-licensed product that triggered contingent payments to Merck. As discussed above, COVID-19-related disruptions unfavorably affected sales in 2021, but to a lesser extent than  in  2020,  which  benefited  year-over-year  sales  growth.  Sales  growth  in  2021  was  partially  offset  by  lower  sales  of Pneumovax 23,  the  suspension  of  sales  in  2020  of  hospital  acute  care  product Zerbaxa ,  and  lower  sales  of  virology  products Isentress/Isentress HD .\n\nSales in the U.S. grew 14% in 2021 primarily driven by higher sales of Keytruda , sales of molnupiravir, higher sales of Bridion , Gardasil 9 , Varivax and ProQuad , increased alliance revenue from Lynparza and Lenvima,",

      "question": "How did Merck's strategic emphasis on Bridion shift between 2022 and 2023, and what does this reveal about its role in the company's financial resilience versus its clinical positioning in acute care?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Bridion was listed among Merck's key products\u2014such as Keytruda, Gardasil/Gardasil 9, Lynparza, and Bravecto\u2014that were central to the company's profitability and cash flow, highlighting its financial importance. By 2023, the strategic narrative around Bridion shifted toward its clinical positioning within the Hospital Acute Care segment, where it was specifically described as a medication for the reversal of neuromuscular blocking agents used during surgery. This evolution indicates that while Bridion remained a notable product, its emphasis moved from being a contributor to financial performance to being more narrowly positioned within a specialized therapeutic area. This shift suggests a recalibration of strategic priorities, where Bridion's role may have been redefined in the context of broader portfolio dynamics and segment-specific growth strategies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Bridion was explicitly named among Merck\u2019s key products that significantly contributed to profitability and operating cash flow, indicating its strategic importance from a financial perspective.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, Bridion was described in detail within the Hospital Acute Care segment, focusing on its clinical application for reversing neuromuscular blocking agents during surgery, signaling a shift toward therapeutic specialization rather than financial prominence.",
        "Step 3: The change in framing from financial contributor to clinical utility reflects a repositioning of Bridion within Merck\u2019s broader product portfolio, potentially influenced by market dynamics, competitive pressures, or internal strategic refocusing."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nrapid loss of sales for that product as lower priced generic versions of that drug become available. In the case of products that contribute significantly to the Company's sales, the loss of market exclusivity can have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Januvia and Janumet will lose market exclusivity in the U.S. in January 2023. Januvia and Janumet will  lose  market exclusivity in the EU in September 2022 and in China in July 2022.  The  Company  anticipates  sales  of Januvia and Janumet in  these  markets  will  decline  substantially  after  the  loss  of exclusivity.\n\n## Key  products  generate  a  significant  amount  of  the  Company's  profits  and  cash  flows,  and  any  events  that adversely  affect  the  markets  for  its  leading  products  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  Company's  results  of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company's ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends largely upon the continued profitability of the Company's key products, such as Keytruda, Gardasil/Gardasil 9, Lynparza, Bravecto , and Bridion . In particular, in 2021, the Company's oncology portfolio, led by Keytruda, represented a substantial portion of the Company's revenue growth. As a result of the Company's dependence on key products, any event that adversely affects any of these products or the markets for any of these products could have a significant adverse impact on results of operations and financial condition. These events could include loss of patent protection, increased costs associated with manufacturing, generic or over-the-counter availability of the Company's product or a competitive product, the discovery of previously unknown side effects, results of post-approval trials, increased competition from the introduction of new, more effective treatments and discontinuation or removal from the market of the product for any reason. Such events could have a material adverse effect on the sales of any such products.\n\nThe  Company's  research  and  development  efforts  may  not  succeed  in  developing  commercially  successful products and the Company may not be able to acquire commercially successful products in other ways; in consequence, the Company may not be able to replace sales of successful products that lose patent protection.\n\nIn order to remain competitive, the Company, like other major pharmaceutical companies, must continue to launch new products. Expected declines in sales of products after the loss of market exclusivity mean that the Company's future success is dependent on its pipeline of new products, including new products that it may develop through collaborations and joint ventures and products that it is able to obtain through license or acquisition. To accomplish this, the Company commits substantial effort, funds  and  other  resources  to  research  and  development,  both  through  its  own  dedicated  resources  and  through  various collaborations with third parties. There is a high rate of failure inherent in the research and development process for new drugs and vaccines. As a result,  there  is  a  high  risk  that  funds  invested  by  the  Company  in  research  programs  will  not  generate  financial returns.  This  risk  profile  is  compounded  by  the  fact  that  this  research  has  a  long  investment  cycle.  To  bring  a  pharmaceutical compound from  the  discovery  phase  to  market  may  take  a  decade  or  more  and  failure  can  occur  at  any  point  in  the  process, including later in the process after significant funds have been invested.\n\nFor a description of the research and development process, see Item 1. 'Business - Research and Development' above. Each phase of testing is highly regulated and during each phase there is a substantial risk that the Company will encounter serious obstacles or will not achieve its goals. Therefore, the Company may abandon a product in which it has invested substantial amounts of time and resources. Some of the risks encountered in the research and development process include the following: pre-clinical testing of a new compound may yield disappointing results; competing products from other manufacturers may reach the market first; clinical trials of a new drug may not be successful; a new drug may not be effective or may have harmful side effects; a new drug may not be approved by the regulators for its intended use; it may not be possible to obtain a patent for a new drug; payers may refuse to cover or reimburse the new product; or sales of a new product may be disappointing.\n\nThe Company cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products now under development will be approved or launched; whether it will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire compounds, product candidates or products; or whether any products, once launched, will be commercially successful. The Company must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and successful new indications for existing products sufficient both to cover its substantial research and development costs and to replace sales that are lost as profitable products lose market exclusivity or are displaced by competing products or therapies.
