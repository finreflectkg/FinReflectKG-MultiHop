      "question": "How has PepsiCo's disclosure regarding the sensitivity of pension and retiree medical plan liabilities to market fluctuations evolved between 2022 and 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2022, PepsiCo mentioned that the exposure of pension and retiree medical plan assets and liabilities to risks related to market fluctuations was discussed in 'Our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.' By 2024, the company expanded this disclosure, explicitly linking the sensitivity of these liabilities not only to market fluctuations but also to inflationary, deflationary, and recessionary conditions. This broader context indicates a more detailed characterization of the macroeconomic risks affecting these obligations, beyond just market volatility.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, the company disclosed that pension and retiree medical plan assets and liabilities were exposed to market fluctuations, as noted in the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the company updated its disclosure to include additional macroeconomic factors\u2014specifically inflationary, deflationary, and recessionary conditions\u2014as influences on the sensitivity of these liabilities.",
        "Step 3: The evolution reflects a broader framing of risk exposure, suggesting that PepsiCo is emphasizing a more comprehensive view of external economic pressures affecting pension and retiree medical obligations."

In  fact,  our  commitment  to  freshness  and product dating serves to regulate the quantity of product shipped or delivered. In addition, DSD products are placed  on  the  shelf  by  our  employees  with  customer  shelf  space  and  storerooms  limiting  the  quantity  of product. For product delivered through other distribution networks, we monitor customer inventory levels.\n\nAs  discussed  in  'Our  Customers'  in  'Item  1.  Business,'  we  offer  sales  incentives  and  discounts  through various  programs  to  customers  and  consumers.  Total  marketplace  spending  includes  sales  incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities.\n\nA  number  of  our  sales  incentives,  such  as  bottler  funding  to  independent  bottlers  and  customer  volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for  the  expected  payout,  which  may  occur  after  year  end  once  reconciled  and  settled.  These  accruals  are based  on  contract  terms  and  our  historical  experience  with  similar  programs  and  require  management judgment  with respect to estimating customer and consumer  participation and performance  levels. Differences  between  estimated  expense  and  actual  incentive  costs  are  normally  insignificant  and  are recognized  in  earnings  in  the  period  such  differences  are  determined.  In  addition,  certain  advertising  and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred.\n\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our revenue recognition and related policies, including total marketplace spending.\n\n## Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n\nWe sell products under a number of brand names, many of which were developed by us. Brand development costs  are  expensed  as  incurred.  We  also  purchase  brands  and  other  intangible  assets  in  acquisitions.  In  a business combination, the consideration is first assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities, including brands and  other  intangible  assets,  based  on  estimated  fair  values,  with  any  excess  recorded  as  goodwill. Determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions, including those related to the COVID19 pandemic, based on an evaluation of a number of factors, such as marketplace participants, product life cycles,  market  share,  consumer  awareness,  brand  history  and  future  expansion  expectations,  amount  and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.\n\nWe believe that a brand has an indefinite life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance and we have the intent and ability to support the brand with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future. If  these  indefinite-lived  brand  criteria  are  not  met,  brands  are  amortized  over  their  expected  useful  lives, which generally range from 20 to 40 years. Determining the expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors, including market share, consumer awareness, brand  history,  future  expansion  expectations  and  regulatory  restrictions,  as  well  as  the  macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brand is sold.\n\nIn connection with previous acquisitions, we reacquired certain franchise rights which provided the exclusive and perpetual rights to manufacture and/or distribute beverages for sale in specified territories. In determining the useful life of these franchise rights, many factors were considered, including the pre-",

Consumer  incentives  include  pricing  discounts  and  prom otions,  and  other  prom otional  offers.  Advertising  support  is  directed  at  advertising programs  and  supporting  independent  bottler  m edia.  New  product  support  includes  targeted  consum er  and  retailer  incentives  and  direct marketplace  support,  such  as  point-of-purchase  m aterials,  product  placem ent  fees,  m edia  and  advertising.

However, by 2024, PepsiCo no longer had full ownership but instead held a 50% equity stake, which was remeasured at fair value, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $122 million.

Shareholders' E quity\n\nThe total authorized shares of $0.10 par value common stock is 33.0 billion, of which 8.0 billion and 8.1 billion were issued and outstanding as of January 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The total authorized shares of $0.10 par value preferred stock is 0.1 billion; none of which were issued or outstanding for any period presented.\n\n## Purchases and Sales of Subsidiary Stock\n\nDuring fiscal 2024, the Company paid $3.5 billion to acquire shares from certain Flipkart noncontrolling interest holders and settle the liability to former noncontrolling interest holders of PhonePe. The Company's ownership of Flipkart increased from approximately 75% as of January 31, 2023 to approximately 85% as of January 31, 2024.\n\nAlso during fiscal 2024, the Company received $0.7 billion related to new rounds of equity funding for the Company's majority owned PhonePe subsidiary, which decreased the Company's ownership from approximately 89% as of January 31, 2023 to approximately 84% as of January 31, 2024.\n\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Company completed a $0.4 billion buyout of the noncontrolling interest shareholders of the Company's Massmart subsidiary. This transaction increased the Company's ownership in Massmart from approximately 53% to 100%. Additionally, the Company completed a $0.4 billion acquisition of Alert Innovation, which was previously consolidated as a variable interest entity, and resulted in the Company becoming a 100% owner. This entity was subsequently sold and deconsolidated in fiscal 2025.\n\nAlso during fiscal 2023, the Company increased its ownership in PhonePe from approximately 76% to approximately 89% as part of the separation from the Company's majority-owned Flipkart subsidiary. In consideration for the transaction, the Company initially recorded a liability to noncontrolling interest holders of $0.9 billion within accrued liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2023, which was paid during fiscal 2024.\n\n## Share-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company has awarded share-based compensation to associates and nonemployee directors of the Company. The compensation expense recognized for all stock incentive plans, including expense associated with plans of the Company's consolidated subsidiaries granted in the subsidiaries' respective stock, was $2.8 billion, $2.1 billion and $1.6 billion for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Share-based compensation ex pense is generally included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The total income tax benefit recognized for share-based compensation was $0.7 billion, $0.5 billion and $0.4 billion for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

      "question": "How did Walmart's treatment of its Deferred Compensation Matching Plan evolve between the 2023 and 2024 10-K filings, particularly in terms of its documentation status and effective date?",
      "answer": "In the 2023 10-K filing, the Deferred Compensation Matching Plan was newly introduced as 'Walmart Inc. Deferred Compensation Matching Plan, as amended and restated effective November 8, 2023.' By the 2024 10-K filing, the plan was no longer labeled as newly introduced but was instead referenced as being 'incorporated by reference' to the 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K, indicating that it had become an established, ongoing plan. The effective date remained unchanged at November 8, 2023, suggesting no substantive changes to the plan\u2019s implementation timeline, but its treatment shifted from being newly introduced to being formally integrated into the company's long-term compensation framework.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, the Deferred Compensation Matching Plan was newly introduced with an effective date of November 8, 2023, indicating its first-time disclosure.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the same plan was referenced by incorporation from the 2024 10-K, showing it had become a standard part of the company's disclosures and governance structure.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a shift from introduction to institutionalization, with no changes to the plan\u2019s effective date or structure."

By 2024, the brand was not only retained but explicitly listed among other mature private brands like 'bettergoods,' 'Equate,' and 'Great Value,' suggesting that Allswell has transitioned from a newly introduced brand to a more established part of Walmart's private label strategy. This evolution indicates that Allswell has likely gained traction and is being positioned as a core component of Walmart\u2019s private brand portfolio.",

When revisions are made, the previous periods' presentation is adjusted to maintain comparability.\n\nBrand name merchandise represents a significant portion of the merchandise sold in Walmart U.S. We also market lines of merchandise under our private brands, including brands such as: \"Allswell,\" \"Athletic Works,\" \"bettergoods,\" \"Equate,\" \"Free Assembly,\" \"Freshness Guaranteed,\" \"George,\" \"Great Value,\" \"Holiday Time,\" \"Hyper Tough,\" \"Mainstays,\" \"Marketside,\" \"No Boundaries,\" \"onn.,\" \"Ozark Trail,\" \"Parent's Choice,\" \"Sam's Choice,\" \"Scoop,\" \"Spring Valley,\" \"Time and Tru,\" \"Way to Celebrate\" and \"Wonder Nation.\" The Company also markets lines of merchandise under licensed brands, some of which include: \"Avia,\" \"Better Homes &amp; Gardens,\" \"Sofia Jeans by Sofia Vergara,\" and \"The Pioneer Woman.\"\n\nOther offerings in the Walmart U.S. business include in-house advertising for brands and online marketplace sellers, supply chain and fulfillment capabilities to online marketplace sellers, and data analytics and insights for merchants and suppliers.

We continue to invest in supply chain automation and utilize a total of 164 distribution facilities which are located strategically throughout the U.S. For fiscal 2025, the majority of Walmart U.S.'s purchases of store merchandise were shipped through these facilities, while most of the remaining store merchandise we purchased was shipped directly from suppliers. General merchandise and dry grocery merchandise is transported primarily through the segment's private truck fleet; however, we contract with common carriers to transport the majority of our perishable grocery merchandise. We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations by leveraging our ability to deliver directly from stores and shipping from our 29 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers.",

Fiscal 2024 net cash used in financing activities decreased $3.6 billion when compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to fewer share repurchases, partially offset by the purchase of certain noncontrolling interests.\n\n## Purchase and Sale of Subsidiary Stoc k\n\nDuring fiscal 2024, we paid $3.5 billion to acquire shares from certain Flipkart noncontrolling interest holders and settle the liability to former noncontrolling interest holders of PhonePe. Additionally, we received $0.7 billion related to new rounds of equity funding for the Company's majority owned PhonePe subsidiary.\n\nDuring fiscal 2023, we completed a $0.4 billion buyout of the noncontrolling interest shareholders of our Massmart subsidiary and completed a $0.4 billion acquisition of Alert Innovation, bringing our ownership to approximately 100% of both Massmart and Alert Innovation.

Shareholders' E quity\n\nThe total authorized shares of $0.10 par value common stock is 33.0 billion, of which 8.0 billion and 8.1 billion were issued and outstanding as of January 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The total authorized shares of $0.10 par value preferred stock is 0.1 billion; none of which were issued or outstanding for any period presented.\n\n## Purchases and Sales of Subsidiary Stock\n\nDuring fiscal 2024, the Company paid $3.5 billion to acquire shares from certain Flipkart noncontrolling interest holders and settle the liability to former noncontrolling interest holders of PhonePe. The Company's ownership of Flipkart increased from approximately 75% as of January 31, 2023 to approximately 85% as of January 31, 2024.\n\nAlso during fiscal 2024, the Company received $0.7 billion related to new rounds of equity funding for the Company's majority owned PhonePe subsidiary, which decreased the Company's ownership from approximately 89% as of January 31, 2023 to approximately 84% as of January 31, 2024.\n\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Company completed a $0.4 billion buyout of the noncontrolling interest shareholders of the Company's Massmart subsidiary. This transaction increased the Company's ownership in Massmart from approximately 53% to 100%. Additionally, the Company completed a $0.4 billion acquisition of Alert Innovation, which was previously consolidated as a variable interest entity, and resulted in the Company becoming a 100% owner. This entity was subsequently sold and deconsolidated in fiscal 2025.\n\nAlso during fiscal 2023, the Company increased its ownership in PhonePe from approximately 76% to approximately 89% as part of the separation from the Company's majority-owned Flipkart subsidiary. In consideration for the transaction, the Company initially recorded a liability to noncontrolling interest holders of $0.9 billion within accrued liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2023, which was paid during fiscal 2024.\n\n## Share-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company has awarded share-based compensation to associates and nonemployee directors of the Company. The compensation expense recognized for all stock incentive plans, including expense associated with plans of the Company's consolidated subsidiaries granted in the subsidiaries' respective stock, was $2.8 billion, $2.1 billion and $1.6 billion for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Share-based compensation ex pense is generally included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The total income tax benefit recognized for share-based compensation was $0.7 billion, $0.5 billion and $0.4 billion for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

      "answer": "In 2023, Coca-Cola FEMSA was one of The Coca-Cola Company's five largest independent bottling partners, operating in multiple countries including Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina, and collectively these top five bottlers accounted for 42% of Coca-Cola's worldwide unit case volume. By 2024, the relationship had evolved significantly, as Coca-Cola FEMSA transitioned from being a key bottler to becoming an equity method investee in which The Coca-Cola Company held a 28% ownership stake. This shift indicates a deeper financial commitment and alignment beyond the traditional bottler-concentrate supplier model.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2023, Coca-Cola FEMSA was identified as a major independent bottling partner, with a significant role in global unit case volume distribution.",
        "In 2024, The Coca-Cola Company disclosed a 28% ownership interest in Coca-Cola FEMSA, reclassifying it as an equity method investee rather than an independent bottler.",
        "This transition from a contractual bottling relationship to a partial ownership stake represents a strategic evolution toward greater integration and shared value creation."

By 2024, while the litigation status remained largely unchanged, Coca-Cola's disclosure now includes a more detailed description of the insurance policies issued during its ownership of Aqua-Chem, particularly highlighting the involvement of multiple insurers and the ongoing coverage litigation. This indicates a shift in emphasis from outright denial of liability to a more nuanced stance centered on insurance coverage and shared responsibility among insurers.",

The extent of utilization of our production facilities varies based upon seasonal demand for our products. However, management believes that, with the exception of certain dairy products that require specialized equipment, additional production can be achieved at the existing facilities by adding personnel and capital equipment or, at some facilities, by adding shifts of personnel or expanding the facilities. The Company is in the process of increasing our dairy production capacity. We continuously review our anticipated requirements for facilities and, on the basis of that review, may from time to time acquire or lease additional facilities and/or dispose of ex isting facilities.\n\n## ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n\nThe Company is involved in various legal proceedings, including the proceedings specifically discussed below. Management believes that, ex cept as disclosed in 'U.S. Federal Income Tax Dispute' below, the total liabilities of the Company that may arise as a result of currently pending legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company taken as a whole.\n\n## Aqua-Chem Litigation\n\nOn December 20, 2002, the Company filed a lawsuit (The Coca-Cola Company v. Aqua-Chem, Inc., Civil Action No. 2002CV631-50) in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia ('Georgia Case'), seeking a declaratory judgment that the Company has no obligation to its former subsidiary, Aqua-Chem, Inc., now known as Cleaver-Brooks, Inc. ('Aqua-Chem'), for any past, present or future liabilities or ex penses in connection with any claims or lawsuits against Aqua-Chem. Subsequent to the Company's filing but on the same day, Aqua-Chem filed a lawsuit (Aqua-Chem, Inc. v. The Coca-Cola Company, Civil Action No. 02CV012179) in the Circuit Court, Civil Division of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin ('Wisconsin Case'). In the Wisconsin Case, Aqua-Chem sought a declaratory judgment that the Company is responsible for all liabilities and ex penses not covered by insurance in connection with certain of Aqua-Chem's general and product liability claims arising from occurrences prior to the Company's sale of Aqua-Chem in 1981, and a judgment for breach of contract in an amount exceeding $9 million for costs incurred by AquaChem to date in connection with such claims. The Wisconsin Case initially was stayed, pending final resolution of the Georgia Case, and later was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice by Aqua-Chem.\n\nThe Company owned Aqua-Chem from 1970 to 1981. During that time, the Company purchased over $400 million of insurance coverage, which also insures AquaChem for some of its prior and future costs for certain product liability and other claims. The Company sold Aqua-Chem to Lyonnaise American Holding, Inc., in 1981 under the terms of a stock sale agreement. The 1981 agreement, and a subsequent 1983 settlement agreement, outlined the parties' rights and obligations concerning past and future claims and lawsuits involving Aqua-Chem. Cleaver-Brooks, a division of Aqua-Chem, manufactured boilers, some of which contained asbestos gaskets. Aqua-Chem was first named as a defendant in asbestos lawsuits in or around 1985 and currently has approximately 15,000 active claims pending against it.\n\nThe parties agreed in 2004 to stay the Georgia Case pending the outcome of insurance coverage litigation filed by certain Aqua-Chem insurers on March 26, 2004. In the coverage action, five plaintiff insurance companies filed suit (Century Indemnity Company, et al. v. Aqua-Chem, Inc., The Coca-Cola Company, et al., Case No. 04CV002852) in the Circuit Court, Civil Division of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, against the Company, Aqua-Chem and 16 insurance companies. Several of the policies that were the subject of the coverage action had been issued to the Company during the period (1970 to 1981) when the Company owned Aqua-Chem. The complaint sought a determination of the respective rights and obligations under the insurance policies issued with regard to asbestos-related claims against AquaChem. The action also sought a monetary judgment reimbursing any amounts paid by the plaintiffs in excess of their obligations. Two of the insurers, one with a",

          "chunk_text": "## Captive Insurance Companies\n\nIn accordance with local insurance regulations, our consolidated captive insurance companies are required to meet and maintain minimum solvency capital requirements. The Company elected to invest a majority of its solvency capital in a portfolio of marketable equity and debt securities. These securities are included in the disclosures above. The Company uses one of our consolidated captive insurance companies to reinsure group annuity insurance contracts that cover the obligations of certain of our European and Canadian pension plans. This captive's solvency capital funds included total equity and debt securities of $1,883 million and $1,643 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which were classified in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets because the assets were not available to satisfy our current obligations.\n\n## NOTE 5: HEDGING TRANSACTIONS AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\nThe Company is directly and indirectly affected by changes in certain market conditions. These changes in market conditions may adversely impact the Company's financial performance and are referred to as 'market risks.' When deemed appropriate, our Company uses derivatives as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks. The primary market risks managed by the Company through the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments are foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk and interest rate risk.\n\nThe Company uses various types of derivative instruments, including, but not limited to, forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps. Forward contracts and commodity futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined future date and at a predetermined rate or price. An option contract is an agreement that conveys the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined rate or price during a period or at a time in the future. A collar is a strategy that uses a combination of options to limit the range of possible positive or negative returns on an underlying asset or liability to a specific range, or to protect ex pected future cash flows. To do this, an investor simultaneously buys a put option and sells (writes) a call option, or alternatively buys a call option and sells (writes) a put option. A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The Company may also designate certain non-derivative instruments, such as our foreign currency denominated third-party debt, in hedging relationships.\n\nAll derivative instruments are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily in the following line items, as applicable: prepaid ex penses and other current assets; other noncurrent assets; accounts payable and accrued expenses; and other noncurrent liabilities. The carrying values of the derivatives reflect the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparties, as applicable. These master netting agreements allow the Company to net settle positive and negative positions (assets and liabilities) arising from different transactions with the same counterparty.\n\nThe accounting for gains and losses that result from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives have been designated and qualify as hedging instruments and the type of hedging relationships. Derivatives can be designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that have been designated and qualify for fair value hedge accounting are recorded in the same line item in our consolidated statement of income as the changes in the fair values of the hedged items attributable to the risk being hedged. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into the line item in our consolidated statement of income in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. Due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures being hedged, fluctuations in the values of the derivative instruments are generally offset by changes in the fair values or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that were not designated and/or did not qualify as hedging instruments are immediately recognized in earnings.\n\nFor derivatives that will be accounted for as hedging instruments, the Company formally designates and documents, at inception, the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure, the risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. In addition, the Company formally assesses, both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair values or cash flows of the related underlying exposures.\n\nThe Company determines the fair values of its derivatives based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. Refer to Note 17. The notional amounts of the derivative financial instruments do not necessarily represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, therefore, are not a direct measure of our exposure to the financial risks described above. The amounts exchanged are calculated by reference to the notional amounts and by other terms of the derivatives, such as interest rates, foreign currency ex change rates, commodity rates or other financial indices. The Company does not view the fair",

      "answer": "In 2023, Coca-Cola FEMSA was referenced as one of the key bottlers whose financial performance could influence The Coca-Cola Company's credit ratings, indicating an indirect financial dependency. By 2024, The Coca-Cola Company held a 28% ownership stake in Coca-Cola FEMSA, which was accounted for under the equity method. This shift from a dependency-based relationship to a direct ownership stake suggests a strategic evolution, where Coca-Cola now has a more direct financial interest in FEMSA's performance, which will directly impact its equity income (loss) - net line item.",

          "chunk_text": "\nCertain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment should be assessed, including, among others, a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in the business climate in a particular market, or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses or projected future losses. When such events or changes in circumstances are present and a recoverability test is performed, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the ex pected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment charge. The impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of property, plant and equipment, including appraisals and discounted cash flow models. These appraisals and models include assumptions we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use.\n\n## Goodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets\n\nWe classify intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill. We determine the useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets after considering the specific facts and circumstances related to each intangible asset. Factors we consider when determining useful lives include the contractual term of any agreement related to the asset, the historical performance of the asset, the Company's long-term strategy for using the asset, any laws or other local regulations which could impact the useful life of the asset, and other economic factors, including competition and specific market conditions. Intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized, primarily on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, which is less than 20 years.\n\nWhen events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable, management performs a recoverability test of the carrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting profit and cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment charge. The impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of these assets, including discounted cash flow models, which include assumptions we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use.\n\nWe test intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, including trademarks, franchise rights and goodwill, for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. Our Company performs these annual impairment tests as of the first day of our third fiscal quarter. We perform impairment tests using various valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flow models and a market approach, to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset or the reporting unit, as applicable. We believe our assumptions are consistent with those a market participant would use. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount ex ceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, rather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing described above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any further assessment.\n\nWe perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is generally one level below our operating segments. Our operating segments are primarily based on geographic responsibility, which is consistent with the way management runs our business. Our geographic operating segments are generally subdivided into smaller geographic regions. These geographic regions are our reporting units. Our Global Ventures operating segment includes the results of our Costa Limited ('Costa'), innocent and do\u011fadan businesses, as well as fees earned pursuant to distribution coordination agreements",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, Procter & Gamble incurred restructuring costs within its historical range of $250 to $500 million before tax, with $147 million in restructuring accruals as of June 30, 2022. Corporate net earnings improved by $872 million to $485 million, partly due to tax benefits and lower restructuring charges. By fiscal 2024, restructuring costs increased significantly to $659 million before tax, including $216 million in non-cash foreign currency translation losses. Corporate net earnings decreased by $1.0 billion, largely due to the $1.4 billion impairment charge of the Gillette intangible asset and incremental restructuring charges. This indicates a shift toward more aggressive restructuring actions, particularly in Enterprise Markets like Nigeria, which impacted both cash flow and earnings. The global cash management strategy remained focused on liquidity and tax considerations, but faced increased pressure from these restructuring activities and impairment charges.",

Corporate  net earnings  improved  by  $872  million  to  $485  million  in  fiscal 2022  due  primarily  to  the  prior  year  loss  on  the  early  debt extinguishment,  a  current  year  gain  on  the  divestiture  of  a minor  business,  net  sales  growth,  current  year  tax  benefits (primarily higher excess tax benefits of share-based compensation) and lower restructuring charges, partially offset by  increased  commodity  costs  tied  to  the  aforementioned incidental businesses.\n\n## Restructuring  Program  to  Deliver  Productivity  and  Cost Savings\n\nThe  Company  has  historically  had  an  ongoing  restructuring program with  annual  spending  in  the  range  of  $250  to  $500 million.

The most notable ongoing reconciling item is income taxes, which adjusts the blended statutory rates that are reflected in the reportable segments to the overall Company effective tax rate.\n\nCorporate net sales decreased $164 million to $601 million due to a decrease in net sales of incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Corporate net earnings decreased $1.0 billion due to a loss of $1.4 billion due primarily to the impairment charge of the G illette intangible asset and incremental restructuring charges.\n\n## Restructuring Program to Deliver Productivity and Cost Savings\n\nThe Company has historically had an ongoing restructuring program with annual spending in the range of $250 to $500 million before tax. On December 5, 2023, the Company announced an incremental limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, the Company incurred before tax restructuring costs of $659 million, which include foreign currency translation losses recognized as a non-cash charge of approximately $216 million due to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. Restructuring accruals of $166 million as of June 30, 2024, are classified as current liabilities. Ex cluding the non-cash charges of foreign currency translation losses for certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria,  approximately  64%  of  the  restructuring  charges  incurred  in  fiscal  2024  either  have  been  or  will  be  settled  with  cash.  Consistent  with  our  policies  for restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting.\n\nSavings generated from the Company's restructuring program are difficult to estimate, given the nature of the activities, the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment.

      "answer": "In 2022, the Worldwide Business Conduct Manual was described as reinforcing the company's commitment to conducting business with integrity and within the letter and spirit of the law, emphasizing its role in supporting internal controls through policies, segregation of duties, and employee development. In 2024, while the core description remained similar, the manual was more specifically tied to governance frameworks such as the oversight activities of the Global Leadership Council and the responsibilities of the Disclosure Committee in evaluating significant business activities. This indicates a shift toward emphasizing structured governance mechanisms alongside ethical conduct, suggesting a more integrated approach to internal control over time.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Procter & Gamble identified membership club stores as one of its key retail channels, listing them among a broad set of distribution partners such as mass merchandisers, grocery stores, and e-commerce platforms. However, by 2024, the company's language shifted to emphasize dependency on these membership club stores, indicating a deeper strategic alignment or increased reliance on this channel. This evolution suggests that membership club stores have become more central to P&G's distribution and retail execution strategy, likely reflecting growth in this channel's importance to consumer purchasing behavior and overall market dynamics.",

Business.\n\nThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company (the Company) is focused on providing  branded  products  of  superior  quality  and  value  to improve  the  lives  of  the  world's  consumers,  now  and  for generations to come. The Company was incorporated in Ohio in 1905,  having  first  been  established  as  a  New  Jersey corporation in 1890, and was built from a business founded in Cincinnati  in  1837  by  William  Procter  and  James  Gamble. Today,  our  products  are  sold  in  approximately  180  countries and territories.\n\nAdditional  information  required  by  this  item  is  incorporated herein by reference to Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&amp;A);  and  Notes  1  and  2  to  our  Consolidated  Financial Statements. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms the  \"Company,\"  \"P&amp;G,\"  \"we,\"  \"our\"  or  \"us\"  as  used  herein refer to The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (the registrant) and its subsidiaries.\n\nThroughout  this  Form  10-K,  we  incorporate  by  reference information  from  other  documents  filed  with  the  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe  Company's  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K,  quarterly reports  on  Form  10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments thereto, are filed electronically with the SEC. The SEC maintains an internet site that  contains  these  reports  at: www.sec.gov. Reports can also be accessed through links from our website at: www.pginvestor.com. P&amp;G  includes the website  link  solely  as  a  textual  reference.  The  information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into this report.\n\nCopies of these reports are also available, without charge, by contacting EQ  Shareowner  Services, 1100  Centre Pointe Curve, Suite 101, Mendota, MN 55120-4100.\n\n## Financial Information about Segments\n\nInformation about our reportable segments can be found in the MD&amp;A and Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Narrative Description of Business\n\nBusiness Model .  Our business model relies on the continued growth and success of existing brands and products, as well as the  creation  of  new  innovative  products  and  brands.  The markets and industry segments in which we offer our products are highly competitive. Our products are sold in approximately 180  countries  and  territories  through  numerous  channels  as well  as  direct-to-consumer.  Our  growth  strategy  is  to  deliver meaningful and noticeable superiority across five key vectors of our consumer proposition -product performance, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and consumer  and  customer  value.  We  use  our  research  and development (R&amp;D) and consumer insights to provide superior products and packaging. We utilize our marketing and online  presence  to  deliver  superior  brand  messaging  to  our consumers.  We  work  collaboratively  with  our  customers  to deliver  superior  retail  execution,  both  in-store  and  online.  In conjunction with the above vectors, we provide superior value to consumers and our retail customers in each price tier in which we  compete.  Productivity  improvement  is  also  critical  to delivering  our  objectives  of  balanced  top  and  bottom-line growth and value creation.\n\nKey Product Categories . Information on key product categories  can  be  found  in  the  MD&amp;A  and  Note  2  to  our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nKey Customers .  Our customers include mass merchandisers, e-commerce  (including  social  commerce)  channels,  grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors,  wholesalers,  specialty  beauty  stores  (including airport  duty-free  stores),  high-frequency  stores,  pharmacies, electronics  stores  and  professional  channels.  We  also  sell direct  to  consumers.  Sales  to  Walmart  Inc.  and  its  affiliates represent approximately 15% of our total sales in 2022, 2021 and 2020. No other customer represents more than 10% of our total sales. Our top ten customers accounted for approximately 39% of our total sales in 2022, 39% in 2021 and 38% in 2020.\n\nSources and Availability of Materials . Almost all of the raw and packaging materials used by the Company are purchased from third parties, some of whom are single-source suppliers. We  produce  certain  raw  materials,  primarily  chemicals,  for further  use  in  the  manufacturing  process.  In  addition,  fuel, natural gas and derivative products are important commodities consumed in our manufacturing processes and in the transportation  of  input  materials  and  finished  products.  The prices we pay for materials and other commodities are subject to fluctuation. When prices for these items change, we may or may  not  pass  the  change  to  our  customers.  The  Company purchases  a  substantial  variety  of  other  raw  and  packaging materials, none of which are material to our business taken as a whole.\n\nTrademarks  and  Patents .  We  own  or  have  licenses  under patents and registered trademarks, which are used in connection with our activity in all businesses. Some of these patents  or  licenses  cover  significant  product  formulation  and processes  used  to  manufacture  our  products.  The  trademarks are  important  to  the  overall  marketing  and  branding  of  our products. All major trademarks in each business are registered. In  part,  our  success  can  be  attributed  to  the  existence  and continued protection of these trademarks, patents and licenses.\n\nCompetitive Condition .  The  markets  in  which  our  products are sold are highly competitive. Our products compete against similar products of many large and small companies, including well-known  global  competitors.  In  many  of  the  markets  and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against  other  branded  products  as  well  as  retailers'  privatelabel brands. We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant  market  share  position.  We  support  our  products with advertising, promotions and other marketing vehicles to build awareness",

Inflation pressures sometimes result in increases in these input costs. Therefore, our business results depend, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost saving projects and sourcing decisions, while maintaining and improving margins and market share. Failure to manage these fluctuations and to anticipate consumer reaction to our management of these fluctuations could adversely impact our results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## The ability to achieve our business objectives depends on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels.\n\nThe consumer products industry is highly competitive. Across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. As a result, we experience ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate, which may result in challenges in maintaining sales and profit margins. To address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends, including pricing, promotional incentives, product delivery windows and trade terms. In addition, evolving sales channels and business models may affect customer and consumer preferences as well as market dynamics, which, for example, may be seen in the growing consumer preference for shopping online, ease of competitive entry into certain categories and growth in hard discounter channels. Failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends and effectively compete in growing sales channels and business models, particularly e-commerce and mobile or social commerce applications, could negatively impact our results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## A significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business.\n\nWe sell most of our products via retail customers, which include mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics  stores  and  professional  channels.  Our  success  depends  on  our  ability  to  successfully  manage  relationships  with  our  retail  trade  customers,  which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business, and our business performance could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer on trade terms and principles. Our business could also be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level of or shelf space allocated to our products as a result of increased offerings of other branded manufacturers, private label brands and generic non-branded products or for other reasons, significantly tighten product delivery windows or experience a significant business disruption.\n\n## If the reputation of the Company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results.\n\nThe Company's reputation, and the reputation of our brands, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including consumers, customers and suppliers. The quality and safety of our products are critical to our business. Many of our brands have worldwide recognition and our financial success directly depends on the success of our brands. The success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. Our results of operations or cash flows could also be negatively impacted if the Company or one of our brands suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to a significant product recall, product-related litigation, defects or impurities in our products, product misuse, changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients, negative perceptions of packaging (such as plastic and other petroleum-based materials), lack of recyclability  or  other  environmental  attributes,  concerns  about  actual  or  alleged  labor  or  equality  and  inclusion  practices,  privacy  failures  or  data  breaches, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. Additionally, negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the Company. If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality, ingredients, efficacy, environmental or social impacts or similar matters, sentiments toward the Company or our products could be negatively impacted, and our results of operations or cash flows could suffer. Our Company also devotes time and resources to citizenship efforts that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to strengthen our business and protect and preserve our reputation, including programs driving ethics and corporate responsibility, strong communities, equality and inclusion and environmental sustainability.

      "question": "How has the treatment of the 2019 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan evolved between 2022 and 2024 in Procter & Gamble's disclosures, particularly regarding its relationship with other compensation plans and its role in equity compensation?",
      "answer": "In 2022, the 2019 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan was disclosed as part of a broader set of compensation plans, with specific reference to its adoption by shareholders in 2019 and its regulation in conjunction with other plans like the 2014 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan. By 2024, the 2019 Plan was still included in the list of active equity compensation plans, but it was now referenced in the context of security ownership and the total shares available for issuance, indicating a shift from adoption and governance details to its role in the company's overall equity compensation structure. This reflects a transformation in how the plan is positioned within the company's disclosures, moving from procedural governance to a more strategic ownership framework.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2022, the 2019 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan was disclosed with emphasis on its adoption date (October 8, 2019) and regulatory framework alongside the 2014 Plan.",
        "In 2024, the same plan was referenced in the context of equity compensation securities, specifically in relation to shares that may be issued upon exercise of options, indicating a shift in focus.",
        "The evolution shows a transformation from procedural governance disclosure to a strategic ownership and compensation tool, with a moderate change in emphasis."

      "answer": "The retail share of Skoal oral tobacco products decreased from 9.3% in 2023 to 7.6% in 2024, reflecting a decline in market presence. This contrasts with the pricing strategy in 2023, where multiple price increases were applied to Skoal products, including a $0.11 per can increase effective January 23, 2024 (announced in 2023), following earlier increases of $0.09, $0.09, and $0.08 per can in May, February, and January 2022, respectively. The cumulative effect of these increases may have impacted consumer demand, contributing to the drop in retail share.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, multiple price increases were applied to Skoal products, with the final one in January 2024 (announced in 2023) raising prices by $0.11 per can, following earlier increases.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the retail share of Skoal decreased to 7.6%, down from 9.3% in 2023, indicating a loss of market presence.",
        "Step 3: The decline in retail share contrasts with the aggressive pricing strategy in 2023, suggesting a potential negative impact of repeated price hikes on Skoal's competitiveness in the oral tobacco market."

The current equity/fix ed income target allocation of 20%/80% is designed to balance pension liability hedging and asset growth in order to maintain our plan's funded status and cover incremental service accruals and interest cost. Liability hedging is achieved through investing in rate-sensitive fixed income securities, primarily corporate bonds and U.S. Treasuries, while growth assets are comprised of publicly traded equity securities.\n\nOur investment strategy for our postretirement plan assets is intended to maximize our total asset return based on the expectation that equity securities will outperform debt securities over the long term and reflects the maturity structure of our benefit obligation. The equity/fix ed income target allocation for postretirement plan assets is 55%/45%.\n\nWe believe that we implement these investment strategies in a prudent and risk-controlled manner, consistent with the fiduciary requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, by investing retirement plan assets in a well-diversified mix of equities, fix ed income and other securities.\n\nThe actual composition of our plan assets at December 31, 2024 was broadly characterized with the following allocation:\n\n",

This indicates that Altria continued to maintain significant uncertainty regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets associated with the Cronos investment, as the company still did not expect the temporary difference to reverse in the foreseeable future.

We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. We determine the realizability of deferred tax  assets based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence. In reaching this determination, we consider the character of the assets and the possible sources of taxable income of the appropriate character within the available carryback and carryforward periods available under the tax law. As has occurred in prior periods, there is a potential that sufficient positive evidence may be available in future periods to cause us to reduce or eliminate the valuation allowance on certain deferred tax  assets. That change to the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of previously unrecognized deferred tax assets and a decrease in income tax expense in the period the release is recorded.\n\nThe additions to valuation allowances during 2024 were due primarily to deferred tax assets recorded in connection with our JUUL-related capital loss carryforwards. The reductions to valuation allowances during 2024 were due primarily to the $4.0 billion of ordinary losses recognized as part of the IRS Agreement, the reduction of a deferred tax  asset for the portion of our JUUL-related capital losses that is now part of our tax  basis in the shares of a domestic subsidiary and the ABI Transaction. This outside basis difference of the domestic subsidiary is not recognized as a deferred tax asset since we do not expect the temporary difference to reverse in the foreseeable future. The cumulative valuation allowance at December 31, 2024 was primarily attributable to deferred tax assets recorded in connection with our investment in Cronos ($402 million) and our JUUL-related capital loss carryforwards ($207 million).\n\nThe additions to valuation allowances during 2023 were due primarily to deferred tax assets recorded in connection with our former investment in JUUL. The reductions to valuation allowances during 2023 were due primarily to the reduction of a deferred tax asset for the portion of our JUUL capital losses that is now part of our tax basis in the shares of a foreign subsidiary. This outside basis difference of the foreign subsidiary is not recognized as a deferred tax  asset since we do not expect the temporary difference to reverse in the foreseeable future. The cumulative valuation allowance at December 31, 2023 was primarily attributable to deferred tax assets recorded in connection with our tax basis in the shares of a domestic subsidiary ($1,808 million) and our investment in Cronos ($397 million).\n\nThe additions to valuation allowances during 2022 were due primarily to deferred tax assets recorded in connection with decreases in the estimated fair value of our former investment in JUUL. The reductions to valuation allowances during 2022 were due primarily to the anticipated ability to utilize a portion of existing losses related to our former investment in JUUL and the abandonment of our Cronos warrant. The cumulative valuation allowance at December 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to deferred tax  assets recorded in connection with our former investment in JUUL ($2,394 million) and our investment in Cronos ($379 million).\n\nFor a discussion regarding our former investment in JUUL and current investments in ABI and Cronos, see Note 8.

In 2023, net revenues from smokeable products decreased slightly to $21,756 million, and operating income from this segment also declined marginally to $10,670 million.

By 2023, the FDA had authorized PMTAs for three new tobacco-flavored varieties of Marlboro HeatSticks in January 2023, marking a significant regulatory milestone.

For a further discussion of risks associated with the agreements with PMI, see Risks Related to Our Businesses in Item 1A.\n\nIn October 2021, the FDA authorized the marketing and sale of four of USSTC's Verve oral nicotine products, including Green Mint and Blue Mint varieties, representing the first flavored product authorizations issued by the FDA for newly deemed innovative products. These products are not currently marketed or sold.\n\nPost-Market Surveillance : Manufacturers that receive product authorizations through the PMTA process must submit to the FDA postmarket records and reports, as detailed in market orders. This includes notification of all marketing activities. The IQOS Tobacco Heating System is subject to this post-market surveillance requirement. The FDA may amend requirements of a market order or withdraw the market order based on this information if, among other reasons, it determines that the continued marketing of the products is no longer appropriate for the protection of the public health.\n\nEffect of Adverse FDA Determinations : FDA review time frames have varied. It is therefore difficult to predict the duration of FDA reviews of SE reports or PMTAs. Failure of manufacturers to submit applications by the applicable deadline, an unfavorable determination on an application or the withdrawal by the FDA of a prior marketing order could result in the removal of products from the market. These manufacturers would have the option of marketing products that have received FDA pre-market authorization or Grandfathered Products. A 'not substantially equivalent' determination, a denial of a PMTA or a marketing order withdrawal by the FDA on one or more products (which would require the removal of the product or products from the market) could have a material adverse impact on the business and consolidated results of operations of our tobacco operating companies and investees, and the cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL. Also, an adverse FDA determination on one or more innovative tobacco products could impede our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\n## \u25aa FDA Regulatory Actions\n\n- Graphic Warnings : In March 2020, the FDA issued a final rule requiring 11 textual warnings accompanied by color graphics depicting certain negative health consequences of smoking on cigarette packaging and advertising. As a result of a March 2021 court order related to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent court orders resulting from a lawsuit brought by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and others against the FDA, the final rule is presently anticipated to become effective on April 9, 2023. PM USA and other cigarette manufacturers have filed lawsuits challenging the final rule on substantive and procedural grounds.\n- In the preamble to the final rule, the FDA stated that it would not exempt Marlboro HeatSticks , a heated tobacco product used with the IQOS devices, as part of the rulemaking, but would consider the Marlboro HeatSticks marketing order, and other marketing orders, on a case-by-case basis. To date, the FDA has not taken any action to exempt Marlboro HeatSticks from the graphic health warnings requirements.\n- Underage Access and Use of Certain Tobacco Products : The FDA announced regulatory actions in September 2018 to address underage access and use of e-vapor products. Altria has engaged with the FDA on this topic and has reaffirmed to the FDA its ongoing and long-standing commitment to preventing underage use. For example, during 2019, Altria advocated raising the minimum legal age to purchase all tobacco products to 21 at the federal and state levels to further address underage use, which is now federal law. See Federal, State and Local Legislation to Increase the Legal Age to Purchase Tobacco Products below for further discussion.\n- Additionally, the FDA issued final guidance in April 2020, stating that it intends to prioritize enforcement action against certain product categories, including cartridge-based, flavored e-vapor products and products targeted to minors.\n- Flavored Electronic Nicotine Delivery System ('ENDS') Products: Some e-vapor product manufacturers filed PMTAs for flavored tobacco products. As of February 22, 2022, many of these manufacturers received marketing denial orders for failure to provide sufficiently strong product-specific scientific evidence to demonstrate that the benefit of their products to adult smokers overcomes the risk that their products pose to youth. FDA has communicated in these marketing denial orders that vapor products with non-tobacco flavors present unique questions relevant to the FDA's 'Appropriate for the Protection of Public Health' standard and that successful applications will require strong, product-specific evidence. A number of manufacturers are appealing the marketing denial orders for their products. If the FDA does not ultimately allow for the reintroduction of flavors other than tobacco, it could adversely affect the value of Altria's investment in JUUL.\n- Some ENDS manufacturers, including some that have received marketing denial orders, have indicated their intention to market ENDS products containing synthetically-derived nicotine, which is not currently FDA-regulated. If these products are sold in higher volumes, and marketed outside of FDA oversight, it could adversely affect the value of Altria's investment in JUUL, have a material adverse effect on Altria's consolidated financial position or earnings and adversely affect Altria's ability to achieve its Vision.",

Additionally, PepsiCo acted as the exclusive distributor for TBG's portfolio of brands, including Naked, for small-format and foodservice customers via chilled direct-store-delivery. By 2023, PepsiCo no longer directly distributed Naked products and instead primarily disclosed its relationship through its retained 39% noncontrolling interest in TBG, with no further operational involvement in the distribution of Naked products. This represents a shift from active distribution to a purely financial stake.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, PepsiCo sold Naked to PAI Partners but retained a 39% noncontrolling interest and continued to act as the exclusive distributor for small-format and foodservice customers.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, PepsiCo no longer mentioned distributing Naked products and only referenced its ongoing 39% financial stake in TBG without any operational role.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a transition from active operational involvement (distribution) to a passive financial investment with no direct operational role."

      "answer": "In 2022, PepsiCo reported a total notional value of $3.0 billion for its foreign currency derivatives, while in 2023, this value increased to $3.8 billion. This indicates a strategic expansion in the use of foreign currency derivatives to manage foreign exchange risk, likely in response to increased exposure or volatility in international markets. Additionally, the company emphasized the use of these derivatives to offset changes in the underlying hedged items, resulting in no material net impact on earnings in 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, the notional value of foreign currency derivatives was $3.0 billion, reflecting the company's risk management approach at that time.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the notional value of these derivatives increased to $3.8 billion, showing a significant increase in the scale of hedging activity.",
        "Step 3: The increase in derivative use suggests a more aggressive or expanded foreign exchange risk management strategy, possibly to counter greater exposure or market volatility."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\ncomprehensive loss and reclassified to our income statement when the hedged transaction affects earnings. If it becomes probable that the hedged transaction will not occur, we immediately recognize the related hedging gains or losses in earnings; such gains or losses reclassified during the year ended December 25, 2021 were not material.\n\nCash flows from derivatives  used  to  manage  commodity  price,  foreign  exchange  or  interest  rate  risks  are classified  as  operating  activities  in  the  cash  flow  statement.  We  classify  both  the  earnings  and  cash  flow impact from these derivatives consistent with the underlying hedged item.\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nWe perform assessments of our counterparty credit risk regularly, including reviewing netting agreements, if any,  and  a  review  of  credit  ratings,  credit  default  swap  rates  and  potential  nonperformance  of  the counterparty. Based on our most recent assessment of our counterparty credit risk, we consider this risk to be low. In addition, we enter into derivative contracts with a variety of financial institutions that we believe are creditworthy in order to reduce our concentration of credit risk.\n\nCertain of our agreements with our counterparties require us to post full collateral on derivative instruments in  a  net  liability  position  if  our  credit  rating  is  at A2  (Moody's  Investors  Service,  Inc.)  or A  (S&amp;P  Global Ratings) and we have been placed on credit watch for possible downgrade or if our credit rating falls below either of these levels. The fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of December 25, 2021 was $247 million. We have posted no collateral under these contracts and no credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered as of December 25, 2021.\n\n## Commodity Prices\n\nWe are subject to commodity price risk because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited in the competitive environment in which we operate. This risk is managed through the use of fixed-price  contracts  and  purchase  orders,  pricing  agreements  and  derivative  instruments,  which  primarily include  swaps  and  futures.  In  addition,  risk  to  our  supply  of  certain  raw  materials  is  mitigated  through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. We use derivatives, with terms of no more than three years, to hedge price fluctuations related to a portion of our anticipated commodity purchases, primarily for agricultural products, energy and metals. Derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in  corporate  unallocated  expenses  as  either  cost  of  sales  or  selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.\n\nOur  commodity  derivatives  had  a  total  notional  value  of  $1.6  billion  as  of  December  25,  2021  and  $1.1 billion as of December 26, 2020.\n\n## Foreign Exchange\n\nWe  are  exposed  to  foreign  exchange  risks  in  the  international  markets  in  which  our  products  are  made, manufactured,  distributed  or  sold.  Additionally,  we  are  exposed  to  foreign  exchange  risk  from  net investments  in  foreign  subsidiaries,  foreign  currency  purchases  and  foreign  currency  assets  and  liabilities created  in  the  normal  course  of  business.  We  manage  this  risk  through  sourcing  purchases  from  local suppliers, negotiating contracts in local currencies with foreign suppliers and through the use of derivatives, primarily forward contracts with terms of no more than two years. Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign  currency  transactions  are  recognized  as  transaction  gains  or  losses  on  our  income  statement  as incurred.  We  also  use  net  investment  hedges  to  partially  offset  the  effects  of  foreign  currency  on  our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the accounting estimates for pension and retiree medical plans were influenced by uncertainties related to the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. By 2023, this had evolved, and the estimates were instead influenced by business and economic uncertainty stemming from the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, as well as a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment. This indicates a shift in the external risk factors affecting the company's pension and retiree medical plans from health-related disruptions to broader macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns.",

      "question": "How did PepsiCo's presentation of the 4.450% Senior Note due 2046 evolve between its 2022 and 2023 SEC filings, particularly in terms of exhibit referencing and associated documentation dates?",
      "answer": "In the 2022 filing, the 4.450% Senior Note due 2046 was listed as Exhibit 4.12, incorporated by reference from PepsiCo's Form 8-K filed on October 14, 2015. In the 2023 filing, the same note was reclassified as Exhibit 4.13 and referenced the Form 8-K filed on February 24, 2016. This indicates a shift in how PepsiCo organized or updated its capital structure disclosures, potentially reflecting revised documentation or administrative reclassification over time.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, the 4.450% Senior Note due 2046 was listed as Exhibit 4.12, referencing a filing date of October 14, 2015.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the same note was renumbered as Exhibit 4.13 and associated with a new filing date of February 24, 2016.",
        "Step 3: The change in exhibit number and reference date suggests an evolution in PepsiCo\u2019s disclosure framework, possibly indicating updated documentation or a reorganization of exhibits."

      "question": "How has Costco's use of variable-priced contracts for energy purchases evolved between 2022 and 2023, and what does this indicate about its commodity price risk management strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Costco entered into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of electricity and natural gas, as well as fuel for its gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts met the definition of derivatives but generally qualified for the 'normal purchases and normal sales' exception, requiring no mark-to-market adjustment. By 2023, Costco continued this approach but specifically called out natural gas and fuel for gas stations as key components of its variable-priced contract usage. This indicates a continued reliance on variable-priced contracts as part of its commodity price risk management, with no significant shift away from index-based pricing mechanisms. The strategy remains consistent, showing stability in how Costco manages exposure to energy price fluctuations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2022, Costco used variable-priced contracts for electricity, natural gas, and gas station fuel, tied to index pricing, and applied the 'normal purchases and normal sales' exception.",
        "In 2023, the company reaffirmed its use of variable-priced contracts, specifically emphasizing natural gas and gas station fuel, with the same accounting treatment.",
        "The consistent use of these contracts across both years shows a stable approach to managing commodity price risk, with no indication of a strategic shift."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOur policy limits investments in the U.S. to direct U.S. government and government agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government and government agency obligations, U.S. government and government agency money market funds, and insured bank balances. Our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. government and government agency obligations and U.S. government and government agency money market funds. Our Canadian and Other International subsidiaries' investments are primarily in money market funds, bankers' acceptances, and bank certificates of deposit, generally denominated in local currencies.\n\nA 100 basis point change in interest rates as of the end of 2022 would have had an immaterial incremental change in fair market value. For those investments that are classified as available-for-sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to  fluctuations  in  market  volatility  and  interest  rates  are  reflected  within  stockholders'  equity  in  accumulated  other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe nature and amount of our long-term debt may vary as a result of business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. As of the end of 2022, long-term debt with fixed interest rates was $6,590. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed-rate debt. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long-term debt.\n\n## Foreign Currency Risk\n\nOur foreign subsidiaries conduct certain transactions in non-functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of these fluctuations on known future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency.  The  contracts  are  intended  primarily  to  economically  hedge  exposure  to  U.S.  dollar  merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. For additional information related to the Company's forward foreign-exchange  contracts,  see  Notes  1  and  3  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in  Item  8  of  this Report. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non-functional currency exchange rates at August 28, 2022, would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $128 and resulted in an unrealized loss in the consolidated statements of income for the same amount.\n\n## Commodity Price Risk\n\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy, particularly electricity and natural gas, and other commodities used in retail and manufacturing operations, which we seek to partially mitigate through fixed-price contracts for certain of our warehouses and other facilities, predominantly in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of electricity and natural gas, in addition to some of the fuel for our gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the 'normal purchases and normal sales' exception under authoritative guidance and require no mark-to-market adjustment.",

      "question": "How did Costco's strategy regarding the penetration of private-label items evolve between 2022 and 2023 in response to cost and pricing pressures?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Costco responded to higher-than-recent inflation in merchandise costs by employing several strategies, including absorbing some cost increases internally, purchasing earlier and in larger volumes, and selectively passing on cost increases to members, all of which were aimed at maintaining pricing authority while managing gross margin pressures. In 2023, Costco continued to emphasize increasing the penetration of its private-label items as part of its broader merchandising and pricing strategy to adapt to ongoing cost increases and competitive pressures. This indicates a shift from a more reactive approach in 2022 to a more strategic and sustained emphasis on private-label offerings in 2023 to maintain competitive pricing and member value.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Costco faced inflationary pressures and responded by absorbing some cost increases, purchasing earlier and in greater volumes, and selectively passing costs to members, as noted in the MD&A section.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the company explicitly highlighted increasing the penetration of private-label items as a key merchandising strategy to manage cost and pricing pressures.",
        "Step 3: The evolution shows a shift from tactical responses in 2022 to a more strategic focus on private-label items in 2023 to maintain pricing authority and profitability."

MD&amp;A  is  provided  as  a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes  to  Financial  Statements  (Part  II,  Item  8  of  this  Form  10-K).  This  section  generally  discusses  the  results  of operations for  2022  compared to 2021. For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition  for  2021  compared  to  2020  refer  to  Part  II,  Item  7,  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial Condition  and  Results  of  Operations  in  our  fiscal  year  2021  Form  10-K,  which  was  filed  with  the  United  States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on October 6, 2021.\n\n## Overview\n\nWe believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales. Net sales includes our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary (gasoline,  pharmacy,  optical,  food  court,  hearing  aids,  and  tire  installation)  and  other  businesses  (e-commerce, business centers, travel and other). We define comparable sales as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members  and  the  amount  they  spend  on  each  visit  (average  ticket).  Sales  comparisons  can  also  be  particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to our international  operations);  inflation  and  changes  in  the  cost  of  gasoline  and  associated  competitive  conditions.  The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage our SG&amp;A expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term. Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and gross margins  are  also  impacted  by  our  competition,  which  is  vigorous  and  widespread,  across  a  wide  range  of  global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or  reliably  predict  general  economic  health  or  changes  in  competition,  we  believe  that  we  have  been  successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items, and through online offerings.\n\nOur philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short-term  on  maximizing  prices  charged,  but  instead  seek  to  maintain  what  we  believe  is  a  perception  among  our members of our 'pricing authority' - consistently providing the most competitive values. Merchandise costs in 2022 were impacted by inflation higher than what we have experienced in recent years. The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases. Those strategies can include, but are not limited to, working with our suppliers to share in absorbing cost increases, earlierthan-usual purchasing and in greater volumes, offering seasonal merchandise outside its season, as well as passing cost  increases  on  to  our  members.  Our  investments  in  merchandise  pricing  may  include  reducing  prices  on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin and gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage).\n\nWe  believe  our  gasoline  business  enhances  traffic  in  our  warehouses,  but  it  generally  has  a  lower  gross  margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline business. It also has lower SG&amp;A expenses as a percent of net sales compared to our non-gasoline business. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-",

      "answer": "In 2022, the membership format was described as 'an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability,' with an emphasis on growth in the membership base, increasing Executive member penetration, and sustaining high renewal rates as key drivers of profitability. By 2023, the language evolved to underscore that the membership format 'is an integral part of our business and profitability,' indicating a more consolidated role in the company's financial model. Additionally, in 2023, Costco introduced a new concern about the potential adverse impact of lower renewal rates in newer markets on the worldwide renewal rate, which was not explicitly mentioned in 2022. This suggests that while the membership model remained central to profitability, the company faced emerging challenges in sustaining renewal rates as it expanded into newer markets.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nterm net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&amp;A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China and the United  States,  have  affected  the  costs  of  some  of  our  merchandise.  The  degree  of  our  exposure  is  dependent  on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. Higher tariffs could adversely impact our results.\n\nWe also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses  and  cannibalization  of  sales  at  existing  warehouses  when  openings  occur  in  existing  markets,  are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower  gross  margin  percentage  relative  to  our  warehouse  operations.  E-commerce  sales  growth  slowed  in  2022 compared to 2021 and 2020.\n\nThe membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets.\n\nOur financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this  area,  some  significant  costs  are  partially  outside  our  control,  particularly  health  care  and  utility  expenses.  With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction  requires  maintaining  compensation  levels  that  are  better  than  the  industry  average  for  much  of  our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements  of  income,  particularly  merchandise  costs  and  SG&amp;A  expenses,  can  have  substantial  impacts  on  net income.\n\nOur operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canadian, and Other International operating segments (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report). Certain operations in the Other International  segment  have  relatively  higher  rates  of  square  footage  growth,  lower  wage  and  benefit  costs  as  a percentage of sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, or lack e-commerce or business delivery.\n\nIn discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period's currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period.\n\nOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to 2022, 2021, and 2020 relate to the 52-week fiscal  years  ended  August  28,  2022,  August  29,  2021,  and  August  30,  2020,  respectively.  Certain  percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco.",

      "question": "How has the positioning and associated risk profile of Costco's Kirkland Signature brand evolved between 2022 and 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Costco emphasized the Kirkland Signature brand as a strategic asset, highlighting its high quality, competitive pricing, and contribution to higher margins. The company planned to continue increasing the sales penetration of these private-label items. However, by 2023, the risk disclosures included broader mentions of how supply chain disruptions, foreign exchange fluctuations, and catastrophic events could negatively impact the business\u2014including private-label brands like Kirkland Signature. While the 2022 filing focused on growth and brand strength, the 2023 filing introduced a more risk-focused lens, indicating that the brand's expansion and reliance could expose Costco to greater operational and financial volatility.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2022, Costco explicitly described Kirkland Signature as a high-quality, margin-enhancing private-label brand and stated an intent to increase its sales penetration.",
        "In 2023, while not naming Kirkland Signature directly, the filing outlined new or emphasized risks\u2014such as foreign exchange volatility and supply chain disruptions\u2014that could adversely affect merchandise costs and operations, including for private-label products.",
        "The evolution reflects a shift from a growth-oriented narrative around Kirkland Signature in 2022 to a more risk-aware posture in 2023, suggesting that the brand's increased importance may also heighten exposure to external business risks."

We compete on a worldwide basis with global, national, and regional  wholesalers  and  retailers,  including  supermarkets,  supercenters,  internet  retailers,  gasoline  stations,  hard discounters, department and specialty stores, and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise. Walmart, Target, Kroger, and Amazon are among our significant general merchandise retail competitors in the U.S. We also compete with other warehouse clubs, including Walmart's Sam's Club and BJ's Wholesale Club. Many of the major metropolitan areas in the U.S. and certain of our Other International locations have multiple competing clubs.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nWe believe that, to varying degrees, our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, proprietary processes, trade secrets, trade dress, domain names and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important to our success. We have invested significantly in the development and protection of our well-recognized brands, including the Costco Wholesale trademarks and our private-label brand, Kirkland Signature. We believe that Kirkland Signature products  are  high  quality,  offered  at  prices  that  are  generally  lower  than  national  brands,  and  help  lower  costs, differentiate our merchandise offerings, and generally earn higher margins. We expect to continue to increase the sales penetration of our private-label items.\n\nWe rely on trademark and copyright laws, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality, license and other agreements with our suppliers, employees and others to protect our intellectual property. The availability and duration of trademark registrations vary by country; however, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and registrations are maintained.\n\n## Available Information\n\nOur U.S. website is www.costco.com.

      "answer": "In 2023, the 2.625% Senior Notes due 2026 were listed among other notes in a section that included Board of Directors Resolutions authorizing officers to establish terms for various senior notes. By 2024, PepsiCo not only retained the 2.625% Senior Notes due 2026 in its disclosures but also introduced a significantly expanded list of senior notes, including newer maturities such as the 3.000% Senior Notes due 2027 and the 2.625% Senior Notes due 2029. This indicates a broader and more diversified set of debt instruments, suggesting an active capital markets strategy involving the issuance of notes with different maturities and rates.",

        "In 2023, the 2.625% Senior Notes due 2026 were listed among other notes in a section describing Board-authorized terms for various senior notes.",
        "In 2024, the 2.625% Senior Notes due 2026 remained listed, but PepsiCo introduced new notes such as the 3.000% Senior Notes due 2027 and the 2.625% Senior Notes due 2029.",
        "The evolution reflects a strategic expansion in PepsiCo's debt portfolio, maintaining existing instruments while introducing new ones to manage financing needs over different time horizons."

      "answer": "In 2023, the 4.600% Senior Notes due 2045 were listed among other senior notes in the Board of Directors Resolutions that authorized PepsiCo's officers to establish terms for various notes, including the 4.600% Senior Notes due 2045. By 2024, the 4.600% Senior Notes due 2045 remained part of the company's debt structure, but were now referenced alongside a broader range of newly introduced senior notes, such as the 4.000% Senior Notes due 2047 and Floating Rate Notes due 2026. This indicates that while the 4.600% Senior Notes due 2045 remained a part of PepsiCo's long-term debt strategy, the company expanded its debt portfolio with additional instruments, suggesting a more diversified approach to long-term financing in 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, the 4.600% Senior Notes due 2045 were among several senior notes listed in the Board of Directors Resolutions, indicating the company's existing long-term debt commitments.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the 4.600% Senior Notes due 2045 were still present in the list of authorized notes, but the company introduced a wider variety of new senior notes with different maturity dates and interest rates, such as the 4.000% Senior Notes due 2047 and Floating Rate Notes due 2026.",
        "Step 3: The continued presence of the 4.600% Senior Notes due 2045 in 2024, alongside the addition of new notes, indicates that PepsiCo maintained its long-term commitment to this instrument while also diversifying its debt structure to include more flexible or varied maturity and rate profiles."

      "question": "How did PepsiCo's engagement with the 3.500% Senior Notes due 2025 evolve between 2023 and 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's debt management strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2023, PepsiCo's 3.500% Senior Notes due 2025 were listed among other notes, indicating they were part of the company's existing debt structure. By 2024, the 3.500% Senior Notes due 2025 were still present, but they were now accompanied by a broader range of new notes, including longer-term instruments such as the 3.500% Senior Notes due 2040 and the 3.550% Senior Notes due 2034. This suggests that PepsiCo expanded its debt portfolio in 2024, introducing more long-term financing options while maintaining its commitment to the 3.500% Senior Notes due 2025. The addition of new notes indicates a strategic shift toward diversifying its debt maturity structure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, the 3.500% Senior Notes due 2025 were listed among other notes, including the 3.600% Senior Notes due 2024, the 2.750% Senior Notes due 2025, and the 4.250% Senior Notes due 2044, indicating they were part of an existing debt structure.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the 3.500% Senior Notes due 2025 remained, but the debt portfolio expanded to include new notes such as the 3.500% Senior Notes due 2040 and the 3.550% Senior Notes due 2034, suggesting a broader financing strategy.",
        "Step 3: The continued presence of the 3.500% Senior Notes due 2025 alongside new long-term notes indicates a strategic evolution toward diversifying PepsiCo's debt maturity structure, maintaining short-term obligations while introducing more long-term financing."

      "answer": "In 2023, PepsiCo referenced the 2.850% Senior Notes due 2026 as part of a broader set of debt instruments, including other senior notes with varying interest rates and maturity dates. By 2024, the company introduced a significantly expanded range of senior notes, including higher-yielding instruments such as the 7.00% Senior Notes due 2029 and the 5.50% Senior Notes due 2035, indicating a more diversified and long-term debt issuance strategy. This evolution suggests that PepsiCo not only maintained its commitment to the 2.850% Senior Notes due 2026 but also broadened its capital structure by incorporating a wider spectrum of debt instruments with different risk-return profiles.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, PepsiCo referenced the 2.850% Senior Notes due 2026 among other notes such as the 3.600% Senior Notes due 2024, the 2.625% Senior Notes due 2026, and the 4.250% Senior Notes due 2044, showing a balanced approach to short-, medium-, and long-term debt.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, PepsiCo introduced a significantly expanded list of senior notes, including high-yield notes like the 7.00% Senior Notes due 2029 and the 5.50% Senior Notes due 2035, indicating a shift toward a more aggressive and diversified debt issuance strategy.",
        "Step 3: The continued presence of the 2.850% Senior Notes due 2026 in 2024, alongside the introduction of new, higher-yielding instruments, indicates that PepsiCo's engagement with this specific note remained consistent while its overall debt strategy evolved to include a broader and more varied set of instruments."

      "answer": "In the 2022 10-K filing, Bounty was mentioned as part of P&G's Family Care business within the Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment, but it was not explicitly listed among the key brands. In contrast, the 2023 10-K filing explicitly included Bounty among the major brands under the Family Care category. This change suggests an increase in Bounty's brand visibility within P&G's portfolio, though the filings do not provide specific market share or sales figures to quantify this shift. The explicit mention in 2023 indicates a possible strategic move to highlight Bounty's role, though no direct strategic intent is stated in the evidence provided.",

        "In 2022, Bounty was referenced as part of the Family Care business but was not named among the key brands in the segment.",

      "answer": "In the 2022 filing, Always Discreet was explicitly stated to have over 10% market share in the key adult incontinence markets where Procter & Gamble competes. However, in the 2023 filing, while Always Discreet is still listed as a major brand in the Feminine Care category under the Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment, no specific market share figure is provided for the brand. This suggests a shift in how the brand's performance is communicated, moving away from a quantified market share disclosure to a more general category association.",

        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 - In 2022, Always Discreet is reported to have over 10% market share in the adult incontinence category, indicating a clear quantitative performance metric.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 - In 2023, Always Discreet is listed among the major brands in the Feminine Care category, but no market share figure is provided, suggesting a change in reporting emphasis.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The change is a transformation in how Always Discreet is positioned in the reporting: from a specific market share metric in 2022 to a more general categorical placement in 2023, which may reflect strategic or performance-related shifts."

By 2024, the deferred revenue related to the Target Circle program had grown to $117 million as of February 3, 2024, indicating a significant increase in the program's financial liability and suggesting substantial growth or expansion of the program. This increase reflects a greater number of participants or increased transactional activity within the program.",

      "answer": "In 2023, the company's Japanese subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes totaling approximately $500 at fixed interest rates ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. These notes were valued using Level 3 inputs. In 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of these Guaranteed Senior Notes. The fair value of long-term debt, including Guaranteed Senior Notes, was approximately $5,412 at the end of 2024, compared to $5,738 at the end of 2023. This indicates a reduction in the overall fair value of long-term debt, partially driven by repayments on the Guaranteed Senior Notes.",

Cash flow used in financing activ ities primarily related to the payment of div idends, repayments of long-term debt and short-term borrowings, repurchases of common stock, and withholding taxes on stock-based awards. On May 18, 2024, we paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance on the 2.750% Senior Notes, using cash and cash equiv alents and shortterm inv estments. Cash flow prov ided by financing activ ities included proceeds from short-term borrowings and four Guaranteed Senior Notes totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%, issued by our Japan subsidiary.\n\n## Dividends\n\nCash dividends declared in 2024 totaled $8,589 or $19.36 per share, as compared to $1,703 or $3.84 per share in 2023.

In April 2024, the Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash div idend from $1.02 to $1.16 per share.\n\n## Share Repurchase Program\n\nOn January 19, 2023, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program in the amount of $4,000, which expires in January 2027. During 2024 and 2023, we repurchased 1,004,000 and 1,341,000 shares of common stock, at an average price per share of $695.29 and $504.68, totaling approximately $698 and $677. These amounts may differ from the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled repurchases at the end of each fiscal year. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases, pursuant  to  plans  under  SEC  Rule  10b5-1.  Repurchased  shares  are  retired,  in  accordance  with  the  Washington  Business  Corporation  Act.

We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believ e  to  be  reasonable,  and  we  continue  to  rev iew  and  ev aluate  these  estimates.  For  further  information  on  significant  accounting  policies,  see discussion in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\n\n## Insurance/Self-insurance Liabilities\n\nClaims for  employee  health-care  benefits,  workers'  compensation,  general  liability,  property  damage,  directors'  and  officers'  liability,  v ehicle  liability, inv entory  loss,  and  other  exposures  are  funded  predominantly  through  self-insurance.  Insurance  cov erage  is  maintained  for  certain  risks  to  limit exposures to v ery large losses. We use v arious risk management mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captiv e insurance subsidiary, and participate in a  reinsurance  program.  Liabilities  associated  with  the  risks  that  we  retain  are  not  discounted  and  are  estimated  using  historical  claims  experience, demographic factors, sev erity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The costs of claims are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate as a result of inflation rates, regulatory or legal changes, and unforeseen dev elopments in claims. While we believ e our estimates are reasonable, actual claims and costs could differ significantly from recorded liabilities. Historically, adjustments to our estimates hav e been immaterial.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nSee discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\n\n## Item 7A-Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (amounts in millions)\n\nOur exposure to financial market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculativ e or lev eraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our inv estment holdings that are div ersified among v arious instruments considered to be cash equiv alents, as defined in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report, as well as short-term inv estments in gov ernment and agency securities with effectiv e maturities of generally three months to fiv e years at the date of purchase. T he primary objectiv e of our inv estment activ ities is to preserv e principal and secondarily to generate yields. T he majority of our short-term inv estments are in fixed interest-rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair v alue due to interest rate fluctuations.\n\nOur policy limits inv estments in the U.S. to direct U.S. gov ernment and gov ernment agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government and government agency obligations, U.S. gov ernment and gov ernment agency money market funds, and insured bank balances. Our whollyowned captiv e insurance subsidiary inv ests in U.S. gov ernment and gov ernment agency obligations and U.S. gov ernment and gov ernment agency money market funds. Our Canadian and Other International subsidiaries' inv estments are primarily in money market funds, bankers' acceptances, and bank certificates of deposit, generally denominated in local currencies.\n\nA 100 basis point change in interest rates as of the end of 2024 would hav e had an immaterial incremental change in fair market v alue.  For those inv estments  that  are  classified  as  av ailable-for-sale,  the  unrealized  gains  or  losses  related  to  fluctuations  in  market  v olatility  and  interest  rates  are reflected",

      "question": "How has the treatment and recognition of shop card liabilities evolved between 2023 and 2024, and what does this indicate about Costco's approach to unclaimed balances?",
      "answer": "In both 2023 and 2024, Costco recognized revenue from shop cards upon redemption and accounted for outstanding balances as a liability, net of estimated breakage based on redemption data. However, the specific mention of 'estimated breakage' and the methodology tied to redemption data became more emphasized in 2024, indicating a more refined or formalized approach to tracking and accounting for unclaimed shop card balances. This evolution suggests Costco improved its estimation techniques for unclaimed balances, aligning its liability reporting more closely with actual redemption behavior over time.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, Costco disclosed that shop card revenue is recognized upon redemption and that outstanding balances are treated as a liability, net of estimated breakage based on redemption data.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the disclosure remained consistent in recognizing revenue upon redemption, but there was a more explicit emphasis on the use of redemption data to estimate breakage, indicating a more mature or detailed analytical approach.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects an evolution in how Costco manages and accounts for unclaimed shop card balances, moving toward a more data-driven estimation model."

These items were $64, $46 and $84 in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company recognizes sales for the amount of consideration collected from the member, which includes gross shipping fees where applicable, and is net of sales taxes collected and remitted to gov ernment agencies and member returns. The Company reserv es for estimated returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns and reduces sales and merchandise costs accordingly. The Company records, on a gross basis, a refund liability and an asset for recov ery, which are included in other current liabilities and other current assets, respectiv ely, in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe  Company offers merchandise in the following core merchandise categories: foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods.  The  Company also prov ides  expanded  products  and  serv ices  through  warehouse  ancillary  and  other  businesses.  T he  Company  is  the  principal  for  the  majority  of  its transactions and recognizes rev enue on a gross basis.  The  Company is the principal when it has control of the merchandise or serv ice before it is transferred to the member. The majority of rev enue from merchandise sales is recognized at the point of sale. Rev enue generated through e-commerce or special orders is generally recognized upon shipment to the member. For merchandise shipped directly to the member, shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred as fulfillment costs and included in merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income. In certain ancillary businesses, rev enue is deferred until the member picks up merchandise at the warehouse. Deferred sales are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe  Company  accounts  for  membership  fee  rev enue,  net  of  refunds,  on  a  deferred  basis,  ratably  ov er  the  one-year  membership  period.  Deferred membership fees at the end of 2024 and 2023 were $2,501 and $2,337.\n\nIn most countries, the Company's Executiv e members qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases, subject to an annual maximum v alue, which does not expire and is redeemable at Costco warehouses. The Company accounts for this reward as a reduction in sales, net of the estimated impact of nonredemptions (breakage), with the corresponding liability classified as accrued member rewards in the consolidated balance sheets. Estimated breakage is computed based on redemption data. For 2024, 2023, and 2022, the net reduction in sales was $2,804, $2,576, and $2,307.\n\nThe Company sells and otherwise prov ides proprietary shop cards that do not expire and are redeemable at the warehouse or online for merchandise or membership. Revenue from shop cards is recognized upon redemption, and estimated breakage is recognized based on redemption data. The Company accounts for  outstanding  shop  card  balances  as  a  shop  card  liability,  net  of  estimated  breakage.  Shop  card  liabilities  are  included  in  other  current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nCitibank, N.A. is the exclusiv e issuer of co-branded credit cards to U.S. members. The Company receiv es v arious forms of consideration from Citibank, including a royalty on purchases made on the card outside of Costco. A portion of the royalty is used to fund the rebate that cardholders receiv e, after taking into consideration breakage, which is calculated based on rebate redemption data. The rebates are issued in February and expire on December 31. The Company also maintains co-branded credit card arrangements in Canada and certain other International subsidiaries.\n\n## Merchandise Costs\n\nMerchandise costs consist of the purchase price or manufacturing costs of inv entory sold, inbound and outbound shipping charges and all costs related to the Company's depot, fulfillment and manufacturing operations, and are reduced by v endor consideration. Merchandise costs also include salaries, benefits, depreciation, and utilities in fresh foods departments and certain ancillary businesses.",

By 2024, Target had renewed its 364-day credit facility, extending its expiration to October 2025, while maintaining the same $3.0 billion five-year facility. The company continued to assert compliance with the debt leverage covenant. The renewal of the 364-day facility likely provided continued flexibility, supporting Target\u2019s ability to remain compliant with the covenant.",

        "Step 3: The evolution shows that Target maintained compliance with the debt leverage covenant despite the transition of its 364-day credit facility, suggesting that the renewal supported continued adherence to the covenant."

Each of the credit rating agencies rev iews its rating periodically, and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same as described abov e.\n\nWe have the ability to obtain short-term financing from time to time under our commercial paper program and credit facilities. In October 2024, we obtained a new committed $1.0 billion 364-day unsecured rev olv ing credit facility that will expire in October 2025 and terminated our prior 364-day credit facility. T his credit facility and our $3.0 billion unsecured rev olv ing credit facility that will expire in October 2028 prov ide a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. No balances were outstanding under either credit facility at any time during 2024 or 2023. We did not hav e any balances outstanding under our commercial paper program as of February 1, 2025 or February 3, 2024.\n\nMost of our long-term debt obligations contain cov enants related to secured debt lev els.

Such obligations include, but are not limited  to,  purchase commitments, debt serv ice, leasing arrangements, and liabilities related to deferred compensation and pensions.  The Notes  to  the Consolidated Financial Statements prov ide additional information.\n\nWe believe our sources of liquidity, namely operating cash flows, credit facility capacity, and access to capital markets, will continue to be adequate to meet our contractual obligations, working capital and capital expenditure requirements, finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiativ es, fund debt maturities, pay div idends, and execute purchases under our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and apply judgments that affect the reported  amounts.  In  the Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  we  describe  the  significant  accounting  policies  used  in  preparing  the consolidated financial statements.

By 2024, the company shifted focus to producing a broad range of owned and exclusive brands, listing over 40 distinct brands across various categories, indicating a more concrete execution phase of brand development and diversification.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, the company explicitly stated its intent to 'expand the breadth and depth of signature partnerships' and strengthen its owned brands portfolio as part of its broader strategy.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, Target provided a detailed list of over 40 owned and exclusive brands, including brand names like 'Good & Gather\u2122', 'Project 62\u2122', and 'Sonia Kashuk\u2122', showing a shift from strategic intent to tangible product portfolio development.",
        "Step 3: The evolution from strategic expansion (2023) to concrete brand production and listing (2024) reflects a transformation in how Target approached its owned brands \u2014 moving from planning and positioning to execution and diversification."

We use a combination of industry-leading tools and in-house technologies to protect T arget and our guests, operate a proactiv e threat intelligence program to identify and assess risks, including from threats associated with our use of third-party serv ice prov iders, and we run a cyber fusion center to inv estigate and respond to threats. Our program is based on recognized industry security standards and control frameworks, which we seek to v alidate through internal and independent assessments. Our cybersecurity team regularly tests our controls through penetration testing, v ulnerability scanning, and attack simulation. In addition, we hav e an incident response program to address potential security and  priv acy  incidents.  As  part  of  this  incident  response  program,  members  of  management  are  informed  about  and  monitor  the  prev ention, detection,  mitigation,  and  remediation  of  potential  security  and  priv acy  incidents.  T he  program  uses  a  coordinated  escalation  model  to  prov ide information  to,  and  engage  with,  relev ant  members  of  management  and  the  Board  of  Directors,  as  needed,  throughout  the  incident  response process.\n- Understanding evolving threats in the industry and with our suppliers. Our cybersecurity and data priv acy teams work to understand ev olv ing threats, dev eloping issues, and industry trends, and our v endor teams monitor and assess risks with our suppliers.\n- Collaboration with organizations across different industries. We share threat intelligence and collaborate with organizations across different industries  to  share  best  practices,  fight  cybercrime,  enhance  priv acy,  discuss  new  technologies,  better  understand  the  ev olv ing  regulatory environment, and adv ance capabilities in these areas.\n- Investment, training, and development of our cybersecurity and data privacy teams. We invest in building and dev eloping cybersecurity talent and engineering expertise in-house rather than relying solely on third-party prov iders. We also offer in-house training and educational courses through our Cyber Plus Institute, which is a security training curriculum lev eraging internal subject matter expertise along with curated resources. Our  data  priv acy  team  has  industry  certifications,  works  to  understand  changing  technologies  that  impact  consumer  priv acy,  and  regularly participates in training and conferences.\n- Regular  training  and  compliance  activities  for  our  team  members. Our  team  members  receiv e  annual  training  on  information  security, cybersecurity,  and  data  priv acy  topics  to  understand  the  behav iors  and  technical  requirements  necessary  to  protect  company  and  guest information, and appropriately collect, use, and share personal information.  We also offer ongoing practice and education for team members to recognize and report suspicious activ ity.\n- Use of third parties. Beyond our in-house capabilities we engage with leading security and technology v endors to assess our information security and cybersecurity program and test our technical capabilities.\n- Insurance coverage. We maintain insurance cov erage intended to limit our exposure to certain network security and priv acy matters.\n\nSee  'Information  Security,  Cybersecurity,  and  Data  Priv acy  Risks'  in  Part  I,  Item  1A,  Risk  Factors  for  additional  information  regarding  risks  from cybersecurity threats.\n\n2024 Form 10-K",

      "answer": "In 2023, Target specifically highlighted California ports as a key area affected by port security issues, mentioning that these ports were where the company received a significant portion of its imported merchandise. By 2024, Target broadened its focus, referring to 'major U.S. ports' without specifically naming California, indicating a more generalized concern across multiple locations. Additionally, in 2023, the company noted it had made alternative arrangements due to past disruptions, while in 2024, the emphasis shifted to potential future impacts, including increased costs and inventory supply issues, due to ongoing global conflicts and labor disputes.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, Target identified California ports as a specific risk point related to port security, noting that these ports were critical for receiving imported merchandise and had experienced disruptions.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, Target generalized the risk to 'major U.S. ports' rather than naming California specifically, and added new concerns about global conflicts and labor disputes affecting port operations.",
        "Step 3: The change indicates a shift from a localized risk (California ports) to a broader, more systemic supply chain vulnerability involving multiple U.S. ports and international factors, with an increased emphasis on potential future cost and inventory impacts."

          "chunk_text": "## Supply Chain and Third-Party Risks\n\nChanges in our relationships with our vendors or other companies, changes in tax or trade policy, interruptions in our operations or supply chain, and increased commodity or supply chain costs could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.\n\nWe are dependent on our vendors, independent contractors, and other third parties (including common carriers) to supply merchandise to our distribution centers, stores, and guests. If our replenishment and fulfillment network does not operate properly, if we are unable to timely import certain merchandise, if a v endor fails to deliv er on its commitments, or if common carriers hav e difficulty prov iding capacity to meet demands for their serv ices like they experienced in recent years, we could experience merchandise out-of-stocks, delays in shipping and receiv ing merchandise, and increased costs, which could adv ersely affect our reputation and results of operations. In addition, we hav e consumer-facing relationships with a v ariety of other companies, including Apple, CVS, Disney, Lev i's, Starbucks, and Ulta Beauty. Any termination of, or adv erse change in, our relationship with any of these companies could decrease our sales, increase our costs, and negativ ely impact our reputation and results of operations.\n\nA significant portion of the merchandise that we offer is sourced, directly or indirectly, from outside the U.S., with China as our single largest source of merchandise we import. Any trade disputes or changes in tax or trade policy between the U.S. and countries from which we source merchandise, such as the imposition of additional tariffs or duties on imported products, could require us to take certain actions, including raising prices on products we sell and seeking alternativ e  sources  of  supply  from  v endors  in  other  countries.  In  particular ,  recent  U.S.  tariffs  imposed  or  threatened  to  be  imposed  on  China, Mexico, Canada, and other countries and any retaliatory actions taken by such countries could result in us incurring substantial additional costs to procure a large portion of the merchandise we offer and may require us to raise prices on certain products. In addition, if our competitors do not keep pace with any such price increases or are able to offset the impact of tariffs through other actions, our competitiv e position may be adv ersely affected. Any of these outcomes could adversely affect our reputation, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\nPolitical or economic uncertainty or instability, trade policies, disputes, or sanctions, currency fluctuations, the outbreak of pandemics or other illnesses, labor shortages, labor unrest or strikes, transport capacity and costs, inflation, port security, weather conditions, natural disasters, geopolitical conflicts, social unrest, terrorist attacks, armed conflicts, or other ev ents that hav e affected, and could in the future affect, foreign trade are beyond our control. T hese types of ev ents hav e impacted us, and could impact us in the future, including by disrupting our supply of merchandise, increasing the price and limiting the availability of raw materials, increasing our costs, and adv ersely affecting our results of operations. For example, there hav e been periodic closings and ship div ersions, armed conflicts, unrest, labor disputes, and congestion disrupting railways, trucking, waterways, and ports around the world, including at major U.S. ports where we receiv e a significant portion of the products we source from outside the U.S. We hav e from time to time made alternativ e arrangements to continue the flow of inv entory as a result of supply chain disruptions in the U.S. and other countries. If these types of ev ents recur and impact any of the locations or modes of transportation that we depend on, it could increase our costs and adv ersely affect our supply of inv entory. In addition, prices of fuel and  other  commodities  on  which  our  supply  chain  depends  are  historically  v olatile  and  subject  to  fluctuations  based  on  a  v ariety  of  international  and domestic factors. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices, as hav e occurred in recent years, could further increase our costs and adv ersely affect our results of operations.\n\nIf s ervices  we obtain from third parties are unavailable, fail to meet our standards, or increase in cost, our reputation, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\nWe  rely  on  third  parties  to  support  our  business  operations,  including  portions  of  our  technology  infrastructure,  digital  platforms,  replenishment  and fulfillment operations, store and supply chain infrastructure, deliv ery serv ices (including by independent contractors v ia our Shipt subsidiary), guest contact centers, payment processing, and extensions of credit for our T arget-branded payment card program. If we are unable to contract with third parties hav ing the specialized skills needed to support our operations (including as a result of any labor disputes or labor unav ailability at such third parties), if any thirdparty serv ices are interrupted, or if they fail to meet our performance standards, then our reputation and results of operations could be adv ersely affected.",

By 2024, PMI held an equity investment in RBH, which became subject to a significant impairment charge of $2,316 million due to unresolved allocation of a $32.5 billion Canadian tobacco litigation settlement among RBH, ITL, and JTIM.

          "chunk_text": "## Executive Summary\n\nThe following executive summary provides the business update and significant highlights from the Discussion and Analysis that follows.\n\nImpairment Related to the Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Equity Investment\n\nOn October 17, 2024, the court-appointed mediator and monitor in the CCAA proceedings filed a proposed plan of compromise and arrangement ('Proposed Plan') setting forth, among other things, certain terms of a proposed comprehensive resolution of Canadian tobacco claims and related litigation. Under the resolution contemplated by the Proposed Plan, RBH, Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited (\"ITL\") and JTI Macdonald Corp (\"JTIM\") would pay an aggregate global settlement amount of CAD 32.5 billion (approximately $22.3 billion). A significant determinative factor in the analysis of impairment indicators was the issue of allocation of CAD 32.5 billion aggregate settlement amount among RBH, ITL, and JTIM which remained unresolved at the time of filing. On January 24, 2025, RBH filed an objection to approval of the Proposed Plan with the CCAA court (for further details, see Item 8, Note 18. Contingencies ). Developments, including the positions taken by RBH in this objection and the positions taken by other parties in related filings narrowed the range of possible outcomes with respect to the allocation of the aggregate settlement amount of  CAD 32.5 billion among  RBH,  ITL, and  JTIM, which was determined to be an indicator that  PMI's investment in  RBH may be impaired. Although there remains some uncertainty as to the final terms of the Proposed plan, PMI evaluated its investment in RBH for potential impairment and concluded that the estimated fair value of its investment in RBH was lower than its carrying value. As a result, PMI performed a quantitative valuation of its investment in RBH as of December 31, 2024, and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $2,316 million (representing a diluted EPS charge of $1.49 per share) in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024, as a recognized subsequent event. For further details, see Item 8, Note 6. Related Parties - Equity Investments and Other .\n\n## Consolidated Operating Results\n\n- Net Revenues Net revenues of $37.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, increased by $2.7 billion, or 7.7%, from the comparable 2023 amount. The change in our net revenues from the comparable 2023 amount was driven by the following (variances not to scale):\n\nNet revenues increased by 7.7%. Net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 10.1%, mainly reflecting: a favorable pricing variance, primarily driven by higher combustible tobacco pricing; and favorable volume/mix, driven by higher smoke-free products volume, partly offset by unfavorable cigarette mix, as well as a favorable comparison to 2023 reflecting a charge in the first quarter of 2023 of $80 million following the termination of a distribution arrangement in the Middle East, shown in \"Other.\" The termination of a distribution arrangement in the Middle East is further described in the following \" Diluted Earnings Per Share \" discussion.",

      "question": "How has PM's financial relationship with RBH evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly regarding the consolidation status and valuation considerations of RBH within PM's financial statements?",
      "answer": "In 2022, RBH was deconsolidated from PM's financial statements due to CCAA proceedings initiated in 2019, with its financial results excluded since that time. Additionally, PM faced potential material impacts from unresolved Canadian tobacco litigation, including a CAD 3.1 billion allocation of compensatory damages against RBH. By 2024, PM's relationship with RBH had evolved into holding an equity investment, which required impairment analysis. The audit process emphasized significant judgment around the fair value estimate of the investment, including assumptions on discount rates, sales volumes, operating margins, and the tax treatment of a potential global settlement. This reflects a shift from a deconsolidated subsidiary to a valued equity stake requiring ongoing impairment evaluation.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, RBH was deconsolidated from PM's financial statements due to CCAA proceedings initiated in 2019, with a CAD 3.1 billion liability exposure mentioned.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, PM maintained an equity investment in RBH, which required fair value estimation and impairment testing, involving complex assumptions and audit scrutiny.",
        "Step 3: The change indicates a transformation from a deconsolidated legal liability to a retained financial stake requiring valuation modeling and tax analysis."

At the present time, except as stated otherwise in this Note 17. Contingencies, while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, after assessing the information available to it (i) management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobacco-related cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending tobacco-related cases; and (iii) accordingly, no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases, if any. Legal defense costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nIt is possible that our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. Nevertheless, although litigation is subject to uncertainty, we and each of our subsidiaries named as a defendant believe, and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases, that we have valid defenses to the litigation pending against us, as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts. All such cases are,  and  will  continue  to  be,  vigorously  defended.  However, we and our subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if we believe it is in our best interests to do so.\n\n## CCAA Proceedings and Stay of Tobacco-Related Cases Pending in Canada\n\nAs a result of the Court of Appeal of Quebec's decision in both the L\u00e9tourneau and Blais cases described below, our subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. ('RBH'), and the other defendants, JTI Macdonald Corp., and Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited, sought protection in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act ('CCAA') on March 22, March 8, and March 12, 2019 respectively. CCAA is a Canadian federal law that permits a Canadian business to restructure its affairs while carrying on its business in the ordinary course. The initial CCAA order made by the Ontario Superior Court on March 22, 2019 authorizes RBH to pay all expenses incurred  in  carrying  on  its  business  in  the  ordinary  course  after  the  CCAA  filing,  including  obligations  to  employees,  vendors,  and suppliers.  As  further  described  in  Note  20. Deconsolidation  of  RBH ,  RBH's  financial  results  have  been  deconsolidated  from  our consolidated financial statements since March 22, 2019. As part of the CCAA proceedings, there is currently a comprehensive stay up to and including March 31, 2022 of all tobacco-related litigation pending in Canada against RBH and the other defendants, including PMI and our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria), namely, the smoking and health class actions filed in various Canadian provinces and health care cost recovery actions. These proceedings are presented below under the caption ' Stayed Litigation - Canada .'  Ernst &amp; Young Inc. has been appointed as monitor of RBH in the CCAA proceedings. In accordance with the CCAA process, as the parties work towards a plan of arrangement or compromise in a confidential mediation, it is anticipated that the court will set additional hearings and further extend the stay of proceedings. On April 17, 2019, the Ontario Superior Court ruled that RBH and the other defendants will not be allowed to file an application to the Supreme Court of Canada for leave to appeal the Court of Appeal's decision in the L\u00e9tourneau and the Blais cases so long as the comprehensive stay of all tobacco-related litigation in Canada remains in effect and that the time period to file the application would be extended by the stay period. While RBH believes that the findings of liability and damages in both L\u00e9tourneau and the Blais cases were incorrect, the CCAA proceedings will provide a forum for RBH to seek resolution through a plan of arrangement or compromise of all tobacco-related litigation pending in Canada. It is not possible to predict the resolution of the underlying legal proceedings or the length of the CCAA process.\n\nStayed Litigation - Canada\n\n## Smoking and Health Litigation - Canada\n\nIn the first class action pending in Canada, Conseil Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Sur Le Tabac Et La Sant\u00e9 and Jean-Yves Blais v. Imperial Tobacco Ltd., Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. and JTI-Macdonald Corp., Quebec Superior Court, Canada ,  filed in November 1998, RBH and other Canadian cigarette manufacturers (Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd. and JTI-Macdonald Corp.) are defendants. The plaintiffs, an anti-smoking organization and an individual smoker, sought compensatory and punitive damages for each member of the class who suffers allegedly from certain smoking-related diseases. The class was certified in 2005. The trial court issued its judgment on May 27, 2015. The trial court found RBH and two other Canadian manufacturers liable and found that the class members' compensatory damages totaled approximately CAD 15.5 billion, including pre-judgment interest (approximately $12.1 billion). The trial court awarded compensatory damages on a joint and several liability basis, allocating 20% to our subsidiary (approximately CAD 3.1 billion, including pre-judgment interest (approximately $2.4  billion)).  In  addition,  the  trial  court  awarded  CAD  90,000  (approximately  $70,500)  in  punitive  damages,  allocating  CAD  30,000 (approximately $23,500) to RBH. The trial court estimated the disease class at 99,957 members. RBH appealed to the Court of Appeal of Quebec. In October 2015, the Court of Appeal ordered RBH to furnish security totaling CAD 226 million (approximately $177 million) to cover both the L\u00e9tourneau and Blais cases, which RBH has paid in installments through March 2017. The Court of Appeal ordered Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd. to furnish security totaling CAD 758 million (approximately $594 million) in installments through June 2017. JTI Macdonald Corp. was not required to furnish security in accordance with plaintiffs' motion. The Court of Appeal ordered that the security is payable upon a final judgment of the Court of Appeal affirming the trial court's judgment or upon further order of the Court of Appeal.",

          "chunk_text": "The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impairment of the equity investment in RBH is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the Company's investment in RBH; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management's significant assumptions related to the discount rate, sales volumes and operating margins related to the fair value of the combustible tobacco product business in Canada and the estimate of the allocation amount of the aggregate global settlement amount as well as the deductibility of the settlement amount payment for income tax purposes in Canada; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's equity investment impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the Company's investment in RBH. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management's process for developing the fair value  estimate  of  the  investment  in  RBH;  (ii)  evaluating  the  appropriateness  of  the  discounted  cash  flow  analysis;  (iii)  testing  completeness  and  accuracy  of underlying  data  used  in  the  discounted  cash  flow  analysis;  (iv)  evaluating  the  reasonableness  of  significant  assumptions  used  by  management  related  to  the discount rate, sales volumes and operating margins related to the valuation of the combustible cigarette business and the estimate of the allocation amount of the aggregate  global  settlement  amount;  and  (v)  evaluating  the  deductibility  of  the  settlement  amount  payment  for  income  tax   purposes  in  Canada.  Evaluating management's assumptions related to sales volumes and operating margins related to the valuation of the combustible tobacco product business in Canada and the estimate of the allocation amount of the aggregate global settlement amount involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current economic conditions and recent operating results of RBH; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow analysis; (ii) the reasonableness of the discount rate assumption related to the valuation of the combustible tobacco product business in Canada; and (iii) the deductibility of the settlement amount payment for income tax purposes in Canada.\n\n## /S/ PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS SA\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers SA\n\nLausanne, Switzerland February 6, 2025\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2008.\n\n145",

This amount was paid on January 5th 2022, but the final acquisition price remains subject to certain predetermined adjustments based on the audited financial results of PHILSA and PMSA for fiscal years 2021 and 2022. As a result of this acquisition, PMI now owns 100% of these Turkish subsidiaries.\n\n## Global Collaboration Agreement with KT&amp;G\n\nIn January 2020, PMI announced a global collaboration agreement with the leading tobacco and nicotine company in South Korea, KT&amp;G, to commercialize KT&amp;G's smoke-free products outside of the country. The agreement will run for an initial period of three years. The two companies plan for global collaboration with the intention to actively expand to cover many markets, based on commercial success. The agreement allows PMI to distribute current KT&amp;G smoke-free products, and their evolutions, on an exclusive basis, and does not restrict PMI from distributing its own or third-party products. KT&amp;G's smoke-free product brand portfolio includes heat-not-burn tobacco products (e.g., LIL Mini and LIL Plus ), hybrid technologies that combine heat-not-burn tobacco and e-vapor technologies (e.g., LIL HYBRID ), and evapor products (e.g., LIL Vapor ). PMI will be responsible for the commercialization of smoke-free products supplied under the agreement.\n\nProducts sold under the agreement are subject to careful assessment to ensure they meet the regulatory requirements in the markets where they are launched, as well as our standards of quality and scientific substantiation to confirm the absence of combustion and significant reductions of emissions of harmful chemicals compared to cigarettes. PMI and KT&amp;G will seek any necessary regulatory approvals that may be required on a market-by-market basis. There are no current plans to commercialize KT&amp;G products in the United States.\n\nSince the third quarter of 2020, we have launched commercial initiatives for licensed KT&amp;G products in select markets.\n\n## Equity Investments\n\nWe  discuss  our  equity  investments  in  Item  8,  Note  4.

We do not believe that these sales, which are not subject to Trade Sanctions, and are de minimis in volume and value, present a material risk to our shareholders, our reputation or the value of our shares. We have no employees, operations or assets in Sudan.\n\nWe do not sell products in Iran, North Korea and Syria.

      "question": "How has Philip Morris International's financial relationship with Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. (RBH) evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of its accounting treatment and potential financial exposure?",
      "answer": "In 2022, RBH was deconsolidated from Philip Morris International\u2019s financial statements due to its CCAA restructuring, and its financial results were no longer included in PMI\u2019s consolidated financials. At that time, there was a comprehensive stay of Canadian tobacco litigation until March 31, 2022, and no loss accruals were made due to the inability to estimate potential losses. By 2024, PMI\u2019s relationship with RBH had shifted from deconsolidation to an equity investment model. A proposed settlement of CAD 32.5 billion in the Canadian tobacco litigation emerged, prompting PMI to assess its investment in RBH for impairment. As a result, PMI recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $2,316 million in 2024, reflecting a decline in the estimated fair value of its investment. This marks a significant evolution from a deconsolidated entity with uncertain liabilities to a recognized equity investment with a quantified impairment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, RBH was deconsolidated from PMI's financial statements due to CCAA proceedings, and its litigation liabilities were not accrued due to uncertainty.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, PMI recognized an equity investment in RBH and recorded a $2,316 million impairment charge due to the proposed CAD 32.5 billion settlement framework.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a shift in PMI's financial exposure to RBH from deconsolidation to a quantified impairment on an equity investment basis, indicating a structural and financial relationship transformation."

          "chunk_text": "We  and  our  subsidiaries  record  provisions  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for  pending  litigation  when  we  determine  that  an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. At the present time, except as stated otherwise in this Note 17. Contingencies, while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, after assessing the information available to it (i) management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobacco-related cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending tobacco-related cases; and (iii) accordingly, no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases, if any. Legal defense costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nIt is possible that our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. Nevertheless, although litigation is subject to uncertainty, we and each of our subsidiaries named as a defendant believe, and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases, that we have valid defenses to the litigation pending against us, as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts. All such cases are,  and  will  continue  to  be,  vigorously  defended.  However, we and our subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if we believe it is in our best interests to do so.\n\n## CCAA Proceedings and Stay of Tobacco-Related Cases Pending in Canada\n\nAs a result of the Court of Appeal of Quebec's decision in both the L\u00e9tourneau and Blais cases described below, our subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. ('RBH'), and the other defendants, JTI Macdonald Corp., and Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited, sought protection in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act ('CCAA') on March 22, March 8, and March 12, 2019 respectively. CCAA is a Canadian federal law that permits a Canadian business to restructure its affairs while carrying on its business in the ordinary course. The initial CCAA order made by the Ontario Superior Court on March 22, 2019 authorizes RBH to pay all expenses incurred  in  carrying  on  its  business  in  the  ordinary  course  after  the  CCAA  filing,  including  obligations  to  employees,  vendors,  and suppliers.  As  further  described  in  Note  20. Deconsolidation  of  RBH ,  RBH's  financial  results  have  been  deconsolidated  from  our consolidated financial statements since March 22, 2019. As part of the CCAA proceedings, there is currently a comprehensive stay up to and including March 31, 2022 of all tobacco-related litigation pending in Canada against RBH and the other defendants, including PMI and our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria), namely, the smoking and health class actions filed in various Canadian provinces and health care cost recovery actions. These proceedings are presented below under the caption ' Stayed Litigation - Canada .'  Ernst &amp; Young Inc. has been appointed as monitor of RBH in the CCAA proceedings. In accordance with the CCAA process, as the parties work towards a plan of arrangement or compromise in a confidential mediation, it is anticipated that the court will set additional hearings and further extend the stay of proceedings. On April 17, 2019, the Ontario Superior Court ruled that RBH and the other defendants will not be allowed to file an application to the Supreme Court of Canada for leave to appeal the Court of Appeal's decision in the L\u00e9tourneau and the Blais cases so long as the comprehensive stay of all tobacco-related litigation in Canada remains in effect and that the time period to file the application would be extended by the stay period. While RBH believes that the findings of liability and damages in both L\u00e9tourneau and the Blais cases were incorrect, the CCAA proceedings will provide a forum for RBH to seek resolution through a plan of arrangement or compromise of all tobacco-related litigation pending in Canada. It is not possible to predict the resolution of the underlying legal proceedings or the length of the CCAA process.\n\nStayed Litigation - Canada\n\n## Smoking and Health Litigation - Canada\n\nIn the first class action pending in Canada, Conseil Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Sur Le Tabac Et La Sant\u00e9 and Jean-Yves Blais v. Imperial Tobacco Ltd., Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. and JTI-Macdonald Corp., Quebec Superior Court, Canada ,  filed in November 1998, RBH and other Canadian cigarette manufacturers (Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd. and JTI-Macdonald Corp.) are defendants. The plaintiffs, an anti-smoking organization and an individual smoker, sought compensatory and punitive damages for each member of the class who suffers allegedly from certain smoking-related diseases. The class was certified in 2005. The trial court issued its judgment on May 27, 2015. The trial court found RBH and two other Canadian manufacturers liable and found that the class members' compensatory damages totaled approximately CAD 15.5 billion, including pre-judgment interest (approximately $12.1 billion). The trial court awarded compensatory damages on a joint and several liability basis, allocating 20% to our subsidiary (approximately CAD 3.1 billion, including pre-judgment interest (approximately $2.4  billion)).  In  addition,  the  trial  court  awarded  CAD  90,000  (approximately  $70,500)  in  punitive  damages,  allocating  CAD  30,000 (approximately $23,500) to RBH. The trial court estimated the disease class at 99,957 members. RBH appealed to the Court of Appeal of Quebec. In October 2015, the Court of Appeal ordered RBH to furnish security totaling CAD 226 million (approximately $177 million) to cover both the L\u00e9tourneau and Blais cases, which RBH has paid in installments through March 2017. The Court of Appeal ordered Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd. to furnish security totaling CAD 758 million (approximately $594 million) in installments through June 2017. JTI Macdonald Corp. was not required to furnish security in accordance with plaintiffs' motion. The Court of Appeal ordered that the security is payable upon a final judgment of the Court of Appeal affirming the trial court's judgment or upon further order of the Court of Appeal.",

          "chunk_text": "## Executive Summary\n\nThe following executive summary provides the business update and significant highlights from the Discussion and Analysis that follows.\n\nImpairment Related to the Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Equity Investment\n\nOn October 17, 2024, the court-appointed mediator and monitor in the CCAA proceedings filed a proposed plan of compromise and arrangement ('Proposed Plan') setting forth, among other things, certain terms of a proposed comprehensive resolution of Canadian tobacco claims and related litigation. Under the resolution contemplated by the Proposed Plan, RBH, Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited (\"ITL\") and JTI Macdonald Corp (\"JTIM\") would pay an aggregate global settlement amount of CAD 32.5 billion (approximately $22.3 billion). A significant determinative factor in the analysis of impairment indicators was the issue of allocation of CAD 32.5 billion aggregate settlement amount among RBH, ITL, and JTIM which remained unresolved at the time of filing. On January 24, 2025, RBH filed an objection to approval of the Proposed Plan with the CCAA court (for further details, see Item 8, Note 18. Contingencies ). Developments, including the positions taken by RBH in this objection and the positions taken by other parties in related filings narrowed the range of possible outcomes with respect to the allocation of the aggregate settlement amount of  CAD 32.5 billion among  RBH,  ITL, and  JTIM, which was determined to be an indicator that  PMI's investment in  RBH may be impaired. Although there remains some uncertainty as to the final terms of the Proposed plan, PMI evaluated its investment in RBH for potential impairment and concluded that the estimated fair value of its investment in RBH was lower than its carrying value. As a result, PMI performed a quantitative valuation of its investment in RBH as of December 31, 2024, and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $2,316 million (representing a diluted EPS charge of $1.49 per share) in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024, as a recognized subsequent event. For further details, see Item 8, Note 6. Related Parties - Equity Investments and Other .\n\n## Consolidated Operating Results\n\n- Net Revenues Net revenues of $37.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, increased by $2.7 billion, or 7.7%, from the comparable 2023 amount. The change in our net revenues from the comparable 2023 amount was driven by the following (variances not to scale):\n\nNet revenues increased by 7.7%. Net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 10.1%, mainly reflecting: a favorable pricing variance, primarily driven by higher combustible tobacco pricing; and favorable volume/mix, driven by higher smoke-free products volume, partly offset by unfavorable cigarette mix, as well as a favorable comparison to 2023 reflecting a charge in the first quarter of 2023 of $80 million following the termination of a distribution arrangement in the Middle East, shown in \"Other.\" The termination of a distribution arrangement in the Middle East is further described in the following \" Diluted Earnings Per Share \" discussion.",

      "answer": "In 2022, The Coca-Cola Company stated that U.S. bottlers were generally not authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, and instead, the Company itself manufactured and sold fountain syrups directly to authorized fountain wholesalers (including some bottlers) and certain fountain retailers. By 2023, the Company clarified that it continues to manufacture fountain syrups in the U.S., but now explicitly states that it sells these syrups to both fountain retailers and authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who then distribute them to fountain retailers. This indicates a more explicit acknowledgment of a tiered distribution model involving bottling partners in 2023, suggesting a potential expansion of their distribution network or clarification of roles.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, KO maintained control over fountain syrup manufacturing in the U.S., selling directly to fountain wholesalers and some retailers, with bottlers excluded from production.",

        "Step 3: The change reflects a more detailed articulation of the distribution chain, suggesting a potential evolution in how KO structures its relationships with bottlers in the context of fountain syrup delivery."

          "chunk_text": "## Bottler's Agreements Outside the United States\n\nBottler's agreements between us and our authorized bottlers outside the United States generally are of stated duration, subject in some cases to possible extensions or renewals. Generally, these bottler's agreements are subject to termination by the Company following the occurrence of certain designated events, including defined events of default and certain changes in ownership or control of the bottlers. Most of the bottler's agreements in force between us and bottlers outside the United States authorize the bottlers to manufacture and distribute fountain syrups, usually on a nonexclusive basis.\n\nIn certain parts of the world outside the United States, we have not granted comprehensive beverage production and distribution rights to the bottlers. In such instances, we have authorized certain bottlers to (1) prepare and package Company Trademark Beverages for sale to other bottlers or (2) purchase Company Trademark Beverages from other bottlers for sale and distribution throughout their respective designated territories, often on a nonexclusive basis.\n\n## Bottler's Agreements Within the United States\n\nIn the United States, most bottlers operate under a contract to which we generally refer as a 'Comprehensive Beverage Agreement' ('CBA') that is of stated duration, subject in most cases to renewal rights of bottlers and in some cases to renewal rights of the Company. A small number of bottlers continue to operate under legacy bottler's agreements with no stated expiration date for Trademark Coca-Cola Beverages and other cola-flavored Company Trademark Beverages. In all instances, the bottler's agreements in the United States are subject to termination by the Company for nonperformance or upon the occurrence of certain defined events of default that may vary from contract to contract.\n\nCertain U.S. bottlers have been granted certain additional exclusive territory rights for the distribution, promotion, marketing and sale of Company-owned and licensed beverage brands (as defined by the CBAs). We refer to these bottlers as 'expanding participating bottlers' or 'EPBs.' EPBs operate under CBAs ('EPB CBAs') under which the Company generally retained the rights to produce the applicable beverage products for territories not covered by specific manufacturing agreements, and such bottlers purchase from the Company (or from Company-authorized manufacturing bottlers) substantially all of the finished beverage products needed in order to service the customers in these territories. Each EPB CBA has a term of 10 years and is renewable, in most cases by the bottler, and in some cases by the Company, indefinitely for successive additional terms of 10 years each and includes additional requirements that provide for, among other things, a binding national governance model, mandatory incidence pricing and certain core performance requirements. The Company has also entered into manufacturing agreements that authorize certain EPBs that have executed EPB CBAs to manufacture certain beverage products for their own account and for supply to other bottlers.\n\nIn addition, certain U.S. bottlers that were not granted additional exclusive territory rights, which we refer to as 'participating bottlers,' converted their legacy bottler's agreements to CBAs, to which we refer as 'participating bottler CBAs,' each of which has a term of 10 years, is renewable by the bottler indefinitely for successive additional terms of 10 years each, and is substantially similar in most material respects to the EPB CBAs, including with respect to requirements for a binding national governance model and mandatory incidence pricing, but includes core performance requirements that vary in certain respects from those in the EPB CBAs.\n\nThose bottlers that have not signed CBAs continue to operate under legacy bottler's agreements that include pricing formulas that generally provide for a baseline price for Trademark Coca-Cola Beverages and other cola-flavored Company Trademark Beverages. This baseline price may be adjusted periodically by the Company, up to a maximum indexed ceiling price, and is adjusted quarterly based upon changes in certain sugar or sweetener prices, as applicable. The U.S. unit case volume prepared, packaged, sold and distributed under these legacy bottler's agreements is not material.\n\nUnder the terms of the bottler's agreements, bottlers in the United States generally are not authorized to manufacture fountain syrups. Rather, the Company manufactures and sells fountain syrups to authorized fountain wholesalers (including certain authorized bottlers) and some fountain retailers. These wholesalers in turn sell the syrups, or deliver them on our behalf, to restaurants and other retailers.\n\n## Promotional and Marketing Programs\n\nIn addition to conducting our own independent advertising and marketing activities, we may provide promotional and marketing support and/or funds to our bottlers. In most cases, we do this on a discretionary basis under the terms of commitment letters or agreements, even though we are not obligated to do so under the terms of the bottler's agreements between our Company and the bottlers. Also, on a discretionary basis in most cases, our Company may develop and introduce new products, packages and equipment to assist the bottlers. Likewise, in many instances, we provide promotional and marketing support and/or funds and/or dispensing equipment and repair services to fountain and bottle/can retailers, typically pursuant to marketing agreements. The aggregate amount provided by our Company to bottlers, resellers and other customers of our Company's products, principally for participation in promotional and marketing programs, was $4.7 billion in 2021.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Coca-Cola's relationship with syrups was primarily defined by its sales to both consolidated and unconsolidated bottling partners, with revenue and volume recognition dependent on the ownership structure of those partners. Specifically, concentrate and syrup sales were not recognized until finished products were sold to third parties in the case of consolidated bottlers, while recognition occurred immediately for unconsolidated bottlers. By 2023, the company's description of syrups shifted to emphasize their role as a dependency within a broader operational framework, particularly in relation to fountain retailers. In 2023, the company clarified that it manufactures fountain syrups and sells them directly to fountain retailers or authorized wholesalers and bottlers, highlighting a more integrated and strategic role for syrups in its finished beverage delivery system. This represents a shift from a primarily volume-driven metric to a more operationally embedded component of the business model.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, the company described syrup sales primarily in terms of concentrate sales volume and revenue recognition timing based on bottler ownership structure.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the company emphasized the dependency of fountain retailers on syrups and described a more integrated supply chain involving direct syrup sales to various distribution points.",
        "Step 3: The change indicates a shift from a transactional view of syrups as a product sold to bottlers to a more strategic view of syrups as a foundational element enabling broader beverage delivery systems, particularly in fountain operations."

          "chunk_text": "differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year and for the manner in which the differences are expected to reverse. Based on the evaluation of all available information, the Company recognizes future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not.\n\nWe evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results; the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences; taxable income in prior carryback years (if permitted); and the availability of tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is required to be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that the Company will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset.\n\nThe Company does not record a U.S. deferred tax liability for the excess of the book basis over the tax basis of its investments in foreign subsidiaries to the extent that the basis difference meets the indefinite reversal criteria. These criteria are met if the foreign subsidiary has invested, or will invest, the undistributed earnings indefinitely. The decision as to the amount of undistributed earnings that the Company intends to maintain in non-U.S. subsidiaries takes into account items including, but not limited to, forecasts and budgets of financial needs of cash for working capital, liquidity plans, capital improvement programs, merger and acquisition plans, and planned loans to other non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company also evaluates its expected cash requirements in the United States. Other factors that can influence that determination are local restrictions on remittances (for example, in some countries a central bank application and approval are required in order for the Company's local country subsidiary to pay a dividend), economic stability and asset risk. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Operations Review\n\nOur organizational structure consists of the following operating segments: Europe, Middle East and Africa; Latin America; North America; Asia Pacific; Global Ventures; and Bottling Investments. Our operating structure also includes Corporate, which consists of a center and a platform services organization. For additional information regarding our operating segments and Corporate, refer to Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands\n\nIn order to continually improve upon the Company's operating performance, from time to time, we engage in buying and selling ownership interests in bottling partners and other manufacturing operations. In addition, we also acquire brands and their related operations or enter into license agreements for certain brands to supplement our beverage offerings. These items impact our operating results and certain key metrics used by management in assessing the Company's performance.\n\nUnit case volume growth is a metric used by management to evaluate the Company's performance because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. The Company's unit case volume represents the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers and, therefore, reflects unit case volume for both consolidated and unconsolidated bottlers. Refer to the heading 'Beverage Volume' below.\n\nConcentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished products sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, concentrate sales volume represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents), sold by the Company to customers or consumers. Refer to the heading 'Beverage Volume' below.\n\nWhen we analyze our net operating revenues, we generally consider the following factors: (1) volume growth (concentrate sales volume or unit case volume, as applicable); (2) changes in price, product and geographic mix; (3) foreign currency fluctuations; and (4) acquisitions and divestitures (including structural changes defined below), as applicable. Refer to the heading 'Net Operating Revenues' below. The Company sells concentrates and syrups to both consolidated and unconsolidated bottling partners. The ownership structure of our bottling partners impacts the timing of recognizing concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our consolidated bottling partners, we do not recognize the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume until the bottling partner has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our unconsolidated bottling partners, we recognize the concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume when the concentrates or syrups are sold to the bottling partner. The subsequent sale of the finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party does not impact the timing of recognizing the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume. When we account for an unconsolidated bottling partner as an equity method investment, we eliminate the intercompany profit related to these transactions to the extent of our ownership interest until the equity method investee has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to",

      "answer": "In 2022, Coca-Cola explicitly stated that it manufactured fountain syrups in the United States and sold them directly to fountain retailers or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners for further distribution. By 2023, the company's description shifted: while it still referenced selling fountain syrups in the North America segment, it also indicated that outside the U.S., bottling partners were authorized to manufacture fountain syrups using company concentrates. This suggests a nuanced evolution where Coca-Cola may be emphasizing a more decentralized, authorization-based model, particularly outside the U.S., while maintaining direct control within the U.S. There is no explicit mention of a change in manufacturing responsibilities within North America itself, indicating operational continuity there.",

          "chunk_text": "## Bottler's Agreements Outside the United States\n\nBottler's agreements between us and our authorized bottlers outside the United States generally are of stated duration, subject in some cases to possible extensions or renewals. Generally, these bottler's agreements are subject to termination by the Company following the occurrence of certain designated events, including defined events of default and certain changes in ownership or control of the bottlers. Most of the bottler's agreements in force between us and bottlers outside the United States authorize the bottlers to manufacture and distribute fountain syrups, usually on a nonexclusive basis.\n\nIn certain parts of the world outside the United States, we have not granted comprehensive beverage production and distribution rights to the bottlers. In such instances, we have authorized certain bottlers to (1) prepare and package Company Trademark Beverages for sale to other bottlers or (2) purchase Company Trademark Beverages from other bottlers for sale and distribution throughout their respective designated territories, often on a nonexclusive basis.\n\n## Bottler's Agreements Within the United States\n\nIn the United States, most bottlers operate under a contract to which we generally refer as a 'Comprehensive Beverage Agreement' ('CBA') that is of stated duration, subject in most cases to renewal rights of bottlers and in some cases to renewal rights of the Company. A small number of bottlers continue to operate under legacy bottler's agreements with no stated expiration date for Trademark Coca-Cola Beverages and other cola-flavored Company Trademark Beverages. In all instances, the bottler's agreements in the United States are subject to termination by the Company for nonperformance or upon the occurrence of certain defined events of default that may vary from contract to contract.\n\nCertain U.S. bottlers have been granted certain additional exclusive territory rights for the distribution, promotion, marketing and sale of Company-owned and licensed beverage brands (as defined by the CBAs). We refer to these bottlers as 'expanding participating bottlers' or 'EPBs.' EPBs operate under CBAs ('EPB CBAs') under which the Company generally retained the rights to produce the applicable beverage products for territories not covered by specific manufacturing agreements, and such bottlers purchase from the Company (or from Company-authorized manufacturing bottlers) substantially all of the finished beverage products needed in order to service the customers in these territories. Each EPB CBA has a term of 10 years and is renewable, in most cases by the bottler, and in some cases by the Company, indefinitely for successive additional terms of 10 years each and includes additional requirements that provide for, among other things, a binding national governance model, mandatory incidence pricing and certain core performance requirements. The Company has also entered into manufacturing agreements that authorize certain EPBs that have executed EPB CBAs to manufacture certain beverage products for their own account and for supply to other bottlers.\n\nIn addition, certain U.S. bottlers that were not granted additional exclusive territory rights, which we refer to as 'participating bottlers,' converted their legacy bottler's agreements to CBAs, to which we refer as 'participating bottler CBAs,' each of which has a term of 10 years, is renewable by the bottler indefinitely for successive additional terms of 10 years each, and is substantially similar in most material respects to the EPB CBAs, including with respect to requirements for a binding national governance model and mandatory incidence pricing, but includes core performance requirements that vary in certain respects from those in the EPB CBAs.\n\nThose bottlers that have not signed CBAs continue to operate under legacy bottler's agreements that include pricing formulas that generally provide for a baseline price for Trademark Coca-Cola Beverages and other cola-flavored Company Trademark Beverages. This baseline price may be adjusted periodically by the Company, up to a maximum indexed ceiling price, and is adjusted quarterly based upon changes in certain sugar or sweetener prices, as applicable. The U.S. unit case volume prepared, packaged, sold and distributed under these legacy bottler's agreements is not material.\n\nUnder the terms of the bottler's agreements, bottlers in the United States generally are not authorized to manufacture fountain syrups. Rather, the Company manufactures and sells fountain syrups to authorized fountain wholesalers (including certain authorized bottlers) and some fountain retailers. These wholesalers in turn sell the syrups, or deliver them on our behalf, to restaurants and other retailers.\n\n## Promotional and Marketing Programs\n\nIn addition to conducting our own independent advertising and marketing activities, we may provide promotional and marketing support and/or funds to our bottlers. In most cases, we do this on a discretionary basis under the terms of commitment letters or agreements, even though we are not obligated to do so under the terms of the bottler's agreements between our Company and the bottlers. Also, on a discretionary basis in most cases, our Company may develop and introduce new products, packages and equipment to assist the bottlers. Likewise, in many instances, we provide promotional and marketing support and/or funds and/or dispensing equipment and repair services to fountain and bottle/can retailers, typically pursuant to marketing agreements. The aggregate amount provided by our Company to bottlers, resellers and other customers of our Company's products, principally for participation in promotional and marketing programs, was $4.7 billion in 2021.",

      "question": "How has the role of syrups in Coca-Cola's business model evolved between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of their relationship to finished beverage production and distribution channels?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Coca-Cola described syrups as intermediate products used primarily in fountain beverage production, where bottling partners or fountain retailers mix them with water and sweeteners to create finished beverages for immediate consumption. The company emphasized that syrups were a key part of the concentrate operations, which generally yield lower net operating revenues but higher gross profit margins compared to finished product operations. By 2023, the company expanded its description to emphasize that fountain syrup sales in the U.S. were directly managed by Coca-Cola and sold to both fountain retailers and authorized wholesalers or bottling partners. Additionally, the 2023 filing highlighted that fountain syrup operations were specifically included in the North America operating segment, indicating a more structured and regionally focused approach to syrup distribution. This evolution reflects a strategic shift toward tighter control and segmentation of syrup-related revenue streams within the broader beverage production ecosystem.",

        "In 2022, syrups were defined as intermediate products used in both fountain and finished beverage production, with a focus on their role in the concentrate operations and the relative profitability compared to finished products.",

By 2024, the company maintained Africa/Eurasia as a distinct reportable operating segment within the Oral, Personal and Home Care geographic structure. Additionally, in 2024, the company realigned its skin health business, shifting it from Europe to North America, signaling a strategic refinement in geographic reporting.

Segment Information\n\nThe Company operates in two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition.\n\nThe operations of the Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment are managed geographically in five reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Africa/Eurasia.\n\nIn connection with management changes, the Company realigned the reporting structure of its skin health business effective July 1, 2024. Accordingly, commencing with the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the results of the skin health business previously reported within the Europe reportable operating segment are reported with the other skin health businesses in the North America reportable operating segment, with no impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial position. The Company has recast its historical geographic segment information to conform to the new reporting structure.\n\nThe Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including Operating profit. The Company uses Operating profit as a measure of operating segment performance because it excludes the impact of Corporate-driven decisions related to interest expense and income taxes. The Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer has been determined to be the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker who uses Operating Profit to assess performance and to allocate resources for each of the reportable operating segments in the budgeting and forecasting process. Asset information by segment is not utilized for purposes of assessing performance or allocating resources, and therefore such information has not been presented.\n\nThe accounting policies of the operating segments are generally the same as those described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Intercompany sales have been eliminated. Corporate operations include costs related to stock options and restricted stock units, research and development costs, Corporate overhead costs, restructuring and related implementation charges and gains and losses on sales of non-core product lines and assets. The Company reports these items within Corporate operations as they relate to Corporate-based responsibilities and decisions and are not included in the internal measures of segment operating performance used by the Company to measure the underlying performance of the operating segments.\n\nApproximately two-thirds of the Company's Net sales are generated from markets outside the U.S., with approximately 45% of the Company's Net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of Latin America, Asia (excluding Japan), Africa/Eurasia and Central Europe). Oral, Personal and Home Care sales to Walmart, Inc. and its affiliates represent approximately 11% of the Company's Net sales in each of the years 2024, 2023 and 2022. No other customer represented more than 10% of Net sales in any period presented.\n\nIn 2024, Corporate Operating profit included charges resulting from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative of $85. In 2023, Corporate Operating profit included charges resulting from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative of $27 and product recall costs of $25. In 2022, Corporate Operating profit included goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges of $721, charges resulting from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative of $95, a gain on the sale of land in Asia Pacific of $47 and acquisition-related costs of $19.",

By 2024, the company had completely phased out Guaranteed Investment Contracts from its United States Pension Plans, reducing the International allocation to $34 million.

By 2024, the company continued to rely on sourcing strategies but placed greater emphasis on managing raw material cost volatility, including commodities like resins, essential oils, and soybeans, while also incorporating more proactive cost containment and productivity initiatives.

          "chunk_text": "## COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Dollars in Millions Except Share and Per Share Amounts)\n\n## 7.    Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments\n\nThe Company uses available market information and other valuation methodologies in assessing the fair value of financial instruments. Judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value and, accordingly, changes in assumptions or the estimation methodologies may affect the fair value estimates. The Company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material, as it is the Company's policy to contract only with diverse, credit-worthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations.\n\nThe Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, sourcing strategies, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Company's treasury and risk management policies, which prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose. It is the Company's policy to enter into derivative instrument contracts with terms that match the underlying exposure being hedged. Provided below are details of the Company's exposures by type of risk and derivative instruments by type of hedge designation.\n\n## Valuation Considerations\n\nThe Company's derivative instruments include interest rate swap contracts, forward-starting interest rate swaps, foreign currency contracts and commodity contracts. The Company utilizes interest rate swap contracts to manage its targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt, and these swaps are classified as follows:\n\n- Level 1: Based upon quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n- Level 2: Based upon observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.\n- Level 3: Based upon unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity's own assumptions.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk\n\nAs the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, sourcing strategies, selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements.\n\nThe Company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward and swap contracts, option contracts, foreign and local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities arising in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates (Level 2 valuation).\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nThe Company manages its targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The Company utilizes forwardstarting interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of variability in interest rate for future debt issuances. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates (Level 2 valuation).",

A significant disruption to any of our key office facilities for any reason, including those mentioned above, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n## Volatility in material and other costs has in the past and may continue to adversely impact our profitability.\n\nRaw and packaging material commodities, such as resins, essential oils, tropical oils, pulp, tallow, corn, poultry and soybeans, are subject to market price variations. Increases in the costs of and/or a reduction in the availability of commodities, energy (including fuel prices), logistics (including trucks and containers) or other necessary services, including as a result of geopolitical conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East, and/or the impact of climatic events have affected and are likely to continue to adversely affect our profit margins. While the prices of many commodities and services have retreated from their historical peaks, prices may increase again, which could create year-over-year inflationary pressure. We have taken and may continue to take actions to mitigate these cost increases in the form of price increases and efforts to achieve cost efficiencies in areas such as manufacturing and distribution, or otherwise manage the exposure through sourcing strategies, ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts. These actions may not, however, fully offset these higher costs and our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition have been and may continue to be adversely impacted. In addition, even if we are able to increase the prices of our products in response to commodity and other cost increases, we may not be able to sustain the price increases. If such price increases are sustained, they may negatively impact our sales volume, which can in turn negatively impact our margins and profitability. If competitors do not adjust their prices or if consumers decide not to pay higher prices and forego purchasing certain of our products or switch to 'private label' or lower-priced product offerings, sales declines, a deterioration in our profitability and loss of market share may occur which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. See 'Our business results are impacted by our ability to manage disruptions in our global supply chain and/or key office facilities' above for additional information.\n\n## There is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful.\n\nOne way that we generate funds needed to support the growth of our business is through our continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization, which we refer to as our funding-the-growth initiatives. These initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect ex penses, distribution and logistics, and advertising and promotional materials, among other things. The achievement of our funding-the-growth goals depends on our ability to successfully identify and realize additional savings opportunities. Events and circumstances, such as financial or strategic difficulties, delays and unex pected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing any or all of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our ex pected timetable. If we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of our funding-the-growth initiatives, our ability to fund other initiatives and achieve our profitability goals may be adversely affected. Any failure to implement our funding-the-growth initiatives in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For additional information regarding our funding-the-growth initiatives, refer to Part II, Item 7 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Overview.'\n\n## A cybersecurity incident, data breach or a failure of key technology systems could adversely impact our business.\n\nWe rely extensively on information and operational technology systems ('IT/OT Systems'), some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties, including cloud-based service providers, and their vendors, in order to conduct our business. Our uses of these systems include, but are not limited to:\n\n- communicating within our company and with other parties, including our customers, suppliers and consumers;\n- ordering and managing materials from suppliers;\n- converting materials to finished products;\n- receiving and processing orders from, shipping products to and invoicing our customers, suppliers and consumers;\n- marketing products to consumers;",

Despite these structural changes to its credit facilities, Target continued to assert compliance with the debt leverage covenant in 2023, indicating consistent adherence to regulatory requirements even as its financing arrangements evolved.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, Target had a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in 2026 and affirmed compliance with the debt leverage covenant.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, Target added a new $1.0 billion 364-day credit facility, terminated the prior short-term facility, and extended the five-year facility to 2028, while continuing to assert compliance with the debt leverage covenant.",
        "Step 3: The evolution shows that although Target modified its credit structure, it maintained compliance with the debt leverage covenant across both years."

Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same as described above. Fitch raised our long-term debt rating from A- to A during 2021.\n\nIn 2021, we issued $2.0 billion of debt, and we repaid $1.1 billion of debt at maturity.\n\nIn 2021, we obtained a committed $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire in October 2026. This new facility replaced our $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that was set to expire in October 2023. No balances were outstanding under either credit facility at any time during 2021 or 2020.\n\nMost of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. In addition to a secured debt level covenant, our  credit  facility  also  contains  a  debt  leverage  covenant.  We  are,  and  expect  to  remain,  in  compliance  with  these  covenants. Additionally, as of January 29, 2022, no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a credit rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (i) a change in control and (ii) our long-term credit ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is  non-investment  grade,  or  our  long-term  credit  ratings  are  placed  on  watch  for  possible  reduction  and  those  ratings  are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade.\n\nNote 16 to the Financial Statements provides additional information.\n\n## Future Cash Requirements\n\nWe enter into contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business that may require future cash payments. Such obligations include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  purchase  commitments,  debt  service,  leasing  arrangements,  and  liabilities  related  to  deferred compensation and pensions. The Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements provide additional information.\n\nWe believe our sources of liquidity, namely operating cash flows, credit facility capacity, and access to capital markets, will continue to  be  adequate  to  meet  our  contractual  obligations,  working  capital  and  capital  expenditure  requirements,  finance  anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives, fund debt maturities, pay dividends, and execute purchases under our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future.\n\nTARGET CORPORATION\n\n2021 Form 10-K",

In 2020 and 2021, governments took various measures in response to COVID-19, such  as  mandating  the  closure  of  certain  businesses  and  encouraging  or  requiring  citizens  to  avoid  large  gatherings.  To  date, virtually all of our stores, digital channels, and distribution centers have remained open.\n\nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced strong comparable sales growth and significant volatility in our sales category and channel mix.\n\n## Supply Chain Disruptions\n\nIn recent months, we have seen increasing supply chain disruptions. In addition to country of origin production delays, trucker and dockworker shortages, a broad-based surge in consumer demand, and other factors have led to industry-wide U.S. port and ground transportation delays. In response, we have taken various actions, including ordering merchandise earlier, securing ocean freight routes, and increased use of air transport for certain merchandise. Some of these supply chain disruptions and resulting actions have resulted in increased costs. The Gross Margin Rate analysis on page 22 provides additional information.\n\n## Sale of Dermstore\n\nIn February 2021, we sold Dermstore LLC (Dermstore) for $356 million in cash and recognized a $335 million pretax gain, which is included  in  Net  Other  (Income)  /  Expense.

      "answer": "In the 2022 filing, the SPP II plan was described under the 2016 Plan Statement, as amended and restated effective April 3, 2016. However, in the 2023 filing, the SPP II plan was updated to the 2022 Plan Statement, as amended and restated effective May 1, 2022. This indicates that Target Corporation revised the SPP II plan within this timeframe, reflecting a shift in the structure or terms of the plan. Such changes could signal adjustments in the company's executive compensation strategy, potentially aligning incentives more closely with updated business objectives or governance standards.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, the SPP II plan was documented under the 2016 Plan Statement, as amended and restated effective April 3, 2016.",

        "Step 3: The change from the 2016 Plan Statement to the 2022 Plan Statement indicates an evolution in the SPP II plan terms, suggesting a strategic update to the executive compensation framework."

      "answer": "In 2022, the company disclosed that certain leases provided for periodic rent increases based on price indices or the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume, and these were accounted for on a straight-line basis. By 2024, the company clarified that such increases, based on price indices or the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume, are now recognized as variable lease payments rather than being straight-lined, indicating a shift in accounting treatment. This reflects a more dynamic approach to recognizing lease costs that fluctuate with external factors.",

        "Step 3: The change from a straight-line recognition to a variable payment treatment represents an evolution in how the company accounts for and discloses step-rent provisions, aligning more closely with variable cost recognition."

Certain leases provide for periodic rent increases based on price indices or the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume. Our leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\n\nThe Company determines at inception whether a contract is or contains a lease. Non-lease components and the lease components to which they relate are accounted for together as a single lease component for all asset classes. The Company initially records right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases based on the discounted future minimum lease payments over the term. The lease term is defined as the noncancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. As the rate implicit  in  the  Company's  leases  is  not  easily  determinable,  the  present  value  of  the  sum  of  the  lease  payments  is calculated using the Company's incremental borrowing rate. The rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest the Company would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. The Company uses quoted interest rates from financial institutions to derive the incremental borrowing rate. Impairment of ROU assets is evaluated in a similar manner as described in Property and Equipment, net above.\n\nThe Company's asset retirement obligations (ARO) primarily relate to leasehold improvements that must be removed at the end of a lease. These obligations are generally recorded as a discounted liability, with an offsetting asset at the inception  of  the  lease  term,  based  upon  the  estimated  fair  value  of  the  costs  to  remove  the  improvements.  These liabilities are accreted over time to the projected future value of the obligation. The ARO assets are depreciated using the same  depreciation method  as  the leasehold improvement  assets  and  are  included with buildings  and improvements.  Estimated  ARO  liabilities  associated  with  these  leases  are  included  in  other  liabilities  in  the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization.  The  Company  reviews  goodwill  annually  in  the  fourth  quarter  for  impairment  or  when  circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income approach estimates fair  value  based  on  expected  discounted  future  cash  flows,  while  the  market  approach  uses  comparable  public companies and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\n\nGoodwill  is  included  in  other  long-term  assets  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheets.  The  following  table  summarizes goodwill by reportable segment:\n\n",

By 2024, the company provided significantly more detailed information, disclosing that in November 2023, the subsidiary issued four new Guaranteed Senior Notes totaling approximately $500 at fixed interest rates ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%, with maturities extending from 2033 to 2043.

MD&amp;A  is  provided  as  a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes  to  Financial  Statements  (Part  II,  Item  8  of  this  Form  10-K).  This  section  generally  discusses  the  results  of operations for  2022  compared to 2021. For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition  for  2021  compared  to  2020  refer  to  Part  II,  Item  7,  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial Condition  and  Results  of  Operations  in  our  fiscal  year  2021  Form  10-K,  which  was  filed  with  the  United  States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on October 6, 2021.\n\n## Overview\n\nWe believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales. Net sales includes our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary (gasoline,  pharmacy,  optical,  food  court,  hearing  aids,  and  tire  installation)  and  other  businesses  (e-commerce, business centers, travel and other). We define comparable sales as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members  and  the  amount  they  spend  on  each  visit  (average  ticket).  Sales  comparisons  can  also  be  particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to our international  operations);  inflation  and  changes  in  the  cost  of  gasoline  and  associated  competitive  conditions.  The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage our SG&amp;A expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term. Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and gross margins  are  also  impacted  by  our  competition,  which  is  vigorous  and  widespread,  across  a  wide  range  of  global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or  reliably  predict  general  economic  health  or  changes  in  competition,  we  believe  that  we  have  been  successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items, and through online offerings.\n\nOur philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short-term  on  maximizing  prices  charged,  but  instead  seek  to  maintain  what  we  believe  is  a  perception  among  our members of our 'pricing authority' - consistently providing the most competitive values. Merchandise costs in 2022 were impacted by inflation higher than what we have experienced in recent years. The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases. Those strategies can include, but are not limited to, working with our suppliers to share in absorbing cost increases, earlierthan-usual purchasing and in greater volumes, offering seasonal merchandise outside its season, as well as passing cost  increases  on  to  our  members.  Our  investments  in  merchandise  pricing  may  include  reducing  prices  on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin and gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage).\n\nWe  believe  our  gasoline  business  enhances  traffic  in  our  warehouses,  but  it  generally  has  a  lower  gross  margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline business. It also has lower SG&amp;A expenses as a percent of net sales compared to our non-gasoline business. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-",

At the end of 2022 and 2021, these insurance liabilities were $1,364 and $1,257 in the aggregate, respectively, and were included in accrued salaries and benefits and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, classified based on their nature.\n\nThe captive receives direct premiums, which are netted against the Company's premium costs in selling, general and administrative expenses, in the consolidated statements of income. The captive participates in a reinsurance program that includes other third-party participants. The reinsurance agreement is one year in duration, and new agreements are entered into by each participant at their discretion at the commencement of the next calendar year. The participant agreements and practices of the reinsurance program are designed to limit a participating members' individual risk. Income statement adjustments related to the reinsurance program and related impacts to the consolidated balance sheets are recognized as information becomes known. In the event the Company leaves the reinsurance program, the Company retains its primary obligation to the policyholders for prior activity.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nThe Company is exposed to foreign-currency exchange-rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. It manages these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact  of  fluctuations  of  foreign  exchange  on  known  future  expenditures  denominated  in  a  non-functional  foreigncurrency. The  contracts  relate  primarily  to  U.S.  dollar  merchandise  inventory  expenditures  made  by  the  Company's international subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for  derivative  hedge  accounting. The  Company  seeks  to  mitigate  risk  with  the  use  of  these  contracts  and  does  not intend to engage in speculative transactions. Some of these contracts contain credit-risk-related contingent features that require settlement of outstanding contracts upon certain triggering events. The aggregate fair value amounts of derivative  instruments  in  a  net  liability  position  and  the  amount  needed  to  settle  the  instruments  immediately  if  the credit-risk-related  contingent  features  were  triggered  were  immaterial  at  the  end  of  2022.  There  were  no  derivative instruments in a net liability position at the end of 2021. The aggregate notional amounts of open, unsettled forward foreign-exchange  contracts  were  $1,242  and  $1,331  at  the  end  of  2022  and  2021,  respectively.  See  Note  3  for information on the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts at the end of 2022 and 2021.\n\nThe  unrealized  gains  or  losses  recognized  in  interest  income  and  other,  net  in  the  accompanying  consolidated statements of income relating to the net changes in the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts were immaterial in 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\nThe  Company  is  exposed  to  fluctuations  in  prices  for  energy,  particularly  electricity  and  natural  gas,  and  other commodity products used in retail and manufacturing operations, which it seeks to partially mitigate through the use of fixed-price contracts for certain of its warehouses and other facilities, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. The Company also enters into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for its gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of",

      "answer": "In 2022, sovereign debt crises were mentioned as part of a broader set of macroeconomic factors that could adversely affect demand for Costco's products and services, influence the cost or ability to purchase inventory, and require a change in product mix. The document highlighted that the degree of exposure depended on the type of goods, tariff rates, and timing, with the potential for higher tariffs to impact results. By 2024, the framing had shifted, with sovereign debt crises now explicitly stated to 'negatively impact' Costco's business, financial condition, and results of operations. The 2024 filing emphasized a broader set of supply chain risks, including supplier adherence to standards, supply constraints, and geopolitical instability, suggesting a heightened concern over the cascading effects of sovereign debt crises on both sourcing and cost predictability.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, sovereign debt crises were listed among several macroeconomic risks that could impact Costco\u2019s demand, product mix, and sourcing costs, with exposure dependent on tariff rates and timing.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, sovereign debt crises were more strongly linked to negative impacts on Costco\u2019s business and financial results, with expanded language around supply chain vulnerabilities and supplier risks.",
        "Step 3: The shift from 'could adversely affect' in 2022 to 'negatively impact' in 2024 indicates a more direct and severe perception of the risk, suggesting an evolution in how Costco assesses the threat of sovereign debt crises on its operations and cost structure."

Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China and the United States, have affected the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs.

      "answer": "In 2022, Mondelez directly produced Cheese & Grocery products, generating $1,990 million in total net revenues from this category. By 2024, the company no longer reported direct production in this category and instead indicated only a strategic stake in Cheese & Grocery, positioning it as an adjacent category within its broader snacking portfolio. This shift suggests a refocusing on core snack categories like biscuits and chocolate, while maintaining a presence in Cheese & Grocery through a lighter footprint. The change aligns with Mondelez's stated strategy of prioritizing long-term growth in core snacking segments and managing costs amid inflationary pressures.",

        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 \u2014 In 2022, Mondelez directly produced Cheese & Grocery items, contributing $1,990 million in revenue.",

        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change \u2014 The shift from direct production to a strategic stake indicates a strategic refocusing on core snack categories, likely to streamline operations and prioritize growth areas amid macroeconomic pressures."

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\nThe following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements. It should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Forward-Looking Statements and Item 1A, Risk Factors .\n\n## Overview of Business and Strategy\n\nOur  core  business  is  making  and  selling  chocolate,  biscuits  and  baked  snacks,  with  additional  businesses  in  adjacent,  locally  relev ant  categories including gum &amp; candy, cheese &amp; grocery and powdered bev erages around the world.\n\nWe aim to be the global leader in snacking. Our strategy is to driv e long-term growth by focusing on four strategic priorities: accelerating consumercentric  growth,  driv ing  operational  excellence,  creating  a  winning  growth  culture  and  scaling  sustainable  snacking.  We  believ e  the  successful implementation of our strategic priorities and lev eraging of our attractiv e global footprint, strong core of iconic global and local brands, marketing, sales, distribution  and  cost  excellence  capabilities,  and  top  talent  with  a  growth  mindset,  will  driv e  consistent  top-  and  bottom-line  growth,  enabling  us  to continue to create long-term v alue for our shareholders.\n\nFor more detailed information on our business and strategy, refer to Item 1, Business.\n\n## Recent Developments and Significant Items Affecting Comparability\n\n## Macroeconomic environment\n\nWe continue to observ e significant market and geopolitical uncertainty, fluctuating consumer demand, inflationary pressures, supply constraints, trade and regulatory uncertainty and exchange rate v olatility. As a result, we experienced significantly higher operating costs, including higher ov erall raw material, labor and energy costs that hav e continued to rise. In particular, we expect to continue to face higher cocoa costs, as the market price for cocoa beans has increased significantly year-ov er-year and it is likely that prices will remain elev ated for some time. Refer to Commodity Trends for additional information.\n\nOur overall outlook for future snacks rev enue growth remains strong; howev er, we anticipate ongoing v olatility. We will continue to proactiv ely manage our business in  response  to  the  ev olv ing  global  economic  env ironment,  related  uncertainty  and  business  risks  while  also  prioritizing  and  supporting  our employees and customers. We continue to take steps to mitigate impacts to our supply chain, operations, technology and assets.\n\nAdditionally, we prov ide more information on risks related to trade and regulatory uncertainty in our Financial Outlook section and under Item 1A, Risk Factors .\n\n## War in Ukraine\n\nIn February 2022, following the Russian military inv asion of Ukraine, we stopped production and closed our facilities in Ukraine; since then we hav e taken steps to protect the safety of our employees and to restore operations at our two manufacturing facilities, which were significantly damaged in March 2022. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies -War in Ukraine, to the consolidated financial statements, and refer to Items Affecting Comparability of Financial Results for additional information.\n\nWe have suspended new capital investments and our advertising spending in Russia, but as a food company with more than 2,500 employees in the country, we hav e not ceased operations giv en we believ e we play a role in the continuity of the food supply. We continue to ev aluate the situation in Ukraine  and  Russia  and  our  ability  to  control  our  operating  activ ities  and  businesses  on  an  ongoing  basis  and  comply  with  applicable  international sanctions. We continue to consolidate both our Ukrainian and Russian subsidiaries. During both 2024 and 2023, Ukraine generated 0.4% and Russia generated 2.9% of consolidated net rev enue. The profitability of and the assets held by our Russian business continue to remain abov e historic lev els. We cannot predict if the recent strength in our Russian business will continue in the future.\n\nOur operations in Russia are subject to risks, including the temporary or permanent loss of assets due to expropriation or further curtailment of our ability to conduct business operations in Russia.

We received $185 million of proceeds and recorded a pre-tax gain of $71 million (or $54 million after-tax) during the first quarter of 2020.\n\nDuring 2019, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $23 million (or $18 million after-tax) related to the impact of a KDP acquisition that decreased our ownership interest from 13.8% to 13.6%.\n\n## JDE Peet's Transaction:\n\nIn May 2020, JDE Peet's B.V. (renamed JDE Peet's N.V. immediately prior to Settlement (as defined below), 'JDE Peet's') consummated the offering, listing and trading of its ordinary shares on Euronext Amsterdam, a regulated market operated by Euronext Amsterdam N.V. In connection with this transaction, JDE Peet's and the selling shareholders, including us, agreed to sell at a price of \u20ac31.50 per ordinary share a total of approximately 82.1 million ordinary shares, including ordinary shares subject to an over-allotment option. The ordinary shares were listed and first traded on May 29, 2020, and payment for, and delivery of, the ordinary shares sold in the offering (excluding ordinary shares subject to the over-allotment option) took place on June 2, 2020 ('Settlement').\n\nPrior to Settlement, we exchanged our 26.4% ownership interest in JDE for a 26.5% equity interest in JDE Peet's. We did not invest new capital in connection with the transaction and the exchange was accounted for as a change in interest transaction. Upon Settlement, we sold approximately 9.7 million of our ordinary shares in JDE Peet's in the offering for gross proceeds of \u20ac304 million ($343 million). We subsequently sold approximately 1.4 million additional shares and received gross proceeds of \u20ac46 million ($51 million) upon exercise of the over-allotment option. Following Settlement and the exercise of the over-allotment option, we held a 22.9% equity interest in JDE Peet's. During the second quarter of 2020, we recorded a preliminary gain of $121 million, net of $33 million released from accumulated other comprehensive losses, and $48 million of transaction costs. During the third quarter of 2020, we increased our preliminary gain by $10 million to $131 million.\n\nOn September 20, 2021, we issued \u20ac300 million exchangeable bonds, which are redeemable at maturity at their principal amount in cash or, at our option, through the delivery of an equivalent number of JDE Peet's ordinary shares based on an initial exchange price of \u20ac35.40 and, as the case may be, an additional amount in cash. If all bonds were redeemed in exchange for JDE Peet's shares, this would represent approximately 8.5 million shares or approximately 7% of our equity interest in JDE Peet's. Refer to Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements , for further details on this transaction.\n\nAs was the case in our ownership interest in JDE, we have significant influence with respect to JDE Peet's, and we will continue to account for our investment in JDE Peet's under the equity method, resulting in recognizing our share of JDE Peet's earnings within our earnings and our share of JDE Peet's dividends within our cash flows.\n\n## Summary Financial Information for Equity Method Investments:\n\nSummarized financial information related to our equity method investments is reflected below.\n\n",

Our use of new and emerging technologies such as cloud-based serv ices and mobile applications continues to ev olv e, presenting new and additional risks in managing access to our data, relying on third parties to manage and safeguard data, ensuring access to our systems and av ailability of third-party systems. In addition, we are experiencing new and more frequent attempts by third parties to gain access to our systems, such as through increased email phishing of our workforce.\n\nOur  use  of  third-party  technology  and  business  serv ices  may  expose  us  to  cybersecurity  breaches.

Upon consolidation, we recognized a gain of $834 million resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in BodyArmor to fair value. The fair value of our previously held equity interest was determined using a discounted cash flow model based on Level 3 inputs. The gain was recorded in the line item other income (loss) - net in our consolidated statement of income. As of December 31, 2021, $4.2 billion of the purchase price was preliminarily allocated to the BodyArmor trademark and $2.2 billion was preliminarily allocated to goodwill, of which $1.2 billion is tax deductible. The goodwill recognized as part of this acquisition is primarily related to the synergistic value created from leveraging the capabilities, assets and scale of the Company and the opportunity for international expansion. It also includes certain other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, such as an assembled workforce. Of the total amount preliminarily allocated to goodwill, $1.9 billion has been assigned to the North America operating segment and $0.3 billion has been assigned to our other geographic operating segments.

Upon consolidation, we recognized a gain of $902 million resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in fairlife to fair value. The fair value of our previously held equity interest was determined using a discounted cash flow model based on Level 3 inputs. The gain was recorded in the line item other income (loss) - net in our consolidated statement of income. We acquired the remaining ownership interest in exchange for $979 million of cash, net of cash acquired, and effectively settled our $306 million note receivable from fairlife at the recorded amount. Under the terms of the agreement, we are subject to making future milestone payments which are contingent on fairlife achieving certain financial targets through 2024 and, if achieved, are payable in 2021, 2023 and 2025. These milestone payments are based on agreed-upon formulas related to fairlife's operating results, the resulting values of which are not subject to a ceiling. Under the applicable accounting guidance, we recorded a $270 million liability representing our best estimate of the fair value of this contingent consideration as of the acquisition date. The fair value of this contingent consideration was determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model based on Level 3 inputs, including management's latest estimates of future operating results. We are required to remeasure this liability to fair value quarterly with any changes in the fair value recorded in income until the final milestone payment is made. Upon finalization of purchase accounting, $1.3 billion of the purchase price was allocated to the fairlife trademark and $0.8 billion was allocated to goodwill. The goodwill recognized as part of this acquisition is primarily related to synergistic value created from the opportunity for additional expansion. It also includes certain other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, such as an assembled workforce. The goodwill is not tax deductible and has been assigned to the North America operating segment.\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded charges of $369 million and $51 million, respectively. These charges related to the remeasurement of the contingent consideration liability to fair value and were recorded in the line item other operating charges in our consolidated statements of income.

We believe this acquisition will allow us to increase our presence in the hot beverage market, as Costa has a scalable platform across multiple formats and channels, including opportunities to introduce ready-to-drink products. Upon finalization of purchase accounting, $2.4 billion of the purchase price was allocated to the Costa trademark and $2.5 billion was allocated to goodwill. The goodwill recognized as part of this acquisition is primarily related to synergistic value created from the opportunity for additional expansion as well as our ability to market and distribute Costa in ready-to-drink form throughout our bottling system. It also includes certain other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, such as an assembled workforce.

Our third-party service providers and business partners may not fulfill their respective commitments and responsibilities in a timely manner and in accordance with the agreedupon terms. In addition, while we have procedures in place for selecting and managing our relationships with third-party service providers and other business partners, we do not have control over their business operations or governance and compliance systems, practices and procedures, which increases our financial, legal, reputational and operational risk. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships, or for any reason our third-party service providers or business partners fail to satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities, our financial results could suffer.\n\n## If we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, or if we or our bottling partners experience strikes, work stoppages or labor unrest, our business could suffer.\n\nMany of our employees at our key manufacturing locations and bottling plants are covered by collective bargaining agreements. While we generally have been able to renegotiate collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire and regard our relations with employees and their representatives as generally satisfactory, negotiations may nevertheless be challenging, as the Company must have competitive cost structures in each market while meeting the compensation and benefits needs of our employees. If we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, our labor costs could increase, which could affect our profit margins. In addition, many of our bottling partners' employees are represented by labor unions. Strikes, work stoppages or other forms of labor unrest at any of our major manufacturing facilities or at our bottling operations or our major bottlers' plants could impair our ability to supply concentrates and syrups to our bottling partners or our bottlers' ability to supply finished beverages to customers, which could reduce our net operating revenues and could expose us to customer claims. Furthermore, from time to time we and our bottling partners restructure manufacturing and other operations to improve productivity, which may have negative impacts on employee morale and work performance, result in escalation of grievances and adversely affect the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements. If these labor relations are not effectively managed at the local level, they could escalate in the form of corporate campaigns supported by the labor organizations and could negatively affect our Company's overall reputation and brand image, which in turn could have a negative impact on our products' acceptance by consumers.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS\n\n## Obesity and other health-related concerns may reduce demand for some of our products.\n\nThere is growing concern among consumers, public health professionals and government agencies about the health problems associated with obesity. Increasing public concern about obesity; other health-related public concerns surrounding consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages; possible new or increased taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages by government entities to reduce consumption or to raise revenue; additional governmental regulations concerning the advertising, marketing, labeling, packaging or sale of our sugar-sweetened beverages; and negative publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against us or other companies in our industry relating to the marketing, labeling or sale of sugar-sweetened beverages may reduce demand for, or increase the cost of, our sugar-sweetened beverages, which could adversely affect our profitability.\n\n## If we do not address evolving consumer product and shopping preferences, our business could suffer.\n\nConsumer product preferences have evolved and continue to evolve as a result of, among other things, health, wellness and nutrition considerations, including concerns regarding caloric intake associated with sugar-sweetened beverages and the perceived undesirability of artificial ingredients; shifting consumer demographics; changes in consumer tastes and needs coupled with a rapid expansion of beverage options and delivery methods; changes in consumer lifestyles; concerns regarding location of origin or source of ingredients and raw materials and the environmental, social and sustainability impact of ingredient sources and the product manufacturing process; consumer emphasis on transparency related to ingredients we use in our products and collection and recyclability of, and amount of recycled content contained in, our packaging containers and other materials; concerns about the health and welfare of animals in our dairy supply chain; and competitive product and pricing pressures. In addition, in many of our markets, shopping patterns are being affected by the digital evolution, with consumers rapidly embracing shopping by way of mobile device applications, e-commerce retailers and e-commerce websites or platforms. If we fail to address changes in consumer product and shopping preferences, do not successfully anticipate and prepare for future changes in such preferences, or are ineffective or slow in developing and implementing appropriate digital transformation initiatives, our share of sales, revenue growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected.\n\n## Product safety and quality concerns could negatively affect our business.\n\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all of our products. We have rigorous product safety and quality standards, which we expect our operations as well as our bottling partners to meet. However, despite our strong commitment to product safety and quality, we or our bottling partners periodically have not met, and may not always meet, these standards, particularly as we expand our product offerings through innovation or acquisitions into beverage categories, such as value-added dairy and plant-based beverages, that are beyond our",

Such risks may be increased if government officials make public statements about alleged risks purportedly associated with processing, particular ingredients used in our products, or unintentional contaminants that may be present in the food or water supply.

We believe our future success will depend in part on our ability to adapt to and thrive in the digital environment and ex pand our digital capabilities. Therefore, one of our top priorities is to digitalize the Coca-Cola system by, among other things, creating more relevant and more personalized experiences wherever our system interacts with consumers, whether in a digital environment or through digital devices in an otherwise physical environment; finding ways to create more powerful digital tools and capabilities for the Coca-Cola system's retail customers to enable them to grow their businesses; and digitalizing operations through the use of data, artificial intelligence, automation, robotics and digital devices to increase efficiency and productivity. If we are not successful in our efforts to digitalize the Coca-Cola system, our ability to increase sales and improve margins may be negatively affected, and the cost and expenses we have incurred or may incur in connection with our digitalization initiatives may adversely impact our financial performance.\n\n## If negative publicity, whether or not warranted, concerning product safety or quality, workplace and human rights, obesity or other issues damages our brand image, corporate reputation and social license to operate, our business may suffer.\n\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to maintain the brand image of our existing products, build the brand image for new products and brand extensions, and maintain our corporate reputation and social license to operate. However, our continuing investment in advertising and marketing and our strong commitment to product safety and quality and human rights have not always had, and may not in the future always have, the desired impact on our products' brand image and on consumer preferences. Product safety or quality issues, actual or perceived, or allegations of product contamination, even when false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of the affected brands and may cause consumers to choose other products. In some emerging markets, the production and sale of counterfeit or 'spurious' products, which we and our bottling partners have not in the past been able, and may not in the future be able, to fully combat, may damage the image and reputation of our products. In addition, from time to time we and our executives have engaged, and may in the future engage, in public policy endeavors that are either directly related to our products and packaging or to our business operations and the general economic climate affecting the Company. These engagements in public policy debates have been, and could in the future be, the subject of criticism from advocacy groups or others that have a differing point of view and could result in adverse media and consumer reaction, including product boycotts. Similarly, our sponsorship relationships and associations with influencers and organizations have subjected us in the past, and could subject us in the future, to negative publicity as a result of actual or alleged misconduct by individuals, hosts or entities associated with organizations we sponsor or support financially or through in-kind contributions, as well as by the influencers we collaborate with who may engage in actions or ex press opinions that may negatively reflect on our brand. Likewise, campaigns by activists or others connecting us, or our bottling system or supply chain, with issues related to workplace policies and initiatives, or human rights or animal welfare, whether actual or perceived, could adversely impact our corporate image and reputation. Additionally, negative postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands, even if inaccurate or malicious, have in the past, and could in the future, generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the Company.

In addition, if we fail to respect our employees' and our supply chain workers' human rights, or inadvertently discriminate against any group of employees or hiring prospects, we could face legal risks and/or our ability to hire and retain the best talent will be diminished, which could have an adverse impact on our overall business.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Coca-Cola's acquisition-related disclosures referenced the 2020 acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in fairlife, with no mention of ongoing contingent payments. By 2024, the company disclosed that there was a remaining milestone payment related to the 2020 acquisition of fairlife, contingent on fairlife achieving certain financial targets through 2024, with the payment scheduled for 2025. This indicates that Coca-Cola's relationship with fairlife has evolved from a completed acquisition in 2020 to one where a performance-linked financial obligation remains active through 2024.",

The SCF program is available to suppliers of goods and services included in cost of goods sold as well as suppliers of goods and services included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income. The Company and our suppliers agree on the contractual terms for the goods and services we procure, including prices, quantities and payment terms, regardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in the SCF program. The suppliers sell goods or services, as applicable, to the Company and issue the associated invoices to the Company based on the agreed-upon contractual terms. Then, if they are participating in the SCF program, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, determine which invoices, if any, they want to sell to the financial institutions. Our suppliers' voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms. No guarantees are provided by the Company or any of our subsidiaries under the SCF program. We have no economic interest in a supplier's decision to participate in the SCF program, and we have no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions, as it relates to the SCF program. Accordingly, amounts due to our suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF program are included in the line item accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet. All activity related to amounts due to suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF program is reflected within the operating activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. We have been informed by the financial institutions that as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, suppliers had elected to sell $882 million and $703 million, respectively, of our outstanding payment obligations to the financial institutions. The amounts settled through the SCF program were $3,237 million and $2,810 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We do not believe there is a risk that our payment terms will be shortened in the near future.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company started a trade accounts receivable factoring program in certain countries. Under this program we can elect to sell trade accounts receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions at a discount. In these factoring arrangements, for ease of administration, the Company collects customer payments related to the factored receivables and remits those payments to the financial institutions. The Company sold $6,266 million and $185 million of trade accounts receivables under this program during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and the costs of factoring such receivables were not material. The cash received from the financial institutions is classified within the operating activities section in our consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $12,625 million and $9,844 million, respectively, an increase of $2,781 million, or 28 percent. This increase was primarily driven by increased operating income, which includes a benefit from our trade accounts receivable factoring program, a favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, lower annual incentive payments in 2021 as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operating performance in 2020, lower payments in 2021 of prior year-end marketing accruals due to lower spending in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and lower prepayments to customers in 2021. These items were partially offset by higher payments related to our strategic realignment initiatives along with higher tax payments in 2021.\n\n## Cash Flows from Investing Activities\n\nNet cash used in investing activities was $2,765 million and $1,477 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Purchases of Investments and Proceeds from Disposals of Investments\n\nIn 2021, purchases of investments were $6,030 million and proceeds from disposals of investments were $7,059 million, resulting in a net cash inflow of $1,029 million. In 2020, purchases of investments were $13,583 million and proceeds from disposals of investments were $13,835 million, resulting in a net cash inflow of $252 million. This activity primarily represents the purchases of, and proceeds from the disposals of, investments in marketable securities and short-term investments that were made as part of the Company's overall cash management strategy. Also included in this activity are purchases of, and proceeds from the disposals of, investments held by our captive insurance companies.\n\n## Acquisitions of Businesses, Equity Method Investments and Nonmarketable Securities\n\nIn 2021, the Company's acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $4,766 million, which primarily related to the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in BodyArmor.\n\nIn 2020, the Company's acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $1,052 million, which primarily related to the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in fairlife.\n\nRefer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our acquisitions.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Coca-Cola recognized a gain of $39 million from the partial sale of its ownership interest in Embotelladora Andina S.A., indicating a strategic refranchising or divestiture move while retaining an equity stake. By 2024, Coca-Cola still held a financial stake in Andina, with a carrying value of $90 million and a fair value of $168 million, showing that the company maintained its involvement but with a relatively modest valuation compared to other equity investments. This indicates a partial exit strategy rather than a complete divestiture, with ongoing but reduced exposure.",

We received cash proceeds of $1,738 million and recognized a net gain of $695 million as a result of the sale and the related reversal of cumulative translation adjustments. Also included were the sale of our ownership interest in an equity method investee and the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in another equity method investee. We received cash proceeds of $293 million and recognized a net gain of $114 million as a result of these sales.\n\nDuring 2020, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $189 million, which primarily related to the sale of our ownership interest in Piedmont Coca-Cola Bottling Partnership to Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc., an equity method investee. We received cash proceeds of $100 million and recognized a net loss of $2 million as a result of this sale. Also included were the sale of our ownership interest in an equity method investee and the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in another equity method investee. We received cash proceeds of $62 million and recognized a net gain of $35 million as a result of these sales.\n\nDuring 2019, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $429 million, which primarily related to the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in Embotelladora Andina S.A. ('Andina') and the refranchising of certain of our bottling operations in India. As a result of these transactions, we recognized gains of $39 million and $73 million, respectively. We continue to account for our remaining ownership interest in Andina as an equity method investment as a result of our representation on Andina's Board of Directors and other governance rights.\n\n## Coca-Cola Beverages Africa Proprietary Limited\n\nDue to the Company's original intent to refranchise Coca-Cola Beverages Africa Proprietary Limited ('CCBA'), it was accounted for as held for sale and as a discontinued operation from October 2017 through the first quarter of 2019. Additionally, CCBA's property, plant and equipment was not depreciated and its definite-lived intangible assets were not amortized during this period. While the Company had discussions with a number of potential partners throughout the period CCBA was held for sale, during the second quarter of 2019 the Company updated its plans with the intent to maintain its controlling stake in CCBA, which resulted in CCBA no longer qualifying as held for sale or as a discontinued operation. As a result of this change, we recorded a $160 million adjustment to reduce the carrying value of CCBA's property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets by an additional $34 million and $126 million, respectively, to reflect additional depreciation and amortization that would have been recognized during the period CCBA was held for sale. This adjustment was recorded in the line item other income (loss) - net in our consolidated statement of income.\n\n## Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had certain bottling operations in Asia Pacific that met the criteria to be classified as held for sale. As a result, we were required to record their assets and liabilities at the lower of carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. As the fair value less any costs to sell exceeded the carrying value, the related assets and liabilities were recorded at their carrying value. These assets and liabilities were included in the Bottling Investments operating segment. The Company expects these bottling operations to be refranchised during 2022.",

      "answer": "In 2023, MDLZ acquired Clif Bar, as noted in the 2023 10-K filing, with specific reference to the August 1, 2022 acquisition and related financial impacts such as integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments. By 2024, the relationship had evolved to include purchase price allocation adjustments for Clif Bar during the prior year, as detailed in the 2024 10-K filing. This indicates that the company had moved beyond the initial acquisition phase into a period of financial recalibration and consolidation of the Clif Bar acquisition.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, MDLZ acquired Clif Bar, and this acquisition contributed to increased selling, general, and administrative expenses, including integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments.",

        "Step 3: The change reflects a transformation in the relationship from acquisition to integration and financial consolidation, with a change magnitude classified as significant due to the complexity and financial impact of the adjustments."

The company expressed concern that failure to protect these rights or any legal changes reducing intellectual property protections\u2014especially in response to developments in artificial intelligence technologies\u2014could significantly harm its competitiveness and financial condition. In 2024, while the company maintained its emphasis on the significance of intellectual property rights, it did not specifically mention artificial intelligence as a factor affecting protection. Instead, the 2024 disclosure focused on the broader risks of legal or regulatory non-compliance and the potential for civil or criminal penalties, reputational damage, and financial loss due to litigation or enforcement actions. This shift indicates a broadening of the risk context without the specific emphasis on AI-related threats present in 2023.",

        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change \u2014 The focus of the risk shifted from a specific technological concern (AI) in 2023 to a more generalized legal and regulatory risk environment in 2024, indicating a transformation in how the company framed the risk to its know-how and intellectual property."

These risks could be heightened in light of increased pressure on our suppliers from supply chain challenges. In addition, if another company recalls or experiences negativ e publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete, consumers might reduce their ov erall consumption of products in this category. Any of these ev ents could materially and adv ersely affect our reputation, brands, product sales, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\n\nWe may also suffer losses when our products or operations or those of our suppliers v iolate applicable laws or regulations, or when our or our suppliers' products cause injury, illness or death.  In addition, our marketing could face claims of false or deceptiv e adv ertising or other criticism. A significant product liability or related claim or other legal judgment against us, a regulatory enforcement action, a widespread product recall or comments relating to the safety of our products could materially and adv ersely affect our reputation and profitability. Moreov er, ev en if a product liability, consumer fraud or other claim, litigation or inv estigation has no merit, is not pursued or is unsuccessful, the negativ e publicity surrounding assertions against our products or  processes or conduct could materially and adv ersely affect our reputation, brands, product sales, product inv entory, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and we could incur significant expense responding to such a claim, litigation or inv estigation. For example, a recent purported personal injury lawsuit filed against a number of food companies, including us ( Bryce Martinez vs. Kraft Heinz Co. Inc. et al. ), alleged that certain food products we and other companies make are addictiv e and cause health problems. While we believ e that this lawsuit is without merit and intend to v igorously defend ourselv es, we cannot predict the outcome or the impact of such litigation or similar lawsuits on our business or reputation. In addition, while we currently maintain insurance cov erage that, subject to its terms and conditions, is intended to address costs associated with certain aspects of product recalls, this insurance cov erage may not, depending on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding an incident, cov er all losses or all types of claims that arise from an incident, or the damage to our reputation or brands that may result from an incident.\n\n## We face risks related to legal or tax claims, litigation, investigations or other regulatory enforcement actions.\n\nWe operate around the world in env ironments with constantly ev olv ing legal, tax and regulatory frameworks, and we are subject to risk of litigation, legal or tax claims, inv estigations, or other regulatory enforcement actions. Actions by our employees, contractors, agents or others in v iolation of our policies and procedures could lead to deficiencies in our internal or other controls or v iolations, unintentional or otherwise, of laws and regulations. We could also be subject to litigation, legal claims, inv estigations or regulatory actions in connection with the continued ev olution of our sustainability and ESG-related initiativ es.  In  addition,  we  may  be  impacted  by  litigation  trends,  including  class  action,  indiv idual  or  multi-jurisdiction  lawsuits,  or  inv estigations  or enforcement actions inv olv ing consumers, employees, shareholders or other stakeholders. For example, as a global snacking company, we are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny and face legal challenges in a v ariety of jurisdictions concerning the alleged health implications of certain food products and our methods in marketing those products. When litigation, legal or tax claims, inv estigations or regulatory enforcement actions arise out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or controls, we could be subject to civ il and criminal penalties, and v oluntary and inv oluntary document requests, that could materially and adv ersely affect our reputation, product sales, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows  and  stock  price.  Ev en  if  a  claim,  lawsuit,  inv estigation,  enforcement  action  or  other  action  is  unsuccessful,  without  merit  or  not  pursued  to completion, the reputational impact or cost of responding to such a claim, including expenses and management time, could adv ersely affect us. We face risks related to adequately protecting our valuable intellectual property rights.\n\nWe  consider  our  intellectual  property  rights,  particularly  and  most  notably  our  trademarks,  but  also  our  patents,  copyrights,  registered  designs, proprietary trade secrets, recipes, technology, know-how and licensing agreements, to be a significant and v aluable part of our business.

      "answer": "In 2023, PMI announced a long-term collaboration with KT&G to commercialize KT&G's smoke-free devices and consumables on an exclusive, worldwide basis (excluding South Korea), under a 15-year agreement running through January 29, 2038. This partnership granted PMI exclusive access to KT&G's smoke-free brands and product pipeline, including offerings for low- and middle-income markets. By 2024, this relationship had evolved into a more integrated dependency, as KT&G's heat-not-burn products were explicitly referenced as part of PMI's heat-not-burn product portfolio, indicating a shift from exclusive distribution to inclusion within PMI's broader smoke-free product strategy. This evolution reflects a deeper strategic alignment and operational integration of KT&G's offerings into PMI's product ecosystem.",

        "Step 2: In 2024, KT&G's heat-not-burn products were referenced as part of PMI's own heat-not-burn product portfolio, showing that KT&G's products were now integral to PMI's smoke-free product line.",
        "Step 3: The shift from exclusive distribution rights to explicit product integration indicates a transformation in the relationship from a collaborative arrangement to a strategic dependency."

      "answer": "In 2022, Philip Morris described its heat-not-burn products as part of its Reduced-Risk Products (RRPs) portfolio, emphasizing their role in a smoke-free future and highlighting the IQOS Platform 1 device and various heated tobacco units (HTUs) such as HEETS and Marlboro HeatSticks. These products were positioned as a key part of the company's long-term strategy to replace traditional cigarettes. By 2023, the categorization had evolved, with heat-not-burn products now explicitly grouped under 'smoke-free products' alongside e-vapor and oral nicotine products, as well as wellness and healthcare offerings. Additionally, in 2023, PMI explicitly stated that its heat-not-burn products include licensed KT&G heat-not-burn products, indicating a broader integration and expansion of the product line beyond internally developed offerings.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, heat-not-burn products were described as part of the Reduced-Risk Products (RRPs) portfolio, with a focus on IQOS and proprietary HTUs like HEETS and Marlboro HeatSticks, aligned with the company's smoke-free future strategy.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, heat-not-burn products were reclassified under the broader 'smoke-free products' category, which also included e-vapor, oral nicotine, wellness, and healthcare products, and explicitly included licensed KT&G heat-not-burn products.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a shift from positioning heat-not-burn as a standalone RRP initiative to integrating it within a broader smoke-free and wellness-oriented product ecosystem, with expanded sourcing through licensing agreements."

We  are  a  leading  international  tobacco  company working to deliver a smoke-free future and evolving our portfolio for the long-term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector.  Our  current  product  portfolio  primarily  consists  of  cigarettes  and  reduced-risk  products,  including  heat-not-burn,  vapor  and  oral nicotine  products,  which  are  sold  in  markets  outside  the  United  States.  Since  2008,  we  have  invested  more  than  $9  billion  to  develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas  of  pre-clinical  systems  toxicology,  clinical  and  behavioral  research,  as  well  as  post-market  studies.  The  U.S.  Food  and  Drug Administration (\"FDA\") has authorized the marketing of a version of PMI's IQOS Platform 1 device and consumables as a Modified Risk Tobacco Product (\"MRTP\"), finding that an exposure modification order for these products is appropriate to promote the public health. We describe  the  MRTP  order  in  more  detail  in  the  \"Business  Environment\"  section  of  Item  7. Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life-sciences, in February 2021, we announced our ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and deliver innovative products and solutions that aim to address unmet patient and consumer needs.\n\nIn March 2008, we became a U.S. public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange and subject to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\").\n\nReduced-risk products (\"RRPs\") is the term we use to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less  risk  of  harm  to  smokers  who  switch  to  these  products  versus  continuing  to  smoke. We  have  a  range  of  RRPs  in  various  stages  of development,  scientific  assessment  and  commercialization.  Our  RRPs  are  smoke-free  products  that  contain  and/or  generate  far  lower quantities of harmful and potentially harmful constituents than found in cigarette smoke.\n\nOur IQOS smoke-free product brand portfolio includes heated tobacco and nicotine-containing vapor products.  Our leading smoke-free platform (\"Platform 1\") is a precisely controlled heating device into which a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol. Heated tobacco units (\"HTU\") is the term we use to refer to heated tobacco consumables, which include our HEETS , HEETS Creations, HEETS Dimensions, HEETS Marlboro and HEETS FROM MARLBORO ( defined collectively as \" HEETS\") , Marlboro  Dimensions , Marlboro HeatSticks,  Parliament  HeatSticks and TEREA, as  well  as  the  KT&amp;G-licensed  brands, Fiit and Miix (outside of South Korea). Platform 1 was first introduced in Nagoya, Japan, in 2014. As of December 31, 2021, our smoke-free products are available for sale in 71 markets in key cities or nationwide.\n\nOur cigarettes are sold in approximately 180 markets, and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position. We have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands. Our portfolio comprises both international and local brands and is led by Marlboro , the world's best-selling international cigarette, which accounted for approximately 38% of our total 2021 cigarette shipment volume. Marlboro is complemented in the premium-price category by Parliament . Our other leading international cigarette brands are Bond Street, Chesterfield, L&amp;M , Lark and Philip Morris. These seven international cigarette brands contributed approximately 79% of our cigarette shipment volume in 2021. We also own a number of important local cigarette brands, such as Dji Sam Soe and Sampoerna A in Indonesia, and Fortune and Jackpot in the Philippines.\n\nDuring  2021,  we  laid  the  foundation  for  our  long-term  growth  ambitions  beyond  nicotine  in  wellness  and  healthcare,  including  the milestone acquisitions of Vectura Group PLC and Fertin Pharma A/S, which provide essential capabilities for future product development.\n\n## Source of Funds - Dividends\n\nWe are a legal entity separate and distinct from our direct and indirect subsidiaries. Accordingly, our right, and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior rights of creditors of such subsidiary, except to the extent that claims of our company itself as a creditor may be recognized.

      "answer": "In 2022, PMI classified Reduced-Risk Products (RRPs) as a distinct category, including heated tobacco units, heat-not-burn devices, e-vapor, and oral nicotine products, with separate net revenue reporting. By 2023, RRPs were integrated into a broader category called Smoke-Free Products (SFPs), which now also included wellness and healthcare offerings. Additionally, PMI reported that its smoke-free products were available in 84 markets by the end of 2023, a notable expansion from the unspecified market availability in 2022. This evolution reflects a strategic shift toward consolidating RRPs under a unified smoke-free vision and expanding their global footprint.",

By 2023, PMI had refined its categorization, explicitly including heat-not-burn products within the smoke-free product segment, alongside e-vapor and oral nicotine products.

          "chunk_text": "## Background and Basis of Presentation:\n\n## Background\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. is a holding company incorporated in Virginia, U.S.A. (also referred to herein as the U.S., the United States or the United States of America), whose subsidiaries and affiliates and their licensees are primarily engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and reduced-risk products including heat-not-burn, vapor and oral nicotine products, in markets outside of the United States of America. In addition, during 2021, 2020 and 2019, PMI shipped versions of its Platform 1 device and its consumables authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") to Altria Group, Inc., for sale in the United States under license. For further developments related to the sale of these products in the U.S., see Note 17. Contingencies . Throughout these financial statements, the term \"PMI\" refers to Philip Morris International Inc. and its subsidiaries.\n\nReduced-risk products (\"RRPs\") is the term PMI uses to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less  risk  of  harm  to  smokers  who  switch  to  these  products  versus  continuing  smoking.    PMI  has  a  range  of  RRPs  in  various  stages  of development, scientific assessment and commercialization.\n\n\"Platform  1\"  is  the  term  PMI  uses  to  refer  to  PMI's  reduced-risk  product  that  uses  a  precisely  controlled  heating  device  into  which  a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol.\n\n## Basis of presentation\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  Significant  estimates  and  assumptions  include,  among  other  things:  pension  and  benefit  plan  assumptions;  useful  lives  and valuation  assumptions  of  goodwill  and  other  intangible  assets;  valuation  assumptions  for  non-marketable  equity  securities;  marketing programs, and income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include PMI, as well as its wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. Investments in which PMI exercises  significant  influence  (generally  20%-50%  ownership  interest)  are  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  of  accounting. Investments not accounted for under the equity method of accounting are measured at fair value, if it is readily determinable, with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Investments without readily determinable fair values, non-marketable equity securities, are measured and recorded using a measurement alternative that values the security at cost minus any impairment. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2021, the former Latin America &amp; Canada segment was renamed as the Americas segment. Additionally, due to the acquisitions of Fertin Pharma A/S, Vectura Group plc. and OtiTopic, Inc. in the third quarter of 2021, PMI added an Other category. For further details, see Note 6. Acquisitions and Note 12. Segment Reporting .\n\nAs of March 22, 2019, PMI deconsolidated the financial results of its Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. (\"RBH\") from PMI's financial statements. For further details, see Note 20. Deconsolidation of RBH .\n\nCertain prior years' amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year's presentation. The changes did not have a material impact on PMI's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in any of the periods presented.",

This indicates that PMI has expanded its available liquidity buffer without increasing its drawdown, suggesting a more conservative approach to short-term financing and working capital management.",

We do not, however, believe Brexit has had or will have a material impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\n\nFurthermore, the imposition of tariffs and/or increase in tariffs on various products by the United States and other countries have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to trade policies and government regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries and new and/or increased tariffs have subjected, and may continue in the future to subject, us to additional costs and expenditure of resources. Major developments in trade relations, including the imposition of new or increased tariffs by the United States and/or other countries, and any emerging nationalist trends in specific countries could alter the trade environment and consumer purchasing behavior which, in turn, could have a material effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nIn an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements, we engage in a combination of selling price increases, where permitted, sourcing strategies, cost-containment measures and selective hedging of foreign currency transactions. However, the impact of these measures may not fully offset any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n## Significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business.\n\nWe face vigorous competition worldwide, including from strong local competitors and from other large, multinational companies, some of which have greater resources than we do. In addition, the substantial growth in eCommerce has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models.\n\nWe face competition in several aspects of our business, including pricing, promotional activities, new product introductions and expansion into new geographies and channels. Some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on or have more effective advertising and promotional activities than we do, introduce competing products more quickly and/or respond more effectively to business and economic conditions and changing consumer preferences, including by launching innovative new products. Such competition also extends to administrative and legal challenges of product claims and advertising. Our success is increasingly dependent on our ability to effectively leverage digital technology and data analytics to gain new commercial insights and develop relevant marketing and advertising to reach customers and consumers. In addition, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced and may continue to experience elevated demand for some of our products as compared to pre-pandemic levels. Our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands and on our ability to enforce and defend our intellectual property, including patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and trade dress rights, against infringement and legal challenges by competitors.\n\nWe may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such initiatives or challenges by competitors or to successfully respond to them, which could harm our business. In addition, the cost of responding to such initiatives and challenges, including management time, out-of-pocket expenses and price reductions, may affect our performance. A failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n## Increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets, changes in the policies of our retail trade customers, the emergence of alternative retail channels and the rapidly changing retail landscape and changing consumer preferences may adversely affect our business.\n\nOur products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased trade concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers, discounters and eCommerce retailers. With the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation, the rapid growth of eCommerce and the integration of traditional and digital operations at key retailers, we are increasingly dependent on certain retailers, and some of these retailers have and may continue to have greater bargaining strength than we do. They have used and may continue to use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts, allowances, slotting fees or increased investment, including through display media, paid search, preparation fees and co-op programs, which have led to and could continue to lead to reduced sales or profitability in certain markets. The loss of a key customer or a significant reduction in sales to a key customer could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For additional information regarding our customers, see 'Distribution; Raw Materials; Competition; Trademarks and Patents' in Item 1 'Business.'\n\nWe also have been and may continue to be negatively affected by changes in the policies or practices of our retail trade customers, such as inventory de-stocking, fulfillment requirements, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products, or environmental, sustainability, supply chain or packaging standards or initiatives.

However, in 2023, the company indicated that approximately 10% of the cumulative pretax charges from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative would relate to initiatives undertaken in Africa/Eurasia, signaling a shift in focus toward restructuring and cost optimization in the region rather than continued capital investment. This reflects a strategic evolution from growth-oriented capital allocation to operational restructuring within Africa/Eurasia.",

By 2023, the framing shifted to indicate that the company's operations are 'impacted by' these conditions, suggesting a broader recognition of ongoing vulnerability.

If our existing or new suppliers fail to meet such standards or if we are unable to contract with suppliers on favorable terms, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\nWe believe that the supplies of raw and packaging materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate. In addition, we have business continuity and contingency plans in place for key manufacturing sites and contract manufacturers and the supply of raw and packaging materials. Nonetheless, a significant disruption to the manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials for any reason, including those mentioned above, have at times interrupted and could, in the future, interrupt product supply and, if not remedied, could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nIn addition, as a result of our global shared service organizational model, certain of our functions, such as finance and accounting, customer service and logistics, human resources, global information technology and data analytics are concentrated in key office facilities. A significant disruption to any of our key office facilities for any reason, including those mentioned above, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n## Volatility in material and other costs could adversely impact our profitability.\n\nRaw and packaging material commodities, such as essential oils, resins, tropical oils, pulp, tallow, corn, poultry and soybeans, are subject to market price variations. Increases in the costs of and/or a reduction in the availability of commodities, energy and logistics (including trucks and containers) and other necessary services, including during the COVID-19 pandemic, have affected and are likely to continue to adversely affect our profit margins. Inflationary pressures have also increased and may continue to increase the cost of such commodities and services. If commodity and other cost increases continue in the future and we are unable to pass along such higher costs in the form of price increases, achieve cost efficiencies, such as in manufacturing and distribution, or otherwise manage the exposure through sourcing strategies, ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely impacted. In addition, even if we are able to increase the prices of our products in response to commodity and other cost increases, we may not be able to sustain the price increases.

      "question": "How did Skoal's market position and competitive performance within Altria's oral tobacco products segment evolve between 2022 and 2024, particularly in relation to its key competitor brands?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Skoal was one of the premium oral tobacco brands under Altria, alongside Copenhagen and on!, with a retail share of 9.3%. By 2024, Skoal's retail share had declined to 7.6%, indicating a weakening market position. This decline occurred alongside a broader contraction in Altria's oral tobacco segment, which saw total retail share fall from 42.5% in 2023 to 37.5% in 2024. Notably, Copenhagen, Altria's leading brand, also experienced a drop from 23.5% to 19.1% over the same period, while on! oral nicotine pouches gained traction, rising from 6.8% to 8.3%. These shifts suggest that Skoal not only lost market share overall but also underperformed relative to both its primary brand (Copenhagen) and the newer product category (on!).",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n- Cigars: Middleton is engaged in the manufacture and sale of machine-made large cigars and pipe tobacco. Middleton contracts with a third-party importer to supply a majority of its cigars and sells substantially all of its cigars to customers in the United States. Black &amp; Mild is the principal cigar brand of Middleton. Total smokeable products segment's cigars shipment volume was approximately 1.8 billion units in 2021, essentially unchanged from 2020.\n- Oral tobacco products: USSTC is the leading producer and marketer of MST products. The oral tobacco products segment includes the premium brands, Copenhagen and Skoal , and value brand, Red Seal , sold by USSTC. In addition, the oral tobacco products segment includes on! oral nicotine pouches sold by Helix. Substantially all of the oral tobacco products are manufactured and sold to customers in the United States. Total oral tobacco products segment's shipment volume was 820.3 million units in 2021, essentially unchanged from 2020.\n- Innovative tobacco products: In December 2013, Altria's subsidiaries entered into a series of agreements with Philip Morris International Inc. ('PMI'), including an agreement that grants Altria an exclusive right to commercialize certain of PMI's heated tobacco products in the United States, subject to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's ('FDA') authorization of the applicable products. PMI submitted a pre-market tobacco product application ('PMTA') and modified risk tobacco product ('MRTP') application with the FDA for its electronically heated tobacco products, comprising the IQOS Tobacco Heating System . In 2019, based on FDA authorized PMTAs, PM USA began commercialization of the IQOS Tobacco Heating System in select markets.\n\nIn connection with a patent dispute, the U.S. International Trade Commission ('ITC') issued a limited exclusion order barring the importation of the IQOS devices, Marlboro HeatSticks and infringing components into the United States and a cease and desist order barring domestic sales, marketing and distribution of these imported products effective November 29, 2021. In December 2021, defendants appealed the orders to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Due to this litigation, PM USA removed the IQOS devices and Marlboro HeatSticks from the marketplace. PM USA does not expect to have access to IQOS devices or Marlboro HeatSticks in 2022. For a further discussion of the ITC decision, see Note 18. Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 ('Note 18').\n\nIn October 2021, the FDA authorized the marketing and sale of four of USSTC's Verve oral nicotine products, including Green Mint and Blue Mint varieties, representing the first flavored product authorizations issued by the FDA for newly deemed products. These products are not currently marketed or sold.\n\n- Distribution, Competition and Raw Materials: Altria's tobacco subsidiaries sell their tobacco products principally to wholesalers (including distributors) and large retail organizations, including chain stores.\n\nThe market for tobacco products is highly competitive, characterized by brand recognition and loyalty, with product quality, taste, price, product innovation, marketing, packaging and distribution constituting the significant methods of competition. Promotional activities include, in certain instances and where permitted by law, allowances, the distribution of incentive items, price promotions, product promotions, coupons and other discounts.\n\nThe Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act ('FSPTCA') provides the FDA with broad authority to regulate the design, manufacture, packaging, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of tobacco products; the authority to require disclosures of related information; and the authority to enforce the FSPTCA and related regulations.\n\nIn the United States, under a contract growing program, PM USA purchases the majority of its burley and flue-cured leaf tobaccos directly from domestic tobacco growers. Under the terms of this program, PM USA agrees to purchase the amount of tobacco specified in the grower contracts that meets PM USA's grade and quality standards. PM USA also purchases a portion of its tobacco requirements through leaf merchants.\n\nUSSTC purchases dark fire-cured, dark air-cured and burley leaf tobaccos from domestic tobacco growers under a contract growing program. Under the terms of this program, USSTC agrees to purchase the amount of tobacco specified in the grower contracts that meets USSTC's grade and quality standard.\n\nMiddleton purchases burley, dark air-cured and flue-cured leaf tobaccos through leaf merchants. Middleton does not have a contract growing program.\n\nAltria's tobacco subsidiaries believe there is an adequate supply of tobacco in the world markets to satisfy their current and anticipated production requirements.\n\nFor further discussion of the foregoing matters, the tobacco business environment, trends in market demand and competitive conditions, and related risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10-K ('Item 1A') and Tobacco Space - Business Environment in Item 7.\n\n## Financial Services Business\n\nIn 2003, PMCC ceased making new investments and began focusing exclusively on managing its portfolio of finance assets in order to maximize its operating results and cash flows from its existing lease portfolio activities and asset sales. Altria expects to complete the wind-down of this business by the end of 2022.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the goodwill allocated to smokeable products was $99 million, indicating a relatively small portion of MO's overall asset valuation, with total goodwill at $5,177 million. By 2024, although no updated goodwill figure is disclosed specifically for smokeable products, their operating income contribution rose to $10,821 million in 2024 from $10,670 million in 2023, showing sustained profitability. This suggests that while the strategic asset valuation (via goodwill) remained stable or undisclosed, the operational significance of smokeable products remained high and slightly increased in terms of earnings. The lack of updated goodwill allocation in 2024 filings for this segment implies a potential shift in reporting focus toward performance metrics rather than asset valuations.",

        "Step 1: Identify the 2022 goodwill allocation for smokeable products and its proportion of total goodwill.",

While the company maintained its $3.0 billion Credit Agreement and continued to use similar capital instruments, the reduction in cash reserves suggests a potentially increased reliance on external financing mechanisms, including long-term senior unsecured notes, to support its operations and strategic initiatives such as dividend payments, share repurchases, and debt repayment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 (2022) \u2014 Altria had $4.5 billion in cash and relied on long-term senior unsecured notes as part of its capital resources.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 (2024) \u2014 Altria still used long-term senior unsecured notes and maintained the same $3.0 billion credit facility, but its cash and cash equivalents dropped to $3.1 billion.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change \u2014 The decrease in cash reserves indicates a shift toward potentially greater reliance on long-term senior unsecured notes and other credit instruments to fund operations and strategic activities."

      "question": "How has the treatment of the 1992 Stock Plan evolved between the 2023 and 2024 10-K filings, particularly in terms of its role within the company's equity compensation structure?",
      "answer": "In the 2023 10-K filing, the 1992 Stock Plan was referenced as an adopted plan with specific terms and conditions incorporated by reference to prior filings. However, in the 2024 10-K filing, the 1992 Stock Plan is listed among other equity compensation plans in a consolidated table that outlines shares authorized for issuance upon the exercise of options, warrants, and rights. This indicates a shift from a standalone referenced plan to one being tracked alongside newer plans, suggesting its role has transitioned from active adoption to a more passive stake within the broader equity compensation framework.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2023, the 1992 Stock Plan was explicitly referenced as an adopted plan with its terms and conditions incorporated by reference to prior filings, indicating active recognition of its structure and governance.",
        "In 2024, the 1992 Stock Plan is no longer singled out but is instead listed among other equity compensation plans in a comprehensive table showing shares available for issuance, suggesting a diminished standalone role.",
        "The evolution reflects a shift from direct adoption and emphasis on the plan's terms to a more passive inclusion in a broader equity compensation structure, indicating a change in how the plan is utilized or perceived by the company over time."

        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 (2023) - P&G disclosed using forward contracts and currency swaps for hedging and stated that a near-term change in currency rates would not materially affect financial statements at a 95% confidence level.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 (2024) - P&G reiterated the same hedging instruments (forward contracts and currency swaps) and repeated the same assessment regarding the non-material impact of near-term currency rate changes at the same confidence level.",

We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting. We leverage the Company's diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize operational hedging activities over financial market instruments. To the extent we choose to further manage volatility within our financing operations, as discussed below, we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments.\n\nDerivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuation, sensitivity analysis and value-at-risk modeling. The tests for interest rate, currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the RiskManager\u2122 value-at-risk model using a one-year horizon and a 95% confidence level. The model incorporates the impact of correlation (the degree to which exposures move together over time) and diversification (from holding multiple currency, commodity and interest rate instruments) and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the RiskMetrics\u2122 dataset as of June 30, 2024. In cases where data is unavailable in RiskMetrics\u2122, a reasonable proxy is included.\n\nOur market risk exposures relative to interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, as discussed below, have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period. In addition, we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly impact such exposures in the near term.\n\nInterest Rate Exposure. We are exposed to interest rate movements due to our long and short-term borrowing program. Interest rate swaps are used to manage exposures to interest rates on underlying debt obligations. Certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on our investments in foreign operations. These currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the Company's foreign net investments.\n\nBased on our interest rate exposure as of and during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates, we believe  a  near-term  change  in  interest  rates,  at  a  95%  confidence  level  based  on  historical  interest  rate  movements,  would  not  materially  affect  our  financial statements.\n\nCurrency Rate Exposure. Because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world, we are exposed to movements in currency exchange rates. We leverage the Company's diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge. Corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity. To manage the exchange rate risk associated with the financing of our operations, we primarily use forward contracts and currency swaps with maturities of less than 18 months.\n\nBased on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, we believe, at a 95% confidence level based on historical currency rate movements, the impact on such instruments of a near-term change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements.\n\nCommodity Price Exposure. We use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. We may use futures, options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not have any financial commodity hedging activity.\n\n## Measures Not Defined By U.S. GAAP\n\nIn accordance with the SEC's Regulation S-K Item 10(e), the following provides definitions of non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measure. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business trends (i.e., trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results  and  provide  a  supplemental  measure  of  year-on-year  results.  The  non-G AAP  measures  described  below  are  used  by  management  in  making  operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors, as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors with a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-",

      "answer": "In 2022, MDLZ reported a decrease in Canadian notes of $3 million, continuing a trend of declining balances from $17 million in 2019 to $7 million in 2020 and $3 million in 2021. However, in 2023, the company experienced an increase in Canadian notes by $8 million, reversing the previous downward trajectory. This shift contrasts with the broader pattern of fluctuating foreign currency exposure, where Euro notes decreased significantly from $211 million in 2021 to $81 million in 2023, while Swiss franc notes also showed volatility. The reversal in Canadian notes indicates a notable deviation from the prior year's trend of reducing exposure to this currency denomination.",

        "Step 1: Identify the state of Canadian notes in 2022, which showed a decrease of $3 million, continuing a multi-year downward trend.",

        "Step 3: Analyze the change as a shift in MDLZ's foreign currency exposure strategy, particularly in contrast to the broader pattern of fluctuating debt levels across other currencies like the Euro and Swiss franc."

      "question": "How has Walmart's exposure to increases in drug prices as a risk factor evolved between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of its pharmacy operations and contractual relationships with third-party payers?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Walmart identified 'increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic prescription drugs we sell' as a key risk factor that could affect pharmacy net sales and gross margin. By 2023, this risk remained prominent but was more specifically tied to broader contractual and reimbursement dynamics, including changes in third-party payer drug formularies and participation in exclusive or preferred pharmacy network arrangements operated by PBMs. While the core risk of drug price increases persisted, Walmart expanded its framing to include more strategic dependencies, such as its 10-year collaboration with UnitedHealth Group and the role of value-based care in mitigating some pressures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Walmart explicitly listed increases in drug prices as a risk factor affecting pharmacy operations, gross margin, and net sales.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the company maintained the drug price increase risk but added context around evolving contractual relationships, including formulary changes and network arrangements with PBMs, as well as new strategic partnerships like the one with UnitedHealth Group.",
        "Step 3: The evolution shows that while the fundamental risk of rising drug prices remained, Walmart's exposure became more nuanced, incorporating broader structural dependencies and strategic responses."

These products and services require us to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, including global anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and regulations as well as international, federal and state consumer financial laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, sanctions, penalties and harm to our reputation.\n\nThe Company also has compliance obligations associated with privacy laws enacted to protect and regulate the collection, use, retention, disclosure and transfer of personal information, which include liability for security and privacy breaches. Among other obligations, breaches may trigger obligations under federal and state laws to notify affected individuals, government agencies and the media. Consequently, cybersecurity attacks that cause a data breach could subject us to fines, sanctions and other legal liability and harm our reputation.\n\n## Changes in the results of our health and wellness business could adversely affect our overall results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\nWalmart has retail pharmacy operations in our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments, as well as the recent addition of Walmart Health locations in a number of states which offer medical, dental, optometry, immunizations, and other health services. A large majority of our retail pharmacy net sales are generated by filling prescriptions for which we receive payment through established contractual relationships with third-party payers and payment administrators, such as private insurers, governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers (\"PBMs\").\n\nThese operations are subject to numerous risks, including: reductions in the third-party reimbursement rates for drugs; changes in our payer mix (i.e., shifts in the relative distribution of our pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less favorable reimbursement terms); changes in third-party payer drug formularies (i.e., the schedule of prescription drugs approved for reimbursement or which otherwise receive preferential coverage treatment); growth in, and our participation in or exclusion from, pharmacy payer network arrangements including exclusive and preferred pharmacy network arrangements operated by PBMs and/or any insurance plan or program; increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic prescription drugs we sell; increases in the administrative burdens associated with seeking third-party reimbursement; changes in the frequency with which new brand name pharmaceuticals become available to consumers; introduction of lower cost generic drugs as substitutes for existing brand name drugs for which there was no prior generic drug competition; changes in drug mix (i.e., the relative distribution of drugs customers purchase at our pharmacies between brands and generics); changes in the health insurance market generally; changes in the scope of or the elimination of Medicare Part D or Medicaid drug programs; increased competition from other retail pharmacy operations including competitors offering online retail pharmacy options with or without home delivery options; further consolidation and strategic alliances among third-party payers, PBMs or purchasers of drugs; overall economic conditions and the ability of our pharmacy customers to pay for drugs prescribed for them to the extent the costs are not reimbursed by a third-party; failure to meet any performance or incentive thresholds to which our level of third-party reimbursement may be subject; changes in laws or regulations or the practices of third-party payers and PBMs related to the use of third-party financial assistance to assist our pharmacy customers with paying for drugs prescribed for them; and any additional changes in the regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industry and the pharmaceutical industry, including as a result of restrictions on the further implementation of or the repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or the enactment and implementation of a law replacing such act, and other changes in laws, rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business.\n\nIf the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of our vendors were to be disrupted for any reason, our pharmacy operations could be severely affected until at least such time as we could obtain a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals. Any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a significant number of our pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies.\n\nOne or a combination of such factors may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell, our cost of sales associated with our retail pharmacy operations, and the net sales and gross margin of those operations or result in the loss of cross-store or cross-club selling opportunities and, in turn, adversely affect our overall net sales, other results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\n## Our failure to attract and retain qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes in laws and other labor issues could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nOur ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates globally. Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs, distribution and fulfillment centers and corporate offices, while",

      "answer": "In the 2023 10-K filing, Sanex was listed among Colgate-Palmolive\u2019s principal global and regional trademarks alongside brands such as Colgate, Palmolive, and Tom's of Maine. In the 2024 filing, Sanex remained on the list, but the surrounding language was slightly revised, with the phrase 'global and regional' replaced by 'global and regional trademarks' without the earlier elaboration. While Sanex was still explicitly named, the more streamlined presentation in 2024 may indicate a subtle shift in brand emphasis or a simplification of brand portfolio communication, though no explicit statement regarding Sanex's strategic role or financial performance was provided in either year.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2023, Sanex was included in the list of 'principal global and regional trademarks' within the Nature of Operations section, suggesting its recognition as a notable brand within the company\u2019s portfolio.",
        "In 2024, Sanex remained listed in the same section, but the surrounding phrasing was simplified, removing the phrase 'global and regional' before 'trademarks' and streamlining the overall description of the brand portfolio.",
        "The continued presence of Sanex in the list indicates it remains a trademarked brand of Colgate-Palmolive, but the change in presentation suggests a possible shift in how the brand is positioned or described strategically, though no specific financial or operational changes were disclosed."

      "answer": "In 2023, Filorga was treated as a standalone reporting unit within the Europe segment with a clearly disclosed goodwill carrying value of $221 million, indicating its distinct financial significance and the company\u2019s detailed impairment analysis for this brand. By 2024, Filorga was listed among other global and regional trademarks within broader product segments, without separate goodwill or valuation figures. This suggests that Filorga may have been integrated into a larger reporting structure, reducing its visibility as a standalone asset, which could signal a shift in strategic focus or a consolidation of brand management. This change affects how Filorga\u2019s valuation and performance are assessed, potentially influencing future strategic decisions such as divestiture, investment, or brand prioritization.",

      "answer": "In both the 2023 and 2024 10-K filings, Colgate-Palmolive includes Softsoap among its principal global and regional trademarks within the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment. However, in the 2023 filing, Softsoap is mentioned in the context of being 'disclosed' as part of the company's trademark portfolio, while in 2024, the language shifts to indicate that Softsoap is explicitly 'produced' as part of the company's product offerings. This evolution suggests a subtle but meaningful shift in how Softsoap is positioned \u2014 from being a disclosed brand asset to being directly tied to the company's manufacturing and marketing activities. Although no specific revenue figures or product classification changes are provided for Softsoap in either year, the change in terminology indicates a potentially stronger strategic emphasis on the brand's operational role within the company's product portfolio.",

        "Step 1: In the 2023 filing, Softsoap is listed among principal trademarks and described in the context of being disclosed as part of the company's broader brand portfolio.",

        "Step 3: The shift from 'disclosed' to 'produced' indicates a change in how the Softsoap brand is framed \u2014 from a passive listing as part of the trademark portfolio to an active product the company is directly responsible for producing."

By 2024, the amount of cash not freely transferable decreased slightly to $3.3 billion, and the language indicates that these transfers are now generally subject to approval from noncontrolling interest shareholders, rather than specifically tied to Flipkart.

          "chunk_text": "## Walmart Inc.\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## General\n\nWalmart Inc. (\"Walmart\" or the \"Company\") helps people around the world save money and live better - anytime and anywhere by providing the opportunity to shop in both retail stores and through eCommerce. Through innovation, the Company is striving to continuously improve a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel offering that saves time for its customers.\n\nThe Company's operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Walmart and its subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022 (\"fiscal 2022\"), January 31, 2021 (\"fiscal 2021\") and January 31, 2020 (\"fiscal 2020\"). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. The Company consolidates variable interest entities where it has been determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of those entities' operations. Investments for which the Company exercises significant influence but does not have control are accounted for under the equity method. These variable interest entities and equity method investments are immaterial to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending on January 31 for the United States (\"U.S.\") and Canadian operations. The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during the month of January 2022 related to the operations consolidated using a lag that materially affected the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nThe Company considers investments with a maturity when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents. All credit card, debit card and electronic transfer transactions that process in less than seven days are classified as cash and cash equivalents. The amounts due from banks for these transactions classified as cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.7 billion and $4.1 billion as of January 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nThe Company's cash balances are held in various locations around the world. Of the Company's $14.8 billion and $17.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of January 31, 2022 and January 31, 2021, approximately 50% and 40% were held outside of the U.S., respectively.

The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2024, when compared to the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to higher cash provided by operating income, as well as timing of certain payments and strategic inventory management as part of working capital initiatives, partially offset by payment of the remaining accrued opioid legal charges.\n\n## Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $9.0 billion and $9.9 billion as of January 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

      "answer": "In 2022, Walmart received $3.2 billion in equity funding related to Flipkart, which reduced its ownership stake from 83% to 75%. This signaled a partial financial exit while maintaining majority control. By 2024, however, Walmart disclosed ongoing regulatory scrutiny in India, including a show cause notice issued in July 2021 and subsequent information requests related to alleged violations of India's Foreign Direct Investment rules during the period 2009\u20132015\u2014prior to Walmart's acquisition of Flipkart in 2018. Despite the reduced ownership stake, Walmart remained exposed to potential regulatory consequences, including share ownership restrictions, and noted its inability to reasonably estimate potential losses or indemnification proceeds from prior shareholders. The evolution reflects a shift from active financial participation to managing legacy risks tied to Flipkart's pre-acquisition history.",

On December 23, 2024, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\"CFPB\") filed a lawsuit against the Company and Branch Messenger, Inc. in the District of Minnesota alleging the Company violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act by allegedly requiring independent contractor drivers on the Spark platform to receive payments through a financial product offered by Branch.

On October 6, 2023, the Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Competencia Econ\u00f3mica of M\u00e9xico (\"COFECE\") notified the main Mexican operating subsidiary of Wal-Mart de M\u00e9xico, S.A.B. de C.V. (\"Walmex\"), a majority owned subsidiary of the Company, that COFECE's Investigatory Authority (\"IA\") had recommended the initiation of a quasi-judicial administrative process against Walmex's subsidiary for alleged relative monopolistic practices in connection with the supply and wholesale distribution of certain consumer goods, retail marketing practices of such consumer goods and related services. On December 12, 2024, after Walmex provided defenses, produced expert evidence and participated in a hearing, COFECE issued a split decision that Walmex's subsidiary had engaged in a single relative monopolistic practice in relation to the negotiation of two types of contributions with its suppliers. The resolution imposed a monetary penalty on Walmex's subsidiary in the amount of $93.4 million pesos (approximately $5 million U.S. dollars) and certain non-structural conduct measures relating to the two prohibited types of supplier contributions (while recognizing that other supplier contributions can continue). On January 6, 2025, Walmex's subsidiary challenged COFECE's resolution through an appeal in the specialized federal courts. Until the appeal is resolved, Walmex's subsidiary will operate in compliance with COFECE's ruling. Payment of the monetary penalty is stayed until the lawsuit is resolved.\n\nForeign Direct Investment Matters. In July 2021, the Directorate of Enforcement in India issued a show cause notice to Flipkart Private Limited and one of its subsidiaries (\"Flipkart\"), and to unrelated companies and individuals, including certain current and former shareholders and directors of Flipkart. The notice requests the recipients to show cause as to why further proceedings under India's Foreign Direct Investment rules and regulations (the \"Rules\") should not be initiated against them based on alleged violations during the period from 2009 to 2015, prior to the Company's acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart in 2018 (the \"Notice\"), in addition to more recent requests for information from the Directorate of Enforcement to Flipkart for periods prior and subsequent to April 2016 regarding the Rules, including the most recent request in February 2025 (the \"Requests\"). The Notice is an initial stage of proceedings under the Rules which could, depending upon the conclusions at the end of the initial stage, lead to a hearing to consider the merits of the allegations described in the Notice. If a hearing is initiated, whether with respect to the Notice or from further proceedings related to the Requests, and if it is determined that violations of the Rules occurred, then the regulatory authority has the authority to impose monetary and/or non-monetary relief, such as share ownership restrictions. Flipkart has been responding to the Notice and, if the matter progresses to a consideration of the merits of the allegations described in the Notice, Flipkart intends to defend against the allegations vigorously. Due to the fact that the process regarding the Notice is in the early stages, the Company is unable to predict whether the Notice will lead to a hearing on the merits or, if it does, the final outcome of the resulting proceedings, as well as whether any further proceedings will arise with respect to the Requests. The Company cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters and can provide no assurance as to the scope or outcome of any proceeding that might result from the Notice or the Requests, or the amount of the proceeds the Company may receive in indemnification from individuals and entities that sold shares to the Company under the 2018 agreement for the period prior to the date the Company acquired its majority stake in Flipkart, and further can provide no assurance that its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected.",

Higher interest rates, lower or higher prices of petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel, higher costs for electricity and other energy, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, increased costs of essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes or other changes in tax laws, changes in healthcare laws, other regulatory changes, the imposition of tariffs or other measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, overall economic slowdown or recession and other economic factors in the U.S. or in any of the other markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell in the U.S. or such other markets, change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods, adversely affect our net sales and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory, or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results and could result in impairment charges to intangible assets, goodwill or other long-lived assets.\n\nIn addition, the economic factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation, labor, insurance or healthcare costs or commodity prices, and other economic factors in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses and otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results.\n\nThe economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers, which can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale.\n\n## The performance of strategic alliances and other business relationships to support the expansion of our business could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nWe may enter into strategic alliances and other business relationships in the countries in which we have existing operations or in other markets to expand our business.

Negative reputational incidents or negative perceptions of us could adversely impact our business and results of operations, including through lower sales, the termination of business relationships and negative impacts to associate retention and recruiting efforts. Moreover, failure to adequately predict customer demand and consumer spending patterns or otherwise optimize and operate our distribution and fulfillment centers could result in excess or insufficient inventory, service interruptions and increased costs, any of which could significantly harm our business. As we continue to add new fulfillment centers, our fulfillment and technology networks become increasingly complex and operating them in a way that effectively meets consumer demands continues to be challenging. There can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively.\n\n## We face strong competition from other retailers, wholesale club operators, omni-channel retailers and other businesses which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nEach of our segments competes for customers, employees, digital prominence, products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional, national and global physical, eCommerce and omni-channel retailers, social commerce platforms, wholesale club operators and retail intermediaries, as well as companies that offer services in digital advertising, data analytics/insights, fulfillment and delivery services, health and wellness and financial services. The omni-channel retail landscape is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and the entry of new, well-funded competitors may increase competitive pressures. In addition, for eCommerce and other internet-based businesses, newer or smaller businesses may be better able to innovate and compete with us.\n\nWe compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms, quality and accessibility of data for customers, suppliers, and associates, and cost, speed of and options for accurate delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical and digital operations.\n\nA failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail and other markets in which we operate, omni-channel innovations and omnichannel ecosystems developed by our competitors or delays or failure in execution of our strategy could materially adversely affect our financial performance. See \"Item 1. Business\" above for additional discussion of the competitive situation of each of our reportable segments.\n\nCertain segments of the retail industry are undergoing consolidation or substantially reducing operations, whether due to bankruptcy, economics or other factors. Such consolidation, or other business combinations or alliances, competitive omni-channel ecosystems or reductions in operations may result in competitors with improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration and other improvements in their competitive positions.
