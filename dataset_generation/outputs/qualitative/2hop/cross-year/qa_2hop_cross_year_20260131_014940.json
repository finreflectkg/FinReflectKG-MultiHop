Firefly-powered generative AI features are also available in a number of our products including Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Express, Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Stock. Firefly is available for free with a limited number of G enerative Credits per month. Once that limit is reached, users and subscribers can buy additional Generative Credits through a Firefly paid subscription plan.\n\nAlso available for enterprises are Adobe Firefly Services and Custom Models. Firefly Services provides enterprises with APIs, tools and services for content generation, editing and assembly, to automate the production of content while maintaining quality and control. Custom Models enable enterprises to train generative AI models based on their intellectual property, product and brand styles across a wide variety of use cases such as localization or merchandising for e-commerce, maintaining and propagating brand consistency at scale across their organizations.\n\nAdobe Firefly-generated content is designed to be commercially safe. The Firefly generative AI model is trained on data Adobe has the rights to use. Every asset created using Firefly includes Content Credentials, a digital 'nutrition label', to indicate that generative AI was used, bringing more trust and transparency to digital content.\n\n## Adobe Stock\n\nAdobe Stock provides designers and businesses with access to millions of high-quality, curated, royalty-free photos, vectors, illustrations, videos, templates, audio and 3D assets, for all their creative projects. Adobe Stock is built into our  Creative  Cloud Apps, including Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign and Adobe Express, enabling users to search, browse and add assets to their Creative Cloud Libraries and instantly access them across all connected surfaces.

Frame.io is directly integrated with Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe After Effects, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Lightroom and Adobe Workfront to allow video creators to request and receive streamlined frame-specific comments directly in those Apps.  Frame.io's  Camera to  Cloud functionality allows creators to automatically upload footage from cameras and other recording devices on set directly into Frame.io for review, with integrations for still image cameras that can connect natively to the platform. Frame.io, along with Adobe Express and Adobe Firefly Services, are available in Adobe G enStudio to enable content production at scale.\n\n## Adobe Substance 3D Collection\n\nAdobe Substance 3D is an ecosystem of desktop Apps, including Substance 3D Stager, Substance 3D Painter, Substance 3D Sampler, Substance 3D Designer and Substance 3D Modeler.

Substance 3D Assets is a 3D materials library from which users can import professional quality 3D textures into their projects and generate infinite tex ture variations. Substance 3D Modeler, which is available on desktop and certain VR headsets, interprets spatial input from the physical world, allowing the user to sculpt a model as if in a real workshop, using natural, fluid gestures of the artistic flow, and switch between VR and desktop, at every project stage.\n\n## Behance\n\nBehance is a social community for creators to showcase and discover creative work online and live-stream their skills and creations from Creative Cloud Apps.

      "answer": "In 2023, the Firefly Vector Model was integrated into Adobe Express, enabling users to generate custom images and text effects from text prompts in over 100 languages. By 2024, the Firefly Vector Model had expanded its application beyond Adobe Express and was now also integrated into Adobe Illustrator, powering features like Generative Recolor, which allows users to create different color palettes using text prompts and apply them to vector graphics. This represents a significant expansion of the Firefly Vector Model\u2019s functionality and reach within Adobe\u2019s creative tools, moving from a single-app integration to becoming a core AI-driven feature across multiple professional-grade applications.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS\n\nAs previously discussed, our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Below we discuss some of the factors that could cause these differences. The occurrence of these and many other factors described in this report, and factors that we do not presently know or that we currently believe to be immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our operations, performance and financial condition. Many factors affect more than one category and the factors are not in order of significance or probability of occurrence because they have been grouped by categories.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our Business\n\n## We may be unsuccessful at innovating in response to rapid technological or industry changes to meet customer needs, which could cause our operating results to suffer.\n\nWe operate in rapidly evolving industries and expect the pace of innovation to continue to accelerate. We must continually introduce new, and enhance existing, products, services and solutions to retain customers and attract new customers. Developing new products, services and solutions is complex, requires significant investment and operational costs and may not be profitable, and our investments in new technologies are speculative and may not yield the expected business or financial benefits. The commercial success of new or enhanced products, services and solutions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development; effective distribution and marketing; market acceptance; compatibility with existing and emerging standards, platforms, software delivery methods and technologies; accurately predicting and anticipating customer needs and expectations and the direction of technological change; identifying and innovating in the right technologies; and differentiation from other products, services and solutions. If we fail to anticipate or identify technological, creative or marketing  trends  or  fail  to  devote  appropriate  resources  to  adapt  to  such  trends,  our  business  could  be  harmed.  For  ex ample,  generative  artificial  intelligence technologies enable users of all skill levels to create and provide new ways of marketing, creating content and interacting with documents, which could significantly disrupt industries in which we operate and our existing products, services and solutions and our business may be harmed if we fail to invest or adapt. While we have released new generative artificial intelligence products, such as Adobe Firefly, and are focused on enhancing the artificial intelligence ('AI') capabilities of our products and incorporating AI across existing products, services and solutions, there can be no assurance that our new or enhanced products and AI innovations will  be  successful,  adopted  or  monetizable  or  that  we  will  innovate  effectively  to  keep  pace  with  the  rapid  evolution  of AI  across  our  offerings.  If  we  do  not successfully innovate, adapt to rapid technological or industry changes and meet customer needs, our business and our financial results may be harmed.\n\n## Issues relating to the development and use of AI, including generative AI, in our offerings may result in reputational harm, liability and adverse financial results.\n\nSocial, ethical and operational issues relating to the use of AI, including generative AI, in our offerings may result in reputational harm, liability and additional costs. We are increasingly incorporating AI technologies, developed by us and by third parties, into many of our offerings. If our AI development, deployment, content labeling or governance is ineffective or inadequate, it may result in incidents that impair the public acceptance of AI solutions or cause harm to individuals, customers or society, or result in our offerings not working as intended or producing unexpected outcomes.\n\nJurisdictions around the world are developing and passing new regulations that apply specifically to the use of AI. For example, the EU AI Act was adopted in 2024 and will be implemented in phases through 2030, and other jurisdictions are considering similarly focused legislation. These regulations and the evolving AI regulatory environment may, among other impacts, result in inconsistencies among AI regulations and frameworks across jurisdictions, increase our compliance, governance and research and development costs, increase our exposure to claims related to our AI models and increase liability related to the use of AI by our customers or users that are beyond our control. While we have taken a responsible approach to the development and use of AI, such as in our Adobe Firefly offerings, there can be no guarantee that future AI regulations will not adversely impact us or conflict with our approach to AI, including affecting our ability to make our  AI  offerings  available  without  costly  changes,  delaying  or  halting  development  of  AI  offerings,  requiring  us  to  change  our  AI  development  practices, monetization strategies and/or indemnity protections and subjecting us to additional compliance requirements, regulatory action, competitive harm, reputational harm and/or legal liability. To the ex tent we rely on third-party AI models in our products, services and solutions, we will face risks inherent in how those models have been developed and deployed, including situations in which the third party may lack a proper license or consent for the training data used for their model. In addition, new competition regulations on AI development and deployment could impose new requirements on our markets that could impact our business and financial results.\n\nUncertainty around new and evolving AI uses may require significant, additional investment to develop models and proprietary datasets, responsible-use frameworks and new approaches and processes to attribute or compensate content creators. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, challenges accessing AI models, datasets or hardware. Developing, testing and deploying AI systems may also increase the cost of our offerings, including due to the nature of the computing costs",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS\n\nAs previously discussed, our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Below we discuss some of the factors that could cause these differences. The occurrence of these and many other factors described in this report, and factors that we do not presently know or that we currently believe to be immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our operations, performance and financial condition. Many factors affect more than one category and the factors are not in order of significance or probability of occurrence because they have been grouped by categories.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our Business\n\n## We may be unsuccessful at innovating in response to rapid technological or industry changes to meet customer needs, which could cause our operating results to suffer.\n\nWe operate in rapidly evolving industries and expect the pace of innovation to continue to accelerate. We must continually introduce new, and enhance existing, products, services and solutions to retain customers and attract new customers. Developing new products, services and solutions is complex, requires significant investment and operational costs and may not be profitable, and our investments in new technologies are speculative and may not yield the expected business or financial benefits. The commercial success of new or enhanced products, services and solutions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development; effective distribution and marketing; market acceptance; compatibility with existing and emerging standards, platforms, software delivery methods and technologies; accurately predicting and anticipating customer needs and expectations and the direction of technological change; identifying and innovating in the right technologies; and differentiation from other products, services and solutions. If we fail to anticipate or identify technological, creative or marketing  trends  or  fail  to  devote  appropriate  resources  to  adapt  to  such  trends,  our  business  could  be  harmed.  For  ex ample,  generative  artificial  intelligence technologies enable users of all skill levels to create and provide new ways of marketing, creating content and interacting with documents, which could significantly disrupt industries in which we operate and our existing products, services and solutions and our business may be harmed if we fail to invest or adapt. While we have released new generative artificial intelligence products, such as Adobe Firefly, and are focused on enhancing the artificial intelligence ('AI') capabilities of our products and incorporating AI across existing products, services and solutions, there can be no assurance that our new or enhanced products and AI innovations will  be  successful,  adopted  or  monetizable  or  that  we  will  innovate  effectively  to  keep  pace  with  the  rapid  evolution  of AI  across  our  offerings.  If  we  do  not successfully innovate, adapt to rapid technological or industry changes and meet customer needs, our business and our financial results may be harmed.\n\n## Issues relating to the development and use of AI, including generative AI, in our offerings may result in reputational harm, liability and adverse financial results.\n\nSocial, ethical and operational issues relating to the use of AI, including generative AI, in our offerings may result in reputational harm, liability and additional costs. We are increasingly incorporating AI technologies, developed by us and by third parties, into many of our offerings. If our AI development, deployment, content labeling or governance is ineffective or inadequate, it may result in incidents that impair the public acceptance of AI solutions or cause harm to individuals, customers or society, or result in our offerings not working as intended or producing unexpected outcomes.\n\nJurisdictions around the world are developing and passing new regulations that apply specifically to the use of AI. For example, the EU AI Act was adopted in 2024 and will be implemented in phases through 2030, and other jurisdictions are considering similarly focused legislation. These regulations and the evolving AI regulatory environment may, among other impacts, result in inconsistencies among AI regulations and frameworks across jurisdictions, increase our compliance, governance and research and development costs, increase our exposure to claims related to our AI models and increase liability related to the use of AI by our customers or users that are beyond our control. While we have taken a responsible approach to the development and use of AI, such as in our Adobe Firefly offerings, there can be no guarantee that future AI regulations will not adversely impact us or conflict with our approach to AI, including affecting our ability to make our  AI  offerings  available  without  costly  changes,  delaying  or  halting  development  of  AI  offerings,  requiring  us  to  change  our  AI  development  practices, monetization strategies and/or indemnity protections and subjecting us to additional compliance requirements, regulatory action, competitive harm, reputational harm and/or legal liability. To the ex tent we rely on third-party AI models in our products, services and solutions, we will face risks inherent in how those models have been developed and deployed, including situations in which the third party may lack a proper license or consent for the training data used for their model. In addition, new competition regulations on AI development and deployment could impose new requirements on our markets that could impact our business and financial results.\n\nUncertainty around new and evolving AI uses may require significant, additional investment to develop models and proprietary datasets, responsible-use frameworks and new approaches and processes to attribute or compensate content creators. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, challenges accessing AI models, datasets or hardware. Developing, testing and deploying AI systems may also increase the cost of our offerings, including due to the nature of the computing costs",

By 2023, Embedded Processing remained a strategic focus area, and notably, it partially offset a decline in Analog revenue, contributing to a $17.52 billion total revenue. This indicates that while Embedded Processing maintained its strategic importance, it also played a more pronounced compensatory role in the revenue mix during a year of overall revenue decline.",

Description of business, including segment and geographic area information\n\nWe design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. We have two reportable segments, Analog and Embedded Processing, each of which represents groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels.\n\n- Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by converting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. Our Analog segment consists of two major product lines: Power and Signal Chain.\n- Embedded Processing products are the digital 'brains' of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application.\n\nWe report the results of our remaining business activities in Other. Other includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other includes DLP  products, calculators and custom ASIC products. \u00ae\n\nIn Other, we also include items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. Examples of these items include acquisition, integration and restructuring charges (see Note 11); and certain corporate-level items, such as litigation expenses, environmental costs, insurance settlements, and gains and losses from other activities, including asset dispositions. We allocate the remainder of our expenses associated with corporate activities to our operating segments based on specific methodologies, such as percentage of operating expenses or headcount.\n\nOur centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, provide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments' results and, therefore, is not provided.\n\nWith the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, nor does the chief operating decision maker evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. We have no material intersegment revenue. The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in the summary of significant accounting policies and practices.",

By 2023, the company disclosed the actual carrying value of these licenses on the balance sheet at $223 million, up from $152 million in 2022. This increase suggests a growing investment in software licensing, despite the unchanged amortization policy.

          "chunk_text": "- Other long-term assets - Long-term investments, which are included within other long-term assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, consist of mutual funds, venture capital funds and non-marketable equity securities.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. Cost is generally computed on a currently adjusted standard cost basis, which approximates cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Standard cost is based on the normal utilization of installed factory capacity. Cost associated with underutilization of capacity is expensed as incurred. Inventory held at consignment locations is included in our finished goods inventory.\n\nWe review inventory quarterly for salability and obsolescence. A statistical allowance is provided for inventory considered unlikely to be sold. The statistical allowance is based on an analysis of historical disposal activity, historical customer shipments, as well as estimated future sales. A specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance. We write off inventory in the period in which disposal occurs.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment; acquisition-related intangibles; and other capitalized costs\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Our cost basis includes certain assets acquired in business combinations that were initially recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements. We amortize acquisition-related intangibles on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the assets. Capitalized software licenses generally are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the license. Fully depreciated or amortized assets are written off against accumulated depreciation or amortization.\n\n## Impairments of long-lived assets\n\nWe regularly review whether facts or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying values of property, plant and equipment or other long-lived assets, including intangible assets, are impaired. We assess the recoverability of assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with those assets to their respective carrying amounts. Any impairment charge is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. Fair value is determined by available market valuations, if applicable, or by discounted cash flows.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise. We perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, including goodwill. If, as a result of the qualitative assessment, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. See Note 11 for additional information.\n\n## Foreign currency\n\nThe functional currency for our non-U.S. subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Accounts recorded in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are remeasured into the functional currency. Current assets (except inventories), deferred taxes, other longterm assets, current liabilities and long-term liabilities are remeasured at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. Property, plant and equipment with associated depreciation and inventories are valued at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expense accounts other than depreciation for each month are calculated at the appropriate daily rate of exchange. Currency exchange gains and losses from remeasurement are credited or charged to OI&amp;E.\n\n## Derivatives and hedging\n\nWe use derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to foreign exchange risk. These instruments are primarily forward foreign currency exchange contracts, which are used as economic hedges to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuations may have on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. Gains and losses from changes in the fair value of these forward foreign currency exchange contracts are credited or charged to OI&amp;E. We do not apply hedge accounting to our foreign currency derivative instruments.\n\nWe are exposed to variability in compensation charges related to certain deferred compensation obligations to employees. We use total return swaps to economically hedge this exposure and offset the related compensation expense, recognizing changes in the value of the swaps and the related deferred compensation liabilities in SG&amp;A.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Analog Products were central to TI's strategic focus, contributing to a gross margin of 67.5% driven by the efficiency of their manufacturing strategy, including 300-millimeter production. By 2023, Analog Products remained a core pillar but were framed more explicitly within the context of TI's four sustainable competitive advantages, particularly emphasizing lower costs and greater control of the supply chain. Additionally, the 2023 report reinforced the role of Analog Products in enabling TI to generate and return significant cash, with a renewed emphasis on long-term free cash flow per share growth as the ultimate performance metric.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, TI's strategic focus was on analog and embedded processing products, with gross margin at 67.5%, attributed to manufacturing efficiency and 300mm production.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, Analog Products were positioned as part of a broader competitive advantage framework, specifically tied to cost leadership, supply chain control, and long-term cash flow generation.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a shift from a product-centric strategic emphasis to a more integrated view of how Analog Products contribute to TI's sustainable competitive advantages and capital return model."

          "chunk_text": "- Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed. When factory loadings decrease, our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins decrease. Conversely, as factory loadings increase, our fixed costs are spread over increased output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins increase.\n- For an explanation of free cash flow and the term 'annual operating tax rate,' see the Non-GAAP financial information section.\n- All dollar amounts in the tables are stated in millions of U.S. dollars.\n\nOur results of operations provides details of our financial results for 2021 and 2020 and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussion of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in 'Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations' in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and its effects are impacting and will likely continue to impact market conditions and business operations across industries worldwide, including at TI. Therefore, we remain cautious about how the economy might behave for the next few years and continue to monitor potential impact on our operations.\n\n## Results of operations\n\nOur strategic focus is on analog and embedded processing products sold into six end markets: industrial, automotive, personal electronics, communications equipment, enterprise systems and other. While all end markets represent good opportunities, we place additional strategic emphasis on designing and selling those products into the industrial and automotive markets, which we believe represent the best growth opportunities. Gross margin of 67.5% reflected the quality of our product portfolio, as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, including the benefit of 300millimeter production.\n\nOur focus on analog and embedded processing allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations. Our cash flow from operations of $8.76 billion underscored the strength of our business model. Free cash flow was $6.29 billion and represented 34.3% of revenue. During 2021, we returned $4.41 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. Over the same period, our dividend represented 62% of free cash flow, underscoring its sustainability.\n\n## Details of financial results - 2021 compared with 2020\n\nRevenue of $18.34 billion increased $3.88 billion, or 27%, due to higher revenue from Analog and, to a lesser extent, Embedded Processing.\n\nGross profit of $12.38 billion was up $3.11 billion, or 34%, primarily due to higher revenue. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit increased to 67.5% from 64.1%.\n\nOperating expenses (R&amp;D and SG&amp;A) were $3.22 billion compared with $3.15 billion.\n\nAcquisition charges were $142 million compared with $198 million and were non-cash.\n\nRestructuring charges/other was $54 million due to integration charges at our Lehi, Utah, manufacturing facility partially offset by gains on sales of assets, compared with $24 million due to an Embedded Processing action in 2020.\n\nOperating profit was $8.96 billion, or 48.8% of revenue, compared with $5.89 billion, or 40.8% of revenue.\n\nOther income and expense (OI&amp;E) was $143 million of income compared with $313 million of income, which decreased primarily due to lower royalty income. See Note 11 to the financial statements.\n\nOur provision for income taxes was $1.15 billion compared with $422 million. This increase was due to higher income before income taxes and lower discrete tax benefits compared to 2020, which included a $249 million benefit from the settlement of a depreciation-related uncertain tax position.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Intel positioned FPGAs as part of its 'adjacent products' within the Client Computing Group (CCG), Data Center Group (DCG), and Internet of Things Group (IOTG), indicating a supporting role within comprehensive platform solutions. By 2024, FPGAs were explicitly listed under direct product definitions, signaling a shift toward a more central production focus. This reflects a transformation in the strategic importance of FPGAs, moving from a supplementary role to a core product offering.",

        "In 2022, FPGAs are categorized under 'adjacent products,' indicating a supplementary role within platform solutions.",
        "In 2024, FPGAs are directly defined in the glossary, indicating a more prominent and standalone product status.",
        "The shift from being part of a broader product grouping to being directly defined and highlighted suggests a strategic evolution in the importance and positioning of FPGAs within Intel's product portfolio."

      "answer": "In 2022, Intel reported long-term income taxes payable of $4.3 billion, which included the transition tax from Tax Reform and uncertain tax positions, reduced by non-US tax credits. By 2024, this figure had decreased to $1.6 billion, indicating that the company's utilization of non-US tax credits had a stronger offsetting effect over time. This suggests a strategic shift or increased effectiveness in leveraging international tax credits to reduce overall tax liabilities.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, Intel's long-term income taxes payable were $4.3 billion, with non-US tax credits reducing the liability.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, long-term income taxes payable had decreased to $1.6 billion, again reduced by non-US tax credits, showing a significant drop from the prior amount.",
        "Step 3: The decrease indicates that non-US tax credits had a stronger impact in 2024, suggesting a more pronounced role in Intel's international tax planning strategy over time."

      "answer": "In 2022, Intel was incurring higher period charges related to the ramp-up of Intel 4, indicating early-stage production challenges and investment. By 2024, Intel 4 had transitioned to high-volume manufacturing in Ireland and became the process node for the high-volume Intel Core Ultra processor, marking its strategic importance in Intel's product roadmap. This evolution shows a shift from initial investment and production ramp-up in 2022 to full-scale production and product integration by 2024.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, Intel was facing increased period charges specifically tied to the ramp-up of Intel 4, indicating early production challenges and investment.",
        "Step 2: By 2024, Intel 4 had moved to high-volume manufacturing in Ireland and was the foundation for the Intel Core Ultra processor, a key client product. It was also positioned as a critical node in Intel's roadmap leading into 2025.",
        "Step 3: The change from a cost center with production challenges in 2022 to a strategic, high-volume manufacturing node in 2024 represents a significant transformation in Intel 4's role within the company."

Our IP portfolio includes patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, mask works, and other rights. We actively seek to protect our global IP rights and deter unauthorized use of our IP and other assets.\n\nWe have obtained patents in the US and other countries. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire, and in some cases our products may be obsolete before the patents are granted. A s we expand our product offerings, particularly around our foundry business, we also seek to extend our patent development efforts. In addition to developing patents based on our own R&amp;D efforts, we may purchase or license patents from third parties.\n\nThe software that we distribute, including software embedded in our products, is entitled to copyright and other IP protection. To distinguish our products from our competitors' products, we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products, and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine Intel components. We also protect details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.\n\nEfforts to protect our IP can be difficult, particularly  in countries that prov ide less protection to IP rights and in the absence of harmoniz ed international IP standards. Competitors and others may already have IP rights covering similar products. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain IP rights covering our own products or that we will be able to obtain IP licenses from other companies on favorable terms or at all.

With each new node, we seek improvements in performance, power efficiency, cost, and siz e to meet the needs of our products and of external foundry customers. The continued development of leading-edge nodes that are competitive with the offerings of other foundries requires significant ongoing capital investment as we pursue incremental improvements and refinements of existing transistor and layout designs and manufacturing technologies, such as EUV  lithography, while also pursuing new transistor and layout designs, such as gate-all-around and backside power in our upcoming Intel 18A  process node, and new manufacturing technologies, such as high-NA EUV lithography for use in our upcoming Intel 14A process node.\n\nAs of the end of 2024, a significant majority of our products were manufactured using our Intel 7 process node in A rizona and Israel, we successfully ramped our Intel 4 and Intel 3 process nodes as our first EUV  lithography nodes and shifted high-volume production of those nodes to Ireland, and we canceled the productization of our Intel 20A  process node to focus efforts on the improved version of the node, Intel 18A , that we expect to put into high-volume production in 2025 with our new client family of products code-named Panther Lake.\n\nOur Capital\n\n8",

The continued development of leading-edge nodes that are competitive with the offerings of other foundries requires significant ongoing capital investment as we pursue incremental improvements and refinements of existing transistor and layout designs and manufacturing technologies, such as EUV  lithography, while also pursuing new transistor and layout designs, such as gate-all-around and backside power in our upcoming Intel 18A  process node, and new manufacturing technologies, such as high-NA EUV lithography for use in our upcoming Intel 14A process node.\n\nAs of the end of 2024, a significant majority of our products were manufactured using our Intel 7 process node in A rizona and Israel, we successfully ramped our Intel 4 and Intel 3 process nodes as our first EUV  lithography nodes and shifted high-volume production of those nodes to Ireland, and we canceled the productization of our Intel 20A  process node to focus efforts on the improved version of the node, Intel 18A , that we expect to put into high-volume production in 2025 with our new client family of products code-named Panther Lake.\n\nOur Capital\n\n8",

      "answer": "In 2022, Intel recorded net losses of $748 million on economically hedged marketable debt investments. By 2024, the fair value of these hedged investments had decreased to $13.5 billion from $17.1 billion in 2023, with Intel recording net losses of $464 million in 2024. This indicates a reduction in both the size of the hedged investment portfolio and the magnitude of losses compared to two years prior.",

          "chunk_text": "The valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory, as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. We use the demand forecast to develop our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuations and build decisions. For certain new products, we have limited historical data when developing these demand forecasts. We compare the estimate of future demand to work in process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of obsolete or excess inventory. When our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we write off amounts considered to be excess inventory.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nWe compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of assets. We also capitalize interest on borrowings related to eligible capital expenditures. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified assets and depreciated together with that asset cost. We record capital-related government grants earned as a reduction to property, plant and equipment.\n\nWe evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of our property, plant and equipment, considering factors such as the process technology cadence between node transitions, changes in machinery and equipment technology, and re-use of machinery and tools across each generation of process technology. As we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we use assumptions involving the use of management judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter or longer than we had originally estimated, we adjust the rate of depreciation to reflect the assets' revised useful lives.\n\nAssets are categorized and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use and fungibility of the assets. If an asset grouping carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired.\n\n## Fair Value\n\nWhen determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, as well as assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Our financial assets are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, except for equity securities measured using the measurement alternative, equity method investments, and grants receivable. We assess fair value hierarchy levels for our issued debt and fixed-income investment portfolio based on the underlying instrument type.\n\nThe three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are:\n\n- Level 1. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. We evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether a market is active.\n- Level 2. Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in less active markets, or model-derived valuations. All significant inputs used in our valuations, such as discounted cash flows, are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. We use LIBOR-based yield curves, overnight indexed swap curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings as significant inputs in our valuations. Level 2 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices, as well as quoted prices that were adjusted for security-specific restrictions. When we use nonbinding market consensus prices, we corroborate them with quoted market prices for similar instruments or compare them to output from internally developed pricing models such as discounted cash flow models.\n- Level 3. Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or liabilities. We monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes. Level 3 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices or non-binding broker quotes that we were unable to corroborate with observable market data.\n\n## Debt Investments\n\nWe consider all highly liquid debt investments with original maturities from the date of purchase of three months or less as cash equivalents. Cash equivalents can include investments such as corporate debt, financial institution instruments, government debt, and reverse repurchase agreements.\n\nMarketable debt investments are generally designated as trading assets when a market risk is economically hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument, or when the marketable debt investment itself is used to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement. Investments designated as trading assets are reported at fair value. Gains or losses on these investments arising from changes in fair value due to interest rate and currency market fluctuations and credit market volatility, largely offset by losses or gains on the related derivative instruments and balance sheet remeasurement, are recorded in interest and other, net.\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n78",

Interest, penalties, and accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits were insignificant in the periods presented.\n\nWe regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Although the timing of the resolutions and/or closures of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that certain US federal and non-US tax audits may be concluded within the next 12 months, which could increase or decrease the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits. We estimate that the unrecognized tax benefits as of December 28, 2024, could decrease by as much as $314 million in the next 12 months.\n\nWe file federal, state, and non-US tax returns. We are no longer subject to US federal and non-US tax examinations for years prior to 2018 and 2015, respectively. For US state tax returns, we are no longer subject to tax examination for years prior to 2015.\n\nNote 9 :\n\nInvestments\n\n## Short-term Investments\n\nShort-term investments include marketable debt investments in corporate debt, government debt, and financial institution instruments, and are recorded within cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Government debt includes instruments such as non-US government bills and bonds and US agency securities. Financial institution instruments include instruments issued or managed by financial institutions in various forms, such as commercial paper, fixed- and floating-rate bonds, money market fund deposits, and time deposits. A s of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, substantially all time deposits were issued by institutions outside the US.\n\nThe fair value of our economically hedged marketable debt investments was $13.5 billion as of December 28, 2024 ($17.1 billion as of December 30, 2023). For hedged investments still held at the reporting date, we recorded net losses of $464 million in 2024 (net gains of $534 million in 2023 and net losses of $748 million in 2022).\n\nOur remaining unhedged marketable debt investments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) . The adjusted cost of our unhedged investments was $5.2 billion as of December 28, 2024 ($4.7 billion as of December 30, 2023), which approximated the fair value for these periods.\n\nThe fair value of marketable debt investments, by contractual maturity, as of December 28, 2024, was as follows:\n\n",

This requires simulating the physical behavior of light and materials, or physically-based rendering. NVIDIA Omniverse is a virtual  world  simulation  and  collaboration  platform  for  3D  workflows  that  is  available  as  a  software  subscription  for enterprise  use  and  free  for  individual  use.  Omniverse,  VR  and AR  are  being  incorporated  in  a  growing  number  of enterprise  applications.  Virtual  car  showrooms,  surgical  training,  architectural  walkthroughs,  and  bringing  historical scenes to life all deploy these technologies, powered by our GPUs.\n\n## Automotive\n\nNVIDIA's Automotive market is comprised of cockpit AV platforms, AI cockpit and infotainment solutions, and associated development agreements. Leveraging our technology leadership in AI and building on our long-standing automotive relationships, we are delivering a complete end-to-end solution for the AV market under the DRIVE brand. NVIDIA has demonstrated multiple applications of AI within the car: AI can drive the car itself as a pilot in fully autonomous mode or it can also be a co-pilot, assisting the human driver while creating a safer driving experience.\n\nNVIDIA is working with several hundred partners in the automotive ecosystem including automakers, truck makers, tierone  suppliers,  sensor  manufacturers,  automotive  research  institutions,  HD  mapping  companies,  and  startups  to develop and deploy AI systems for self-driving vehicles. Our unified AI computing architecture starts with training deep neural networks using our GPUs, and then running a full perception, planning and control stack within the vehicle on the NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion platform. The DRIVE Hyperion platform consists of the high-performance, energy efficient DRIVE AGX computing hardware, a reference sensor set that supports full self-driving capability as well as an open, modular  DRIVE  Software  platform.  We  recently  announced  for  future  release  the  DRIVE  Software  platform  that includes DRIVE Chauffeur - based on NVIDIA DRIVE AV software to enable autonomous driving, mapping and parking services; and Drive Concierge - based on NVIDIA DRIVE IX software for intelligent in-vehicle experiences and NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar software for real time conversational AI capability.\n\nNVIDIA DRIVE can perceive and understand in real-time what is happening around the vehicle, precisely locate itself on an HD map, and plan a safe path forward. This advanced self-driving car platform combines deep learning, sensor fusion, and surround vision to change the driving experience. Our DRIVE platform scales from a palm-sized, energyefficient module for automated highway-driving capabilities to a configuration with multiple systems aimed at enabling driverless  cars.  Our  newest  system-on-a-chip,  or  SoC,  Orin,  which  started  shipping  in  fiscal  year  2022,  enables vehicles  to  use  deep  neural  networks  to  process  data  from  multiple  cameras  and  sensors.  It  powers  the  DRIVE AutoPilot, NVIDIA's automated driving solution, combining the DRIVE AV self-driving solution with the DRIVE IX cockpit software, including a visualization system for allowing the driver to see what the car sees and plans to do.\n\nIn addition, we offer a scalable data center-based simulation solution, NVIDIA DRIVE Constellation running DRIVE Sim software, for testing and validating a self-driving platform before commercial deployment. NVIDIA's unique end-to-end, software-defined approach is designed for continuous innovation and continuous development, enabling cars to receive over-the-air updates to add new features and capabilities throughout the life of a vehicle.\n\n## Business Strategies\n\nNVIDIA's key strategies that shape our overall business approach include:\n\nAdvancing  the  NVIDIA  accelerated  computing  platform. NVIDIA's  accelerated  computing  platform  can  solve complex  problems  in  significantly  less  time  and  with  lower  power  consumption  than  alternative  computational approaches. Indeed, it can help solve problems that were previously deemed unsolvable. We work to deliver continued performance leaps that outpace Moore's Law by leveraging innovation across the architecture, chip design, system, and  software  layers.  With  our  acquisition  of  Mellanox,  we  strengthened  our  end-to-end  expertise  in  data  center architectures, positioning us for a future when the data center is the new unit of computing. This full-stack innovation approach allows us to deliver order-of-magnitude performance advantages relative to legacy approaches in our target markets,  which  include  Gaming,  Data  Center,  Professional  Visualization,  and  Automotive.  While  the  computing requirements of these end markets are diverse, we address them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs and CUDA as the fundamental building blocks. The programmable nature of our architecture allows us to make leveraged  investments  in  R&amp;D:  we  can  support  several  multi-billion-dollar  end  markets  with  the  same  underlying technology by using a variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third party developers and partners. We utilize this platform approach in each of our target markets.\n\nExtending  our  technology  and  platform  leadership  in  AI. We  provide  a  complete,  end-to-end  accelerated computing platform for deep learning and machine learning, addressing both training and inferencing. This includes GPUs, interconnects, systems, our CUDA programming language, algorithms, libraries, and other software. GPUs are uniquely suited to AI, and we will continue to add AI-specific features to our GPU architecture to further extend our leadership",

          "chunk_text": "position.  Our AI  technology leadership is reinforced by our large and expanding ecosystem in a virtuous cycle. Our GPU platforms are available from virtually every major server maker and cloud service provider, as well as on our own AI supercomputer. There are almost 3 million developers worldwide using CUDA and our other software tools to help deploy our technology in our target markets. We evangelize AI through partnerships with hundreds of universities and almost 10,000 startups through our Inception program. Additionally, our Deep Learning Institute provides instruction on the  latest  techniques  on  how  to  design,  train,  and  deploy  neural  networks  in  applications  using  our  accelerated computing platform.\n\nExtending our technology and platform leadership in computer graphics. We believe that computer graphics is fundamental  to  the  continued  expansion  and  evolution  of  computing.  We  apply  our  research  and  development resources to enhance the user experience for consumer entertainment and professional visualization applications, and create new virtual world and simulation capabilities. Our technologies are instrumental in driving gaming forward, as developers leverage our libraries and algorithms to deliver an optimized gaming experience on our GeForce platform. Our computer graphics platforms  leverage  not  only  our  industry-leading  GeForce  and  NVIDIA  RTX  GPUs,  but  also optimized software stacks. For example, GeForce Experience enhances each gamer's experience by optimizing their PC's settings, as well as enabling the recording and sharing of gameplay. Our Studio drivers enhance and accelerate a number of popular creative applications. Omniverse is real-time 3D design collaboration and virtual world simulation software that empowers artists, designers and creators to connect and collaborate in leading design applications. We also enable interactive graphics applications - such as games, movie and photo editing and design software - to be accessed  by  almost  any  device,  almost  anywhere,  through  our  cloud  platforms  such  as  vGPU  for  enterprise  and GeForce NOW for gaming.\n\nAdvancing  the  leading  autonomous  vehicle  platform. We  believe  the  advent  of  AV  will  soon  revolutionize  the transportation industry. In our view, AI is the key technology enabler of this opportunity, as the algorithms required for autonomous  driving  -  such  as  perception,  localization,  and  planning  -  are  too  complex  for  legacy  hand-coded approaches and will run on multiple trained neural networks instead. Therefore, we provide a full functionally safe AIbased hardware and software solution for the AV market under the DRIVE brand, which we are bringing to market through our partnerships with automotive original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, tier-1 suppliers, and start-ups. Our AV solution also includes the GPU-based hardware required to train the neural networks before their in-vehicle deployment,  as  well  as  to  re-simulate  their  operation  prior  to  any  over-the-air  software  updates.  We  believe  our comprehensive, top-to-bottom and end-to-end approach will enable the transportation industry to solve the complex problems arising from the shift to autonomous driving.\n\nLeveraging  our  intellectual  property,  or  IP. We believe  our  IP  is  a  valuable  asset  that  can  be  accessed  by  our customers  and  partners  through  license  and  development  agreements  when  they  desire  to  build  such  capabilities directly  into  their  own  products,  or  have  us  do  so  through  a  custom  development.  Such  license  and  development arrangements can further enhance the reach of our technology.\n\n## Sales and Marketing\n\nOur  worldwide  sales  and  marketing  strategy  is  key  to  achieving  our  objective  of  providing  markets  with  our  highperformance and efficient computing platforms and software. Our sales and marketing teams, located across our global markets, work closely with end customers and various industry ecosystems through our partner network. Our partner network incorporates each industry's respective OEMs, original device manufacturers, or ODMs, system builders, addin  board  manufacturers,  or  AIBs,  retailers/distributors,  ISVs,  internet  and  cloud  service  providers,  automotive manufacturers and tier-1 automotive suppliers, mapping companies, start-ups, and other ecosystem participants.\n\nMembers of our sales team have technical expertise and product and industry knowledge. We also employ a team of application engineers and solution architects to assist our partner network in designing, testing, and qualifying system designs that incorporate our platforms. We believe that the depth and quality of our design support are key to improving our partner network's time-to-market, maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction, and fostering relationships that encourage our end customers and partner network to use the next generation of our products within each platform.\n\nTo  encourage  the  development  of  applications  optimized  for  our  platforms  and  software,  we  seek  to  establish  and maintain strong relationships in the software development community. Engineering and marketing personnel engage with  key  software  developers  to  promote  and  discuss  our  platforms,  as  well  as  to  ascertain  individual  product requirements and solve technical problems. Our developer program makes our products available to developers prior to launch in order to encourage the development of AI frameworks, SDKs, and APIs for software applications and game titles  that  are  optimized  for  our  platforms.  Our  Deep  Learning  Institute  provides  in-person  and  online  training  for developers in industries and organizations around the world to build AI and accelerated computing applications that leverage our platforms.",

          "chunk_text": "position.  Our AI  technology leadership is reinforced by our large and expanding ecosystem in a virtuous cycle. Our GPU platforms are available from virtually every major server maker and cloud service provider, as well as on our own AI supercomputer. There are almost 3 million developers worldwide using CUDA and our other software tools to help deploy our technology in our target markets. We evangelize AI through partnerships with hundreds of universities and almost 10,000 startups through our Inception program. Additionally, our Deep Learning Institute provides instruction on the  latest  techniques  on  how  to  design,  train,  and  deploy  neural  networks  in  applications  using  our  accelerated computing platform.\n\nExtending our technology and platform leadership in computer graphics. We believe that computer graphics is fundamental  to  the  continued  expansion  and  evolution  of  computing.  We  apply  our  research  and  development resources to enhance the user experience for consumer entertainment and professional visualization applications, and create new virtual world and simulation capabilities.

This requires simulating the physical behavior of light and materials, or physically-based rendering. NVIDIA Omniverse is a virtual  world  simulation  and  collaboration  platform  for  3D  workflows  that  is  available  as  a  software  subscription  for enterprise  use  and  free  for  individual  use.  Omniverse,  VR  and AR  are  being  incorporated  in  a  growing  number  of enterprise  applications.  Virtual  car  showrooms,  surgical  training,  architectural  walkthroughs,  and  bringing  historical scenes to life all deploy these technologies, powered by our GPUs.\n\n## Automotive\n\nNVIDIA's Automotive market is comprised of cockpit AV platforms, AI cockpit and infotainment solutions, and associated development agreements. Leveraging our technology leadership in AI and building on our long-standing automotive relationships, we are delivering a complete end-to-end solution for the AV market under the DRIVE brand. NVIDIA has demonstrated multiple applications of AI within the car: AI can drive the car itself as a pilot in fully autonomous mode or it can also be a co-pilot, assisting the human driver while creating a safer driving experience.\n\nNVIDIA is working with several hundred partners in the automotive ecosystem including automakers, truck makers, tierone  suppliers,  sensor  manufacturers,  automotive  research  institutions,  HD  mapping  companies,  and  startups  to develop and deploy AI systems for self-driving vehicles. Our unified AI computing architecture starts with training deep neural networks using our GPUs, and then running a full perception, planning and control stack within the vehicle on the NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion platform. The DRIVE Hyperion platform consists of the high-performance, energy efficient DRIVE AGX computing hardware, a reference sensor set that supports full self-driving capability as well as an open, modular  DRIVE  Software  platform.  We  recently  announced  for  future  release  the  DRIVE  Software  platform  that includes DRIVE Chauffeur - based on NVIDIA DRIVE AV software to enable autonomous driving, mapping and parking services; and Drive Concierge - based on NVIDIA DRIVE IX software for intelligent in-vehicle experiences and NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar software for real time conversational AI capability.\n\nNVIDIA DRIVE can perceive and understand in real-time what is happening around the vehicle, precisely locate itself on an HD map, and plan a safe path forward. This advanced self-driving car platform combines deep learning, sensor fusion, and surround vision to change the driving experience. Our DRIVE platform scales from a palm-sized, energyefficient module for automated highway-driving capabilities to a configuration with multiple systems aimed at enabling driverless  cars.

      "question": "How has Qualcomm's strategic involvement with on-device artificial intelligence (AI) evolved from 2023 to 2024, particularly in terms of its business focus and investment approach?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Qualcomm was actively producing on-device AI technologies as part of its broader portfolio of foundational technologies, including wireless connectivity and low-power computing. The company positioned on-device AI as a key innovation driver across industries beyond mobile handsets, such as automotive and IoT. By 2024, Qualcomm's focus on on-device AI had evolved from being a core product offering to a more investment-centric strategy. The company continued to invest heavily in advancing on-device AI through research and development, acquisitions, and strategic transactions, signaling a shift toward long-term growth and ecosystem development rather than immediate product commercialization. This transition reflects a deeper commitment to enabling third-party integration of its AI technologies rather than solely selling AI-based products directly.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, Qualcomm explicitly stated it was producing on-device AI technologies as part of its foundational technology suite, indicating active product development and commercialization.",
        "Step 2: By 2024, the company's disclosures shifted to emphasize investment in on-device AI, including R&D, acquisitions, and strategic transactions, suggesting a broader, ecosystem-focused approach.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a strategic evolution from direct product development to a more investment-driven model aimed at enabling broader industry adoption and long-term growth."

See also the Risk Factor titled ' Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).'\n\nPolitical actions, including trade protection and national security policies of the U.S. and Chinese governments, such as tariffs, bans or placing companies on restricted entity lists, have in the past, currently are and could in the future limit or prevent us from transacting business with certain of our Chinese customers or suppliers, limit, prevent or discourage certain of our Chinese customers or suppliers from transacting business with us, or make it more expensive to do so. Given our revenue concentration in China, if, due to actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies: we were further limited in, or prohibited from, selling our integrated circuit products to Chinese customers; our non-Chinese OEM customers were limited in, or prohibited from, selling devices that incorporate our integrated circuit products into China; Chinese OEMs develop and use their own integrated circuit products or use our competitors' integrated circuit products in some or all of their devices rather than our integrated circuit products; Chinese tariffs on our integrated circuit products or on devices which incorporate our integrated circuit products made purchasing such products or devices more expensive to our Chinese customers or Chinese consumers; or our Chinese licensees delay or cease making payments of license fees they owe us, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially harmed. Similarly, if, due to U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, we were limited in or prohibited from obtaining critical integrated circuit products from our suppliers in China, or we or our customers were limited in or prohibited from selling in the United States products containing technologies with Chinese-origin content, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially harmed. See also the Risk Factors titled ' We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier handset devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected ' and ' Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).'\n\nFor example, we previously sold 4G and other integrated circuit products, including Wi-Fi products, but excluding 5G products, to Huawei under export licenses from the U.S. Department of Commerce. On May 7, 2024, the U.S. Department of Commerce informed us that it was revoking our license to export 4G and certain other integrated circuit products to Huawei, effective immediately, and we implemented procedures to immediately comply. Accordingly, we do not expect to receive any further product revenues from Huawei. Product revenues from Huawei in fiscal 2024, prior to our license being revoked on May 7, 2024, were approximately $560 million. Additionally, to the ex tent that Huawei's devices take share from Chinese OEMs that utilize our products or from non-Chinese OEMs that utilize our products in devices they sell into China, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows could be further impacted.\n\nFinally, government policies in China that regulate the amount and timing of funds that may flow out of the country have impacted and may continue to impact the timing of our receipt of, and/or ability to receive, payments from our customers and licensees in China, which may negatively impact our cash flows.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO NEW INITIATIVES\n\nOur growth depends in part on our ability to extend our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets.

      "question": "How has the risk associated with the concentration of device share among premium tier companies evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of its potential impact on Qualcomm's pricing power and revenue stability?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Qualcomm highlighted that the concentration of device share among a few premium tier companies was contributing to a trend of deriving a significant portion of revenues from a small number of customers, particularly Chinese OEMs. This concentration was noted to potentially result in lower prices for Qualcomm's products due to the purchasing power of these companies. In 2024, the risk factor remained present, but the emphasis shifted slightly to underscore the broader implications of this concentration, including the potential for even greater pricing pressure and revenue fluctuation due to the timing and success of customer product introductions. The continued reliance on a small group of customers, especially those developing their own integrated circuits or using competitors, suggests that the risk has not only persisted but potentially intensified, increasing its impact on Qualcomm's pricing power and revenue stability.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, the concentration of device share among a few companies was identified as a risk that could lead to lower product prices due to the purchasing power of these concentrated customers.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the same risk was reiterated, but with an added emphasis on the potential for increased pricing pressure and revenue instability due to customer-specific product cycles and vertical integration.",
        "Step 3: The evolution of the risk indicates a transformation in its potential impact, shifting from a general concern about pricing to a more specific warning about revenue volatility and intensified competitive pressures."

Risk Factors\n\nYou should consider each of the following factors in evaluating our business and our prospects, any of which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and require significant management time and attention. Further, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and require significant management time and attention. In such cases, the trading price of our common stock could decline. You should also consider the other information set forth in this Annual Report in evaluating our business and our prospects, including but not limited to our financial statements and the related notes, and 'Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.' References to 'and,' 'or' and 'and/or' should be read to include the others, as appropriate.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATING BUSINESSES\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier handset devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier handset devices, and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future. The mobile industry is experiencing and may continue to experience concentration of device share among a few companies, particularly at the premium tier, contributing to this trend. Certain Chinese original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have increased and may continue to increase their device share in China and in certain regions outside of China, and we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of these OEMs as well. See also 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2. Composition of Certain Financial Statement Items - Concentrations.'\n\nIn addition, a number of our largest customers have developed, are developing or may develop their own integrated circuit products, or may choose our competitors' integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, currently utilize and may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products, which could significantly reduce the revenues we derive from these customers. See also the Risk Factor titled ' Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products) .'\n\nFurther, political actions, including trade and/or national security protection policies, or other actions by governments, particularly the U.S. and Chinese governments, have in the past, currently are and could in the future limit or prevent us from transacting business with certain of our customers, limit, prevent or discourage those customers from transacting business with us, or make it more expensive to do so, any of which could also significantly reduce the revenues we derive from these customers. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions .'\n\nIn addition, we spend a significant amount of engineering and development time, funds and resources in understanding our key customers' feedback and/or specifications and attempt to incorporate such input into our product launches and technologies. These efforts may not require or result in purchase commitments from such customers or we may have lower purchases from such customers than expected, and consequently, we may not achieve the anticipated revenues from these efforts, or these efforts may result in non-recoverable costs.\n\nThe loss of any one of our significant customers, a reduction in the purchases of our products by any of these customers or the cancellation of significant purchases by any of these customers, whether due to the use of their own integrated circuit products or our competitors' integrated circuit products, government restrictions, a decline in global, regional or local economic conditions, a decline in consumer demand (or a shift in consumer demand away from new devices in favor of refurbished or secondhand devices), elevated inventory levels at our customers or otherwise, would reduce our revenues and could harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected results of operations. A delay of significant purchases, even if only temporary, would reduce our revenues in the period of the delay. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, the concentration of device share among a few companies, and the corresponding purchasing power of these companies, may result in lower prices for our products, which could have an adverse effect on our revenues and margins. In addition, the timing and size of purchases by our significant customers may be impacted by the timing of such customers' new or next generation product introductions, over which we have no control, and the timing and success of such introductions may cause our revenues and results of operations to fluctuate.\n\nApple purchases our MDM (or thin modem) products, which do not include our integrated application processor technology, and which have lower revenue and margin contributions than our combined modem and application processor",

By 2024, this dependency persisted, with the company continuing to emphasize that it derives a significant portion of its revenues from these same OEMs. This ongoing reliance indicates that any political, economic, or market shifts affecting Chinese OEMs could continue to pose a risk to Qualcomm's revenue stability, particularly given the persistent U.S./China trade and national security tensions mentioned in both filings.",

Risk Factors\n\nYou should consider each of the following factors in evaluating our business and our prospects, any of which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and require significant management time and attention. Further, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and require significant management time and attention. In such cases, the trading price of our common stock could decline. You should also consider the other information set forth in this Annual Report in evaluating our business and our prospects, including but not limited to our financial statements and the related notes, and 'Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.' References to 'and,' 'or' and 'and/or' should be read to include the others, as appropriate.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATING BUSINESSES\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier handset devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier handset devices, and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future. The mobile industry is experiencing and may continue to experience concentration of device share among a few companies, particularly at the premium tier, contributing to this trend. Certain Chinese original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have increased and may continue to increase their device share in China and in certain regions outside of China, and we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of these OEMs as well. See also 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2. Composition of Certain Financial Statement Items - Concentrations.'\n\nIn addition, a number of our largest customers have developed, are developing or may develop their own integrated circuit products, or may choose our competitors' integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, currently utilize and may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products, which could significantly reduce the revenues we derive from these customers. See also the Risk Factor titled ' Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products) .'\n\nFurther, political actions, including trade and/or national security protection policies, or other actions by governments, particularly the U.S. and Chinese governments, have in the past, currently are and could in the future limit or prevent us from transacting business with certain of our customers, limit, prevent or discourage those customers from transacting business with us, or make it more expensive to do so, any of which could also significantly reduce the revenues we derive from these customers. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions .'\n\nIn addition, we spend a significant amount of engineering and development time, funds and resources in understanding our key customers' feedback and/or specifications and attempt to incorporate such input into our product launches and technologies. These efforts may not require or result in purchase commitments from such customers or we may have lower purchases from such customers than expected, and consequently, we may not achieve the anticipated revenues from these efforts, or these efforts may result in non-recoverable costs.\n\nThe loss of any one of our significant customers, a reduction in the purchases of our products by any of these customers or the cancellation of significant purchases by any of these customers, whether due to the use of their own integrated circuit products or our competitors' integrated circuit products, government restrictions, a decline in global, regional or local economic conditions, a decline in consumer demand (or a shift in consumer demand away from new devices in favor of refurbished or secondhand devices), elevated inventory levels at our customers or otherwise, would reduce our revenues and could harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected results of operations. A delay of significant purchases, even if only temporary, would reduce our revenues in the period of the delay. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, the concentration of device share among a few companies, and the corresponding purchasing power of these companies, may result in lower prices for our products, which could have an adverse effect on our revenues and margins. In addition, the timing and size of purchases by our significant customers may be impacted by the timing of such customers' new or next generation product introductions, over which we have no control, and the timing and success of such introductions may cause our revenues and results of operations to fluctuate.\n\nApple purchases our MDM (or thin modem) products, which do not include our integrated application processor technology, and which have lower revenue and margin contributions than our combined modem and application processor",

Given our revenue concentration in China, if, due to actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies: we were further limited in, or prohibited from, selling our integrated circuit products to Chinese customers; our non-Chinese OEM customers were limited in, or prohibited from, selling devices that incorporate our integrated circuit products into China; Chinese OEMs develop and use their own integrated circuit products or use our competitors' integrated circuit products in some or all of their devices rather than our integrated circuit products; Chinese tariffs on our integrated circuit products or on devices which incorporate our integrated circuit products made purchasing such products or devices more expensive to our Chinese customers or Chinese consumers; or our Chinese licensees delay or cease making payments of license fees they owe us, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially harmed. Similarly, if, due to U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, we were limited in or prohibited from obtaining critical integrated circuit products from our suppliers in China, or we or our customers were limited in or prohibited from selling in the United States products containing technologies with Chinese-origin content, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially harmed.

On May 7, 2024, the U.S. Department of Commerce informed us that it was revoking our license to export 4G and certain other integrated circuit products to Huawei, effective immediately, and we implemented procedures to immediately comply. Accordingly, we do not expect to receive any further product revenues from Huawei. Product revenues from Huawei in fiscal 2024, prior to our license being revoked on May 7, 2024, were approximately $560 million. Additionally, to the ex tent that Huawei's devices take share from Chinese OEMs that utilize our products or from non-Chinese OEMs that utilize our products in devices they sell into China, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows could be further impacted.\n\nFinally, government policies in China that regulate the amount and timing of funds that may flow out of the country have impacted and may continue to impact the timing of our receipt of, and/or ability to receive, payments from our customers and licensees in China, which may negatively impact our cash flows.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO NEW INITIATIVES\n\nOur growth depends in part on our ability to extend our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets. Our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications, and related technologies and products, as well as in our existing technologies and products, and new technologies, may not generate operating income or contribute to future results of operations that meet our expectations.\n\nWhile we continue to invest significant resources toward advancements of foundational technologies, including wireless connectivity, high-performance and lowpower computing and on-device artificial intelligence (AI), we also invest in new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, by utilizing our ex isting technical and business ex pertise and through acquisitions or other strategic transactions.\n\nIn particular, our future growth depends in part on new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, such as automotive and IoT; our ability to develop leading and cost-effective technologies and products for these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications; and third parties incorporating our technologies and products into devices used in these product areas, industries and applications.

We, alongside other top technology companies, helped form the Reboot Representation Tech Coalition, which aims to double the number of Black, Latinx and Native American women receiving computing degrees by 2025. We have also been named a 'Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion' by Disability:IN for ten years in a row, underscoring our commitment to an inclusive work environment for people with disabilities.\n\nWe publish our most recent Consolidated EEO-1 reports on our website to provide additional transparency into our workforce.\n\nHealth, Safety and Wellness. The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. Through our Live+Well, Work+Well programs, we provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flex ible and convenient health and wellness programs, including benefits that provide protection and security related to events that may require time away from work or that impact their financial well-being; that support their physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors; and that offer choice where possible so they can customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families.\n\nCompensation and Benefits. We provide robust compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs may include (depending on country/region) annual bonuses, stock awards, an employee stock purchase plan, retirement and savings plans, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, flex ible work schedules, adoption and surrogacy assistance, employee assistance programs, tuition assistance, and on-site services such as health and fitness centers, among others. In addition to our broad-based equity award programs, we have used targeted equity awards with vesting conditions to facilitate retention of personnel, particularly those with critical engineering skills and ex perience.\n\nTalent Development. We invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to remain a world-leading innovator in wireless technologies and highperformance and low-power computing, including AI. We deliver numerous training opportunities, provide rotational assignment opportunities, focus on continuous learning and development and have implemented what we believe are industry-leading methodologies to manage performance, provide feedback and develop talent.\n\nOur talent development programs are designed to provide employees with the resources they need to help achieve their career goals, build management skills and lead their organizations. We provide a series of employee workshops around the globe that support professional growth and development. Additionally, our manager and employee forum programs provide an ongoing opportunity for employees to practice and apply learning around conversations aligned with our annual review process. We also have an employee development website that provides quick access to learning resources that are personalized to the individual's development needs.\n\nBuilding Connections - With Each Other and our Communities. We believe that building connections between our employees, their families and our communities creates a more meaningful, fulfilling and enjoyable workplace. Through our engagement programs, our employees can pursue their interests and hobbies, connect to volunteering and giving opportunities and enjoy unique recreational experiences with family members. Leveraging our partnerships with various local arts and culture organizations, we have created numerous unique experiences for employees and their families around the world.\n\nSince our employees are passionate about many causes, our corporate giving and volunteering programs support and encourage employees by engaging with those causes. In our offices around the world, our employee-led Giving Committees select local organizations to support, often in the form of grants that are primarily funded by the Qualcomm Foundation (which was established in 2011 to support charitable giving and volunteerism). We also frequently collaborate with these organizations on volunteer activities for our employees. Additionally, during fiscal 2024, thousands of our employees around the world utilized our charitable match program, benefiting more than 1,300 charitable organizations.\n\nHuman Capital Advancements Linked to our Executive Compensation. The HR and Compensation Committee of our Board will consider human capital advancements in determining our executives' fiscal 2024 bonus. For fiscal 2024, progress towards human capital advancements serves as a non-financial performance modifier that can adjust the ex ecutives' bonus payout by a multiple of 0.9 to 1.1.\n\nThe foregoing discussion includes information regarding Human Capital matters that we believe may be of interest to stockholders generally. We recognize that certain other stakeholders (such as customers, employees and non-governmental organizations), as well as certain of our stockholders, may be interested in more detailed information on these topics. We encourage you to review the 'Workforce' section of our most recent Qualcomm Corporate Responsibility Report (located on our website) for more detailed information regarding our Human Capital programs and initiatives. Nothing on our website, including our Consolidated EEO-1 reports and our Qualcomm Corporate Responsibility Report or sections thereof, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, Accenture purchased 1,964,612 Class A ordinary shares under the publicly announced open-market share purchase program for an aggregate price of $576 million. Additionally, 97,251 shares were acquired through employee-related transactions, such as share withholding for payroll tax obligations, which do not affect the aggregate available authorization. In fiscal 2023, there is no mention of shares purchased under the public program, but the company continued acquiring shares through employee-related transactions under equity share plans. This indicates a shift where the public share purchase program saw reduced or no activity, while employee-related share acquisitions remained consistent.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Accenture actively utilized its public share purchase program, acquiring over 1.9 million shares for $576 million, and also acquired nearly 97,251 shares through employee-related transactions.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the public share purchase program is only referenced in general terms without any reported purchases, while employee-related share acquisitions are again mentioned, indicating continuity in that area.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a decrease in public share repurchases under the open-market program from 2022 to 2023, while employee-related share transactions remained stable, suggesting a strategic shift or pause in the broader share repurchase activity."

      "answer": "In 2022, Accenture disclosed an aggregate available authorization of $3,129,296 for publicly announced open-market share purchase programs and other share purchase programs involving Accenture plc Class A Ordinary Shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares. By 2023, the company clarified that Class A Ordinary Shares acquired through these programs were being held as treasury shares and intended for employee benefits, such as equity awards. Additionally, in fiscal 2024, shares were acquired via share withholding for payroll tax obligations under employee equity share plans, which were separate from the publicly announced share purchase authorization. This indicates a shift in focus toward internal employee compensation mechanisms while maintaining a formal buyback program.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, Accenture disclosed a specific dollar amount ($3,129,296) available for share purchase programs involving Class A Ordinary Shares and exchangeable shares.",

Each Class A ordinary share entitles its holder to a pro rata part of any dividend at the times and in the amounts, if any, which Accenture plc's Board of Directors from time to time determines to declare, subject to any preferred dividend rights attaching to any preferred shares. Each Class A ordinary share is entitled on a winding-up of Accenture plc to be paid a pro rata part of the value of the assets of Accenture plc remaining after payment of its liabilities, subject to any preferred rights on liquidation attaching to any preferred shares.\n\n## Class X Ordinary Shares\n\nMost of our pre-incorporation partners who received Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares in connection with our transition to a corporate structure received a corresponding number of Accenture plc Class X ordinary shares. An Accenture plc Class X ordinary share entitles its holder to one vote per share, and holders of those shares do not have cumulative voting rights. A Class X ordinary share does not entitle its holder to receive dividends, and holders of those shares are not entitled to be paid any amount upon a winding-up of Accenture plc. Accenture plc may redeem, at its option, any Class X ordinary share for a redemption price equal to the par value of the Class X ordinary share. Accenture plc has separately agreed with the original holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares not to redeem any Class X ordinary share of such holder if the redemption would reduce the number of Class X ordinary shares held by that holder to a number that is less than the number of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares owned by that holder, as the case may be. Accenture plc will redeem Class X ordinary shares upon the redemption or exchange of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares so that the aggregate number of Class X ordinary shares outstanding at any time does not exceed the aggregate number of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares outstanding. Class X ordinary shares are not transferable without the consent of Accenture plc.\n\n## Equity of Subsidiaries Redeemable or Exchangeable for Accenture plc Class A Ordinary Shares\n\n## Accenture Canada Holdings Inc.

Holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares may exchange their shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares at any time on a one-for-one basis. We may, at our option, satisfy this exchange with cash at a price per share generally equal to the market price of an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share at the time of the exchange. Each exchangeable share of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. entitles its holder to receive distributions equal to any distributions to which an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share entitles its holder.\n\n## Share Purchases and Redemptions\n\nThe Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees.

As of August 31, 2022, the carrying amount of our investment was $138,902, and the estimated fair value of our approximately 16% ownership was $223,166. We account for the investment under the equity method because we have the ability to influence operations through the combination of our voting power and through other factors, such as representation on the board and our business relationship.\n\nFor equity securities without a readily determinable fair value, we use the fair value measurement alternative and measure the securities at cost less impairment, if any, plus or minus observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization\n\nSee table below for summary of depreciation on fixed assets, deferred transition amortization, intangible assets amortization and operating lease cost for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n",

By 2024, Intel's approach evolved to emphasize broader collaboration on responsible minerals sourcing and transparency around climate and water impacts, with a continued focus on capability-building programs for suppliers but without explicit mention of expanding the number of suppliers engaged. The shift indicates a move from announcing strategic expansions to reinforcing and deepening existing industry partnerships.",

          "chunk_text": "## Compensation and Benefits\n\nWe structure pay, benefits, and services to meet the varying needs of our employees, helping support employee financial well-being with competitive compensation, investment opportunities, and financial resources. Our total rewards package includes market-competitive pay, broad-based stock grants and bonuses, an employee stock purchase plan, healthcare and retirement benefits, paid time off and family leave, parent reintegration, family expansion assistance, flex ible work schedules, sabbaticals, and on-site services. Since 2019, we have achieved gender pay equity globally and we continue to maintain race/ethnicity pay equity in the US. We achieve pay equity by closing the gap in average pay between employees of different genders or race/ethnicity in the same or similar roles after accounting for legitimate business factors that can explain differences, such as location, time at grade level, and tenure. We have also advanced transparency in our pay and representation data by publicly releasing our EEO-1 survey pay data since 2019. We believe that our holistic approach toward pay equity, representation, and creating an inclusive culture enables us to cultivate a workplace that helps employees develop and progress in their careers at all levels. Our \"hybrid-first\" approach to working was informed by employees surveyed around the globe and involves the majority of our employees splitting their time between working remotely and in the office. Hybrid-first and remote work options cast a wider recruitment net and support our ambition to hire the best global talent. Currently, there is no company-wide mandate on the number of days per week employees should be on site or how they should collaborate. Our goal is to enable remote and on-site work where it drives the best output, while providing our employees with equitable access to systems, resources, and opportunities that allow them to succeed.\n\n## Health, Safety, and Wellness\n\nWe are committed to providing a safe and injury-free workplace. We regularly invest in programs designed to improve physical, mental, and social well-being. We provide access to a variety of innovative, flexible, and convenient health and wellness programs, including on-site health centers, and we aim to increase awareness of and support for mental and behavioral health. We intend to continue our efforts to build our strong safety culture and drive the global expansion of our corporate wellness program through employee education and engagement activities.\n\n## Social and Relationship Capital\n\nWe are committed to engaging in initiatives that support our communities and help us develop trusted relationships with our stakeholders. Proactive engagement with our stakeholders and investments in social impact initiatives, including those aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, advance our position as a leading corporate citizen and create shared value for Intel, our global supply chain, and our communities.\n\nEconomic and social. The health of our business and local economies depends in part on continued investments in innovation. We provide high-skill, highpaying jobs around the world, many of which are manufacturing and R&amp;D jobs located in our factories. A s we expand operations in both existing and new locations, we are building a pipeline of qualified workers through our talent strategy and the many investments we are making in education. We also benefit economies through our R&amp;D ecosystem spending, sourcing activities, employee spending, and tax payments.\n\nHuman rights commitment. We are committed to maintaining and improving systems and processes to avoid causing or contributing to adverse impacts on human rights in our operations, products, and supply chain. We have established an integrated approach to managing human rights across our business, including senior-level management involvement and board-level oversight. We also meet throughout the year with external stakeholders and experts on human rights to continue to inform and evolve our human rights policies and oversight processes. While we do not always know nor can we control what products our customers create or the applications end users may develop, we do not support or tolerate our products being used to adversely impact human rights. Where we become aware of a concern that Intel products are being used by a business partner in connection with abuses of human rights, we intend to evaluate and restrict or cease business with the third party unless and until we have high confidence that Intel's products are not being used to adversely impact human rights.\n\n## Supply Chain Responsibility\n\nWe actively manage our supply chain to help reduce risk, improve product quality, achieve environmental and social goals, and improve overall performance and value creation for Intel, our customers, and our suppliers. To drive responsible and sustainable practices throughout our supply chain, we have robust programs to educate and engage suppliers that support our global manufacturing operations. We actively collaborate with other companies and lead industry initiatives on key issues such as improving transparency around climate and water impacts in the global electronics supply chain, and we are advancing collaboration across our industry on responsible minerals sourcing. Through these efforts, we help set electronics industry-wide standards, develop audit processes, and conduct training.\n\nOver the past decade, we have directly engaged with suppliers to verify compliance and build operational capacity to address risks of forced and bonded labor and other human rights issues. We perform periodic audits and identify critical direct suppliers to engage through capability-building programs, which help suppliers build sustainability acumen and verify compliance with the Responsible Business A lliance and the Intel Code of Conduct. We also engage with indirect suppliers through our programs on forced and bonded labor, responsible minerals, and supplier diversity.\n\nOur Capital\n\n11",

We develop high-performance, A I-enabled compute platforms that solve for technology and business use cases that scale across several industries, such as retail, education, manufacturing, energy, healthcare, and medical.\n\nWe deliver edge-optimized AI-enabled platforms for edge applications based on our Intel X eon, Intel Core, and Intel A tom processor portfolio, which reduces operational complexity for our customers and helps our customers create, store, and process data at the edge so they can analyze it faster and act on it sooner. We also build differentiated networking offerings that keep pace with industry speeds and deliver unique features needed for the intelligent edge, such as networking offloads, time-sensitive networking, and scalable reliable transport. \u00ae\n\nEnterprise Networking: Enterprises are evolving their networks to connect new and varying environments, host services from anywhere between cloud and edge, deliver heightened service levels, and handle growing volumes of devices and data. We are leading the world's shift to run networking workloads in software and create network function virtualization to provide our customers with more efficient, cost-effective, and programmable platforms that enable secure, agile, and reliable networking solutions from edge to cloud. We work with our ecosystem partners of over 500 network builders to help enterprises optimize their networks with right-siz ed compute and connectivity requirements for current and future needs.\n\nTelecommunication Networks: We lead 5G core network deployments, demonstrating that 5G base stations can be almost entirely built from software running on Intel X eon processors with Intel v RA N Boost. We continue to drive the transformation from fixed-function networks onto Intel X eon Scalable processors and Intel Xeon D processors coupled with our FlexCore and FlexRAN\u2122 software. Our customers are tier-one global communication service providers and their equipment suppliers. Our software-based cloud RAN platform is designed to allow operators to deploy the fastest cloud-native 5G infrastructure quickly and efficiently at scale to meet the needs of their end customers. \u00ae\n\nCloud Networking: Our cloud customers require uncompromised data center network performance and reliability driven by increased networking investments to support AI cluster deployments. We address these requirements by providing our open-standards-based NICs and IPUs. The IPU, a new class of product, is an open and programmable compute platform that frees up more compute cycles for customers by running infrastructure workloads in a separate, secure, and isolated set of CPU cores.\n\nMD&amp;A\n\n16",

      "answer": "In 2023, Intel's focus on xPU products was part of a broader R&D strategy that included process and packaging technology, AI, and software, with $16.0 billion spent on R&D. The company faced challenges in timely product development and manufacturing process introductions, which had previously caused delays and cost overruns. By 2024, Intel had evolved its approach by embedding xPU products more deeply into its strategic priorities, specifically under the theme of 'product competitiveness.' The company announced the creation of an advisory group to expand the x86 ecosystem and emphasized the xPU family of products\u2014including client and data center GPUs, IPUs, FPGAs, and other accelerators\u2014as a way to meet diverse computing needs. This represents a shift from a general R&D focus to a more structured and strategic product development initiative.",

          "chunk_text": "## Fundamentals of Our Business\n\nWe are a global designer and manufacturer of semiconductor products. The CPUs and other semiconductor solutions that we design, manufacture, market, and sell are incorporated in computing and related end products and services, and utilized globally by consumers, enterprises, governments, and educational organizations. Customers of our semiconductor products primarily include OEM s, ODM s, cloud service providers, and other manufacturers and service providers, such as industrial and communication equipment manufacturers and other cloud service providers who buy our products through distributor, reseller, retail, and OEM channels throughout the world. We market and sell our semiconductor products directly through our global sales and marketing organizations and indirectly through channel partners. We also develop semiconductor fabrication process and packaging technologies and manufacture many of our semiconductor product offerings at our geographically diverse network of fabrication and assembly and test facilities. We are also seeking to expand as a third-party foundry for external customers.\n\n## Our Strategy\n\nTechnology permeates every aspect of our lives and is increasingly central to every aspect of human existence. A s we look ahead to the next decade, we expect to see continued demand for processing power. Semiconductors are the underlying technology powering this digital expansion, and we are strategically positioning ourselves to create a resilient global semiconductor supply chain by investing in geographically balanced manufacturing capacity. The demand for compute is being accelerated by five superpowers: ubiquitous compute, pervasive connectivity, cloud-to-edge infrastructure, A I, and sensing. Together, these superpowers combine to amplify and reinforce each other, and increase the world's need for computing by packing even more processing capability onto ever-smaller microchips. We harness these superpowers for our customers' growth and our own.\n\nWe are uniquely positioned with the depth and breadth of our silicon, platforms, software, and packaging and process technology with at-scale manufacturing. With these strengths and the tailwinds of the superpowers driving digital disruption, our strategy to win is focused on four key themes: product competitiveness, open platforms, manufacturing at scale, and our people.\n\n## Our Priorities\n\n## Product Competitiv eness\n\nLead and democratize compute with Intel x86 and xPU. Our product offerings provide end-to-end solutions, scaling from data center to network, PCs, edge computing, and the emerging fields of A I and autonomous driving, to serve an increasingly smart and connected world.\n\nAt our core is the x86 ecosystem, which has served as a foundation of modern computing for over four decades. We continue to advance this ecosystem with x86 microarchitectures focused on performance and efficiency. In 2024, we announced the creation of an advisory group to expand the x86 ecosystem by enabling compatibility across platforms, simplifying software development, and providing developers with a platform to identify architectural needs and features to create innovative and scalable solutions for the future.\n\nBeyond the CPU, we deliver a family of xPU products encompassing client and data center GPUs, IPUs, FPGAs, and other accelerators. The xPU approach recognizes that different workloads benefit from different computing architectures, and our broad portfolio helps meet our customers' increasingly diverse computing needs. As part of our strategy, we seek to develop and offer leading products across each of these architectural categories.\n\nWe also seek to address every phase of the AI continuum, from the largest, most challenging GenA I and large language models to emerging usages like A I PCs and AI at the edge. We believe A I represents a generational shift in computing by expanding human abilities and solving the most challenging problems. We are in the early stages of realizing A I's full potential. Our strategy  is to bring A I to where the data is being generated and used. We believe we have a full spectrum of hardware and software platforms that offer the open and modular solutions for competitive total cost of ownership and time to value that customers need to win in this era of exponential growth and A I everywhere. We are infusing A I into Intel technologies, supporting today's GenA I workloads, fueling emerging usages like A I PC and AI at the edge, and pioneering innovations that we believe will help advance the future of A I in the next decade.\n\nOur product offerings are predominantly manufactured in our own manufacturing facilities using our proprietary process technologies. In recent years, however, we have strategically utilized third-party foundry manufacturing capacity where advantageous for cost, performance, schedule, or other reasons. This provides increased flexibility  and scale, including in recent y ears the ability  to continue to offer v arious products at the most performant end of the product spectrum where we did not yet have comparable process technologies in-house.\n\n## Open Platforms\n\nWe aim to deliver open software and hardware platforms with industry-defining standards. A round the globe, companies are building their networks, systems, and solutions on open standards-based platforms. We have helped set the stage for this movement, with our historic contributions in developing standards such as CXL, Thunderbolt\u2122, and PCI Express. We also contributed to the design, build, and validation of open-source products in the industry such as Linux, A ndroid, and others.\n\nOur Strategy\n\n3",

NVIDIA's unique end-to-end, software-defined approach is designed for continuous innovation and continuous development, enabling cars to receive over-the-air updates to add new features and capabilities throughout the life of a vehicle.\n\n## Business Strategies\n\nNVIDIA's key strategies that shape our overall business approach include:\n\nAdvancing  the  NVIDIA  accelerated  computing  platform. NVIDIA's  accelerated  computing  platform  can  solve complex  problems  in  significantly  less  time  and  with  lower  power  consumption  than  alternative  computational approaches. Indeed, it can help solve problems that were previously deemed unsolvable. We work to deliver continued performance leaps that outpace Moore's Law by leveraging innovation across the architecture, chip design, system, and  software  layers.  With  our  acquisition  of  Mellanox,  we  strengthened  our  end-to-end  expertise  in  data  center architectures, positioning us for a future when the data center is the new unit of computing. This full-stack innovation approach allows us to deliver order-of-magnitude performance advantages relative to legacy approaches in our target markets,  which  include  Gaming,  Data  Center,  Professional  Visualization,  and  Automotive.  While  the  computing requirements of these end markets are diverse, we address them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs and CUDA as the fundamental building blocks. The programmable nature of our architecture allows us to make leveraged  investments  in  R&amp;D:  we  can  support  several  multi-billion-dollar  end  markets  with  the  same  underlying technology by using a variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third party developers and partners. We utilize this platform approach in each of our target markets.\n\nExtending  our  technology  and  platform  leadership  in  AI. We  provide  a  complete,  end-to-end  accelerated computing platform for deep learning and machine learning, addressing both training and inferencing. This includes GPUs, interconnects, systems, our CUDA programming language, algorithms, libraries, and other software.

Further, growth of our software subscription offerings depends, in part, on the ability of customers to use and access these solutions. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, interruptions in service, storage failures, and other performance-related problems due to a variety of factors, such as infrastructure and software changes, human or software errors, capacity constraints, unauthorized access, denial of service or other cyber attacks. In some instances, we may not be able to timely identify the cause or causes of these performance problems and, even if timely identified, we may be unable to timely remediate the underlying cause. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our performance for our software subscription offerings, especially during peak usage times and as our solutions become more complex and our user traffic increases. Performance-related issues of our software subscription offerings may result in increased operational costs, delays in new feature rollouts, customer loss, reputational damage, and legal or regulatory liability, including liability under customer contracts or for losses suffered by our customers.\n\nTo deliver our software subscription offerings, we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial costs to implement and maintain this business. We make significant  investments  to  increase  or  maintain  capacity  and  to  develop  and  implement  new  technologies  in  our  infrastructure  and  operations,  including  those provided by third-party providers on which we rely. We may not be successful in developing or implementing these technologies. To the extent that we do not effectively scale our operations to meet the needs of our customers and to maintain performance as our customers expand their use of our solutions, we may not be able to grow this business as quickly as we anticipate, our customers may reduce or cancel use of our solutions, and we may be unable to compete as effectively and our business and results of operations may be harmed. Additionally, if our costs associated with our software subscription offerings were to significantly increase, our  business,  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition  may  be  negatively  impacted.  We  are  also  subject  to  the  risk  of  performance-related  problems  or interruption of the services provided by third-party providers on which we rely, which could cause revenues for software subscription offerings to decline, damage to our reputation, legal liability ex posure, and/or increased ex penses, all of which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\n## We depend upon the development of new products and services, and enhancements to existing products and services, and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers' changing needs, our operating results and market share may suffer.\n\nThe markets for our products and services are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, new product and service introductions, and evolving methods of building and operating networks. Our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products and services into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing products. If customers do not purchase and/or renew our offerings our business could be harmed.\n\nThe process of developing new technology, including more programmable, flexible and virtual networks, and technology related to other market transitions- such as artificial intelligence, security, observability, and cloud- is complex and uncertain, and if we fail to accurately predict customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed. We must commit significant resources, including the investments we have been making in our strategic priorities to developing new products and services before knowing whether our investments will result in products and services the market will accept. In particular, if our model of the evolution of networking, security, or observability does not emerge as we believe it will, or these industries do not evolve as we believe they will, or if our strategy for addressing this evolution is not successful, many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value. For example, if we do not introduce products related to these markets in a timely fashion, or if product offerings in this market that ultimately succeed are based on technology, or an approach to technology, that differs from ours, our business could be harmed. Similarly, our business could be harmed if we fail to develop, or fail to develop in a timely fashion, offerings to address other transitions, or if the offerings addressing these other transitions that ultimately succeed are based on technology, or an approach to technology, different from ours. In addition, our business could be negatively impacted in periods surrounding our new product introductions if customers delay purchasing decisions to qualify or otherwise evaluate the new product offerings. We have also been seeking to meet the evolving needs of customers which include offering our products and solutions in the manner in which customers wish to consume them. As a part of these efforts, we continue to make changes to how we are organized and how we build and deliver our technology, including changes in our business models with customers. If our strategy for addressing our customer needs, or the architectures and solutions we develop do not meet those needs, or the changes we are making in how we are organized and how we build and deliver or technology is incorrect or ineffective, our business could be harmed.\n\nFurthermore, we may not execute successfully on our vision or strategy because of challenges with regard to product planning and timing, technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion, or a lack of appropriate resources. This could result in competitors, some of which may also be our strategic alliance partners, providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share, revenue, and earnings. In addition, the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market. The success of new products and services depends on several factors, including proper new product and service definition, component costs, timely completion and introduction of these products and services, differentiation of new products and services from those of our competitors, and market acceptance of these products and",

The risks associated with our strategic alliances are more fully discussed in 'Item 1A. Risk Factors,' including the risk factor  entitled  'If  we  do  not  successfully  manage  our  strategic  alliances,  we  may  not  realize  the  expected  benefits  from  such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development.'\n\n## Competition\n\nWe compete in the networking and communications equipment markets, providing products and services designed to transport, and help secure data, voice, and video traffic across cloud, private and public networks and the Internet. These market factors represent a competitive threat to us. We compete with numerous vendors in each product category. The overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase. Also, the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity  in  newer  product  areas,  and  in  key  priority  and  growth  areas.  As  we  continue  to  expand  globally,  we  may  see  new competition in different geographic regions. In particular, we have experienced price-focused competition from competitors in Asia, especially from China, and we anticipate this will continue.\n\nOur  competitors  (in  each  case  relative  to  only  some  of  our  products  or  services)  include: Amazon  Web  Services  LLC; Arista Networks, Inc.; Broadcom Inc.; Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.; Ciena Corporation; CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.; Datadog Inc.; Dell Technologies Inc.; Dynatrace Inc.; Fortinet, Inc.; Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Company; Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.; Juniper Networks, Inc.; Microsoft Corporation; New Relic, Inc.; Nokia Corporation; Palo Alto Networks, Inc.; RingCentral, Inc.; Ubiquiti Inc.; VMware, Inc.; Zoom Video Communications, Inc.; and Zscaler, Inc.; among others.\n\nSome of our competitors compete across many of our product lines, while others are primarily focused in a specific product area. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed. In addition, some of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do.  As  we  expand  into  new  markets,  we  will  face  competition  not  only  from  our  existing  competitors  but  also  from  other competitors,  including  existing  companies  with  strong  technological,  marketing,  and  sales  positions  in  those  markets.  We  also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products. Companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas, and this trend may increase. For example, the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies, including computing, networking, storage, and software, that  previously  were  segregated.  Due  to  several  factors,  including  the  availability  of  highly  scalable  and  general  purpose microprocessors,  application-specific  integrated  circuits  (ASICs)  offering  advanced  services,  standards-based  protocols,  cloud computing and virtualization, the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple, previously independent, technology segments. Also, some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions, or announced new strategic alliances, designed to position them to provide end-to-end technology solutions for the enterprise data center. As a result of all of these developments, we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies, including competition from entities that are among our long-term strategic alliance partners. Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us.\n\nThe principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include the ability to sell successful business outcomes; the ability to provide a broad range of networking and communications products and services; product performance; price; the ability to introduce new products, including providing continuous new customer value and products with  price-performance  advantages;  the  ability  to  reduce  production  costs;  the  ability  to  provide  value-added  features  such  as security, reliability,  and  investment protection; conformance to standards; market presence; the ability to provide financing; and disruptive technology shifts and new business models.\n\nWe  also  face  competition  from  customers  to  which  we  license  or  supply  technology  and  suppliers  from  which  we  transfer technology. The inherent nature of networking requires interoperability. As such, we must cooperate and, at the same time, compete with many companies. Any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers, suppliers, and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success.",

In a multicloud environment, customers have to reimagine how they design, develop and deploy their applications. They need to be able to build applications quickly, deploy them nearly anywhere, monitor experiences, and act in real time.\n\nWe  believe  we  are  uniquely  positioned  to  enable  successful  business  outcomes  for  customers  in  hybrid  and  multicloud environments. In our view, networks are increasingly critical to business success and we believe our customers will benefit from the insights and intelligence that we are making accessible through our highly differentiated platforms.\n\nWe  are  continuing  our  commitment  to  deliver  full  stack  observability  from  the  application  to  the  infrastructure  to  give  our customers  greater  insights  that  enable  faster,  better  decision  making.  We  are  doing  this  through  adding  key  elements  to  our portfolio, such as: infrastructure optimization with Intersight, network monitoring with technology from ThousandEyes, application performance monitoring with AppDynamics, as well as our security innovations.\n\n## Power Hybrid Work\n\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic began, the world has shifted to a hybrid work environment, and we believe that our customers are looking  to  support  a  blend  of  onsite  and  offsite  workers.  To  enable  a  hybrid  workforce,  customers  require  secure  access, collaboration, and technologies to empower their teams to connect seamlessly and to work from anywhere.\n\nCustomers are looking to us to help improve how their people communicate, collaborate and to increase productivity. At Cisco, we are focused on providing and delivering highly secure collaboration experiences to help our customers create a secure hybrid work environment.\n\nWe  believe  our  collaboration  portfolio,  which  includes  our  subscription-based  Webex  conferencing  platform,  with  meetings, devices,  calling  and  messaging,  is  at  the  center  of  our  customers'  strategy  for  enabling  their  teams  to  be  more  productive  and secure. To help our customers transform their workplaces, we continue to invest to expand our capabilities by introducing new Webex Calling innovations in the Webex Suite to improve work flexibility, reliability, and quality. Additionally, we also launched new devices for hybrid work - the Webex Room Bar and a Cisco Video Phone.\n\n## Transform Infrastructure\n\nIn an increasingly digital and connected world, where each new connection to the Internet puts more demand on the network, our customers are looking to modernize and transform their infrastructure in an automated way in order to manage and monitor each connection in real time. Our strategy to help our customers transform their infrastructure with the network at the core began with Software-Defined Access (SD-Access) technology, one of our leading enterprise architectures, and continued with the launch of our Catalyst 9000 series of switches.\n\nWe  have  continued  to  transform  our  enterprise  access  portfolio  by  bringing  together  several  technologies  to  form  the  only integrated architecture with built-in simplicity, automation and security at the foundation. This architecture is designed to enable our customers to securely connect their users and devices to applications and data over any network, no matter where they are.\n\nWe  have  introduced  several  innovations  that  extend  our  networking  capabilities  to  wireless  and  enterprise  routing  products, including Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) and Internet of Things (IoT) edge platforms. Our SD-WAN solutions are designed to provide direct branch to cloud connectivity, enabling the workforce to access their software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications  and  workloads  in  an  optimized  and  highly  secure  manner.  We  have  continued  to  expand  our  SD-WAN  offering, through  our  Cloud  OnRamp  integrations  with  several  webscale  providers  to  deliver  predictable  and  highly  secure  application experiences.\n\nTo further our innovation in this area, we are applying the latest technologies, such as machine learning and advanced analytics, to operate  and  enhance  network  capabilities.  These  network  product  offerings  are  designed  to  help  enable  customers  to  detect cybersecurity threats, even in encrypted traffic. As such, we have created, in our view, the only network that is designed for security while also helping to maintain privacy.\n\nOur customers are operating in multicloud environments with private, public and hybrid clouds. For the data center, our strategy is to deliver multicloud architectures that bring policy and operational consistency, regardless of where applications or data reside, by extending our Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) and our hyperconverged offerings. We continue to invest in our data center portfolio  to  help  meet  the  growing  demand  for  cloud-delivered  technologies.

      "question": "How has Cisco's exposure to channel partner financing guarantees evolved between fiscal years 2022 and 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's financial risk management strategy?",
      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Cisco disclosed that the volume of channel partner financing was $27.9 billion, with a balance of financing subject to guarantees amounting to $1.4 billion as of July 30, 2022. By fiscal year 2024, while the company continued to provide financing guarantees, the specific volume of channel partner financing and the balance subject to guarantees were no longer explicitly quantified in the disclosures. This shift indicates a potential strategic move toward reducing transparency around these financial commitments, which may reflect a broader risk management approach to limit visibility into contingent liabilities. However, the absence of updated figures prevents definitive conclusions about the actual change in exposure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 \u2014 In 2022, Cisco disclosed specific figures for channel partner financing volume ($27.9 billion) and the balance subject to guarantees ($1.4 billion).",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 \u2014 In 2024, Cisco still disclosed the existence of financing guarantees but omitted the specific dollar amounts related to channel partner financing, unlike the prior disclosure.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change \u2014 The removal of detailed quantitative exposure in 2024 suggests a change in disclosure strategy, potentially signaling a shift in how the company manages and communicates financial risk associated with these guarantees."

Payments under these financing guarantee arrangements were not material for the periods presented.\n\nChannel  Partner  Financing  Guarantees      We  facilitate  arrangements  for  third-party  financing  extended  to  channel  partners, consisting  of  revolving  short-term  financing,  with  payment  terms  generally  ranging  from  60  to  90  days.  These  financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and, in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements.

Purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations.\n\nLong-Term Debt The  amount  of  long-term  debt  in  the  preceding  table  represents  the  principal  amount  of  the  respective  debt  instruments.  See  Note  12  to  the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nTransition Tax Payable Transition tax payable represents future cash tax payments associated with the one-time U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings for foreign subsidiaries as a result of the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act ('the Tax  Act').\n\nOther Long-Term Liabilities Other long-term liabilities primarily include noncurrent income tax es payable, accrued liabilities for deferred compensation, deferred tax liabilities, and certain other long-term liabilities. Due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments, our noncurrent income tax es payable of approximately $1.7 billion and deferred tax liabilities of $76 million were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table. Noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Other Commitments\n\nIn connection with our acquisitions, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our privately held investments. The funding commitments were $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion as of July 27, 2024 and July 29, 2023, respectively.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we have privately held investments and provide financing to certain customers. Certain of these investments are considered to be variable interest entities. We evaluate on an ongoing basis our privately held investments and customer financings, and we have determined that as of July 27, 2024 there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities.\n\nOn an ongoing basis, we reassess our privately held investments and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance. As a result of this ongoing assessment, we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities. Because we may not control these entities, we may not have the ability to influence these events.\n\nWe provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners. See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under 'Financing Receivables and Guarantees.'\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements\n\nBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically, including the following: working capital needs (including inventory and other supply related payments), capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, pending acquisitions, future customer financings, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. There are no other transactions, arrangements, or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of, as well as our requirements for, capital resources.",

License support contracts provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period and include internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net cloud license and on-premise license fees. Substantially all of our customers elect to purchase and renew their license support contracts annually.\n\nCloud  services  revenues  include  revenues  from  Oracle  Cloud  Services  offerings,  which  deliver  applications  and  infrastructure technologies via cloud-based deployment models that we develop functionality for, provide unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploy, host, manage, upgrade and support and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period.\n\nCloud license and on-premise license revenues primarily represent amounts earned from granting customers perpetual licenses to use our database, middleware, application and industry-specific software products, which our customers use for cloud-based, onpremise and other IT environments. The vast majority of our cloud license and on-premise license arrangements include license support contracts, which are entered into at the customer's option.\n\nRevenues from the sale of hardware products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of our Oracle Engineered Systems, computer  servers,  storage,  and  industry-specific  hardware.

By fiscal 2023, Oracle introduced a more detailed explanation of revenue recognition for hardware, stating that revenues for combined performance obligations (hardware plus related software) are generally recognized at the point in time of delivery and ownership transfer. Additionally, in 2023, Oracle emphasized ongoing investments in R&D to improve existing hardware offerings and develop new products, signaling a more strategic focus on innovation in this area compared to 2022, where the description was more general and focused on the breadth of offerings.",

      "question": "How has Oracle's strategic positioning of Engineered Systems evolved between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of their role within the hardware business and implications for Oracle's cloud transformation narrative?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Oracle Engineered Systems were described as pre-integrated products central to both cloud and on-premise data center infrastructure, emphasizing their technical advantages such as improved performance, scalability, and simplified maintenance. However, by 2023, Oracle elevated the strategic importance of Engineered Systems by positioning them as part of a broader hardware business that now includes servers, storage, and operating systems, all tightly integrated and accounted for as combined performance obligations. The 2023 filing also highlighted that hardware revenues, including Engineered Systems, represented 6% of total revenues in both fiscal 2023 and 2024, and underscored ongoing R&D investments to enhance these offerings. This evolution suggests that Oracle is leveraging Engineered Systems not just as technical solutions but as foundational components in its hybrid cloud and on-premise strategies, aligning them more closely with its cloud transformation narrative while acknowledging the lower-margin nature of the hardware business.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Engineered Systems were described as pre-integrated, high-performance infrastructure products with an emphasis on technical benefits and deployment flexibility (on-premise, cloud, hybrid).",
        "Step 2: In 2023, Engineered Systems were embedded within a broader hardware business strategy, with emphasis on integration with software components, combined performance obligations, and their role in Oracle\u2019s hybrid cloud offerings. The hardware business represented 6% of total revenues in both fiscal 2023 and 2024.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a transformation in strategic positioning\u2014Engineered Systems are now more tightly aligned with Oracle's cloud transformation and hybrid infrastructure offerings, with increased focus on long-term R&D and customer support."

Oracle Middleware is designed to enable  customers  to  design  and  integrate  Oracle  and  non-Oracle  business  applications,  automate  business  processes,  scale applications  to  meet  customer  demand,  simplify  security  and  compliance,  manage  lifecycles  of  documents  and  get  actionable, targeted  business  intelligence.  Built  with  Oracle's  Java  technology  platform,  Oracle  Middleware  products  are  designed  to  be flexible  across  different  deployment  environments-cloud,  on-premise  or  hybrid-as  a  foundation  for  custom,  packaged  and composite applications, thereby simplifying and reducing time to deployment. Oracle Middleware is designed to protect customers' IT  investments  and  work  with  both  Oracle  and  non-Oracle  database,  middleware  and  applications  software  through  an  open architecture  and  adherence  to  industry  standards.  In  addition,  Oracle  Middleware  supports  multiple  development  languages  and tools, which enables developers to flexibly build once and deploy applications globally across websites, portals and cloud-based applications utilizing a variety of IT environments.\n\nAmong our other middleware license offerings, we license development tools, such as Oracle WebLogic Server for Java application development, and Oracle Identity Manager, which automates user identity provisioning and allows enterprises to manage the endto-end lifecycle of user identities across all enterprise resources. Organizations may elect to purchase license support, as described above, for Oracle Middleware licenses at their option. We also offer certain of our middleware capabilities as a part of our OCI offerings.\n\n## Java Licenses\n\nJava  is  the  world's  most  popular  programming  language  that  is  used  to  deliver  cloud  development  and  deployment  services, microservices,  analytics,  data  management,  blockchain,  security,  and  continuous  integration  tools  for  numerous  platforms  and technologies including websites, enterprise and consumer applications, embedded devices and large-scale systems. Java is designed to enable developers to write software on a single platform and run it on many other different platforms, independent of operating system  and  hardware  architecture.  Java  has  been  adopted  by  both  independent  software  vendors  (ISVs)  that  have  built  their products using Java and by enterprise organizations building custom applications or consuming Java-based ISV products. Oracle is the steward of the Java platform and ecosystem. Customers generally purchase Java offerings through subscriptions that include licenses and support services. Oracle's Java offerings are used by customers to support their Java deployments and to stay current with the latest security updates and other technology innovations.\n\n## Oracle Infrastructure Technologies - Hardware Business Offerings\n\nOracle infrastructure technologies are also marketed, sold and delivered through our hardware business, including a broad selection of hardware products and related hardware support services to power cloud-based and on-premise IT environments.\n\n## Oracle Engineered Systems\n\nOracle  Engineered  Systems  are  core  to  our  cloud-based  and  on-premise  data  center  infrastructure  offerings.  Oracle  Engineered Systems  are  pre-integrated  products,  combining  multiple  unique  Oracle  technology  components,  including  database,  storage, operating system, and management software with server, storage, networking hardware and other technologies. Oracle Engineered Systems are designed to work together to deliver improved performance, scalability, availability, security and operational efficiency relative  to  our  competitors'  products;  to  be  upgraded  effectively  and  efficiently  in  a  non-disruptive  manner;  and  to  simplify maintenance  cycles  and  improve  security  by  providing  a  single  solution  for  patching.  For  example,  Oracle  Exadata  Database Machine is an integrated platform that is optimized for running Oracle Database, achieving higher performance, scalability and availability at a lower cost by combining Oracle Database, storage and operating system software with Oracle server, storage and networking hardware. We offer certain of our Oracle Engineered Systems, including the Oracle Exadata Database Machine, among others, through flexible deployment options, including on-premise, as a cloud offering in OCI, and as a hybrid cloud offering in customer data centers.",

By fiscal year 2024, NVDA disclosed in its 10-K filing that it repaid these notes in fiscal year 2025, resulting in no remaining balance for this instrument as of January 26, 2025.

We may redeem each of our notes prior to maturity, subject to a make-whole premium. The maturity of the notes is calendar year.\n\nAs of January 26, 2025, we complied with the required covenants, which are non-financial in nature, under the outstanding notes.\n\n## Commercial Paper\n\nWe have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of January 26, 2025, we had no commercial paper outstanding.\n\n## Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies\n\n## Purchase Obligations\n\nOur  purchase  obligations  reflect  our  commitment  to  purchase  components  used  to  manufacture  our  products,  including  long-term  supply  and  capacity agreements, certain software and technology licenses, other goods and services and long-lived assets.\n\nAs of January 26, 2025, we had outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations totaling $30.8 billion, an increase from the prior year led by commitments, capacity and components for new product introductions, including our new Blackwell architecture. We enter into agreements with contract manufacturers that allow them to procure inventory based upon our defined criteria, and in certain instances, these agreements are cancellable, able to be rescheduled, or adjustable for our business needs prior to placing firm orders. Though, changes to these agreements may result in additional costs. Other non-inventory purchase obligations were $14.3 billion, including $10.9 billion of multi-year cloud service agreements. We expect our cloud service agreements to primarily be used to support our research and development efforts, as well as our DGX  Cloud offerings.\n\n## NVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated F inancial Statements\n\n(Continued)",

We may redeem each of our notes prior to maturity, subject to a make-whole premium. The maturity of the notes is calendar year.\n\nAs of January 26, 2025, we complied with the required covenants, which are non-financial in nature, under the outstanding notes.\n\n## Commercial Paper\n\nWe have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes.

We enter into agreements with contract manufacturers that allow them to procure inventory based upon our defined criteria, and in certain instances, these agreements are cancellable, able to be rescheduled, or adjustable for our business needs prior to placing firm orders. Though, changes to these agreements may result in additional costs. Other non-inventory purchase obligations were $14.3 billion, including $10.9 billion of multi-year cloud service agreements. We expect our cloud service agreements to primarily be used to support our research and development efforts, as well as our DGX  Cloud offerings.\n\n## NVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated F inancial Statements\n\n(Continued)",

      "answer": "In 2023, NVDA highlighted that pollution limits and related climate regulations could increase direct and indirect costs, including compliance, energy, and capital expenditures, and could require changes to manufacturing processes and supply chain operations. By 2024, the company expanded its concern to include not only cost increases but also the potential for land and permitting constraints tied to pollution limits, which could impair customers' ability to expand data center capacity\u2014an essential market for NVDA's products. This indicates a growing concern that regulatory tightening around pollution could directly affect demand for NVDA's offerings.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, NVDA identified pollution limits as part of a broader set of climate-related regulations that could increase costs and require operational changes.",

        "Step 3: The evolution from a general cost and compliance concern in 2023 to a more specific and operationally impactful risk in 2024 reflects a heightened and more direct concern about pollution limits affecting business outcomes."

For example, other countries have restricted and may continue in the future to restrict business with the State of Israel, where we have engineering, sales support operations and manufacturing, and companies with Israeli operations, including by economic boycotts. Our operations could be harmed and our costs could increase if manufacturing, logistics, or other operations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters,  high  heat  events,  water  shortages,  power  shortages,  information  technology  system  failures  or  cyber-attacks,  military  actions  or  economic,  and business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers of being located and consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a disaster, war, or catastrophic event affects us, the third-party systems on which we rely , or our customers, our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, and substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations. Our business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. A ll of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results.\n\nWe are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the health and safety of our approximately 4,700 employees in the region who primarily support the research and development, operations, and sales and marketing of our networking products. Some of our employees in the region have been on active military duty for an extended period and may continue to be absent, which may cause disruption to our product development or operations. We have not experienced significant impact or expense to our business; however, if the conflict is further extended or expanded, it could impact future product development, operations, and revenue or create other uncertainty for our business.\n\nAdditionally , interruptions or delay s in serv ices from CSPs, data center co-location partners, and other third parties on which we rely , including due to the events described above or other events such as the insolvency of these parties, could impair our ability to provide our products and services and harm our business. A s we increase our reliance on these third-party systems and services, our exposure to damage from service interruptions, defects, disruptions, outages, shortages and other performance and quality problems may increase. Data centers depend on access to clean water and predictable energy . Power or water shortages, land or permitting constraints, or regulations that limit energy , water, or land availability , could impair the ability of our customers to expand their data center capacity and consume our products and services, which may in turn negatively impact our business.\n\n## Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\n\nClimate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and on our customers, partners and vendors. Water and energy availability and reliability  in the regions where we conduct business is critical, and certain of our facilities may be vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events. Extreme heat and wind coupled with dry conditions in Northern California may lead to power safety shut offs due to wildfire risk, which can have adverse implications for our Santa Clara, California headquarter offices and data centers, including impairing the ability of our employees to work effectively . Climate change, its impact on our supply chain and critical infrastructure worldwide and its potential to increase political instability in regions where we, our customers, partners and our vendors do business, may disrupt our business and cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and costs to maintain or resume operations. A lthough we maintain insurance coverage for a variety of property , casualty , and other risks, the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability and cost. Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions, and our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nOur business and those of our suppliers and customers may also be subject to climate-related laws, regulations and lawsuits. New or proposed regulations relating to carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, pollution limits, sustainability-related disclosure and governance and supply chain governance could result in greater direct costs, including costs associated with changes to manufacturing processes or the procurement of raw materials used in manufacturing processes, increased capital expenditures to improve facilities and equipment, higher compliance and energy costs to reduce emissions, other compliance costs, and greater indirect costs resulting from our customers and/or suppliers incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs and restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our operations and product design activities.\n\nStakeholder groups may find us insufficiently responsive to the implications of climate change, and therefore we may face legal action or reputational harm. We may not achieve our stated sustainability-related goals, which could harm our reputation, or we may incur additional, unexpected costs to achieve such goals. We may also experience contractual disputes due to supply chain delays arising from climate change-related disruptions, which could result in increased litigation and costs.\n\nWe also face risks related to business trends that may be influenced by climate change concerns. Our business could be negatively impacted by concerns around the high absolute energy requirements of our GPUs, despite their much more energy efficient design and operation relative to alternative computing platforms.\n\nWe may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired companies, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products.",

          "chunk_text": "As of December 25, 2021, the fair value of our marketable equity securities was $2.2 billion ($1.8 billion as of December 26, 2020). The substantial majority of our marketable equity securities portfolio as of December 25, 2021 was concentrated in securities traded on the Chinese Shanghai Stock Exchange Science and Technology Innovation Board. To determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity securities, we have analyzed the historical market price sensitivity of our portfolio. Assuming a decline of 60% in market prices, the aggregate value of our marketable equity securities could decrease by approximately $1.3 billion, based on the value as of December 25, 2021 (a decrease in value of approximately $1.1 billion, based on the value as of December 26, 2020 using an assumed decline of 60%).\n\nWe utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. Gains or losses from changes in fair value of these total return swaps are generally offset by the losses or gains on the related liabilities.\n\nMany of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non-marketable equity investments, although we cannot always quantify the impacts directly. Financial markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. These types of investments involve a great deal of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful; consequently, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our non-marketable equity securities had a carrying amount of $4.1 billion as of December 25, 2021 ($3.3 billion as of December 26, 2020) and includes our investment in Beijing Unisoc Technology Ltd. of $1.1 billion ($658 million as of December 26, 2020).\n\n## Commodity Price Risk\n\nAlthough we operate facilities that consume commodities, we are not directly affected by commodity price risk to a material degree. We have established forecasted transaction risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in commodity prices. We may use commodity derivatives contracts, such as commodity swaps, in these hedging programs. In addition, we have sourcing plans in place that are designed to mitigate the risk of a potential supplier concentration for our key commodities.\n\n## Risk Factors\n\nWhen any one or more of the following risks materialize from time to time, our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations can be materially and adversely affected, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations can also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Refer also to the other information set forth in this Form 10-K, including in the MD&amp;A and Financial Statements and Supplemental Details sections.\n\n## Changes in product demand can adversely affect our financial results.\n\nDemand for our products is variable and hard to predict. Our products are used in different market segments, and demand for our products varies within or among them. It is difficult to forecast these changes and their impact. For example, we expect the PC TAM to grow over time driven by factors such as a larger installed base, new platforms, shorter replacement cycles, and adoption in new markets; however, the PC industry has been highly cyclical in the past, and these growth expectations may not materialize or we may fail to capitalize on them. Changes in the demand for our products, particularly our CCG and DCG platform products, can reduce our revenue, lower our gross margin, or require us to write down the value of our assets.\n\nImportant factors that lead to variation in the demand for our products include:\n\n- business conditions, including downturns in the market segments in which we operate, or in global or regional economies;\n- consumer confidence, income levels, and customer capital spending, which can be impacted by changes in market conditions, including changes in government borrowing or spending, taxation, interest rates, the credit market, current or expected inflation, employment, and energy or other commodity prices;\n- geopolitical conditions, including trade policies;\n- our ability to timely introduce competitive products;\n- competitive and pricing pressures, including new product introductions and other actions taken by competitors;\n- the level of our customers' inventories and computing capacity;\n- customer order patterns and order cancellations, including as a result of maturing product cycles for our products, customers' products, and related products such as operating system upgrade cycles; and disruptions affecting customers, such as the ongoing industry substrate and component shortages that negatively impacted demand across several of our businesses in 2021;\n- market acceptance and industry support of our products, including the introduction and availability of software and other products used together with our products; and\n- customer product needs and emerging technology trends, including changes in the levels and nature of customer and end-user computing workloads, such as work- and learn-from-home trends.\n\nOther Key Information\n\n50",

Our product portfolio covers the entire stack required for assisted and autonomous driving, including compute platforms, computer vision and machine learning-based sensing, mapping and localization, driving policy, and active sensors in development. Mobileye's unique assets in ADAS allow for building a scalable self-driving stack that meets the requirements for both Robotaxi and consumer level autonomy. Our customers and strategic partners include major global OEMs, Tier 1 automotive system integrators, and public transportation operators.\n\n## Key Developments\n\n- \u25a0 We achieved record revenue in 2021 as global vehicle production improved amid recovery from the economic impacts of COVID-19. Our EyeQ SoC volume grew 42% and we expect to see additional growth in the adoption of enhanced ADAS technologies. We have shipped over 100 million chips to date, including 28 million EyeQ SoCs in 2021.\n- \u25a0 We secured a record 41 new ADAS design wins, including deals with major OEMs such as Toyota, VW, BMW, Nissan, Honda, and PSA Group. We are currently active in 71 production programs  across over 30 OEMs. 1\n- \u25a0 We launched our SAE L4 SDS, Mobileye Drive\u2122, and secured multiple collaborations for commercial use, including with Udelv for autonomous cargo delivery, and with Transdev for selfdriving mobility services. We also achieved our first consumer L4 design win with Geely.\n- \u25a0 We unveiled the Mobileye Robotaxi, a production-grade self-driving electric vehicle, with mobility rider services and MaaS platform, as well as mobility intelligence, tele-operations and data services by Moovit. Through the partnership with SIXT, Robotaxi services will begin in Germany in 2022, along with the already announced Robotaxi services in Tel Aviv.\n- \u25a0 In December 2021, we announced our intention to take Mobileye public in the US via an IPO of newly issued Mobileye stock. Intel expects to retain majority ownership of Mobileye following the completion of the IPO.\n\n## 5-Year Trends 2\n\n## Market and Business Overview\n\n## Market Trends and Strategy\n\nWhile the vehicle industry shows recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic with approximately 2% growth year over year, production is still roughly 15% below 2019 levels. We expect ADAS volume to overcome the COVID-19 effects faster than overall global vehicle production, given the significant growth shown in 2021. We anticipate long-term ADAS growth from a strong build-up in L1-L2 ADAS fitment rates, increasing the number of vehicles that will have basic ADAS features from the factory. In addition, we expect increased demand for new generations of cloud-enhanced ADAS as OEMs continue to look to boost current L2 solutions by improving system fidelity, availability, and performance. A crucial building block for L4 autonomy, our REM highdefinition maps with constant updates, global coverage, and crowd-based semantics provide a unique value proposition for enhanced L2 systems. We see great traction from leading OEMs (including VW and Ford, as recently announced) as REM-based enhancements can be achieved based on economical configuration. 3\n\nWe believe the future of autonomous driving will unfold in two phases: commercial services like Robotaxi and cargo, followed by series-production passenger car consumer AVs. We expect consumer AVs to materialize only after the Robotaxi industry deploys and matures. The main inhibitors of a mass market product offering of consumer AV are the cost of AV technology, ability to scale at a low cost, regulatory framework, public acceptance, and the ability to scale geographically. Thus, we see the Robotaxi phase as a necessary corridor to consumer AV. Because of our scalable approach, Mobileye is well-positioned to play a significant role in both the Robotaxi market and the future consumer AV market. This is driven by three elements in our strategy: lean compute enabled by the tight co-design of hardware and software, REM crowdsourced maps that provide unparalleled global coverage and constant updates, and development of high-resolution imaging radars to reduce the use of costly LiDAR sensors.\n\n- This refers to the total number of production programs with active project managers.

Delivering on our IDM 2.0 strategy and growth ambitions requires attracting, developing, and retaining top talent from across the world. We are committed to creating an inclusive workplace where the world's best engineers and technologists can fulfill their dreams and create technology that improves the life of every person on the planet. We invest in our highly skilled workforce of 121,100 people through creating practices, programs and benefits that support the evolving world of work and our employees' needs.\n\nFostering a culture of empowerment, inclusion, and accountability is also core to our IDM 2.0 strategy. We are focused on reinvigorating our culture to strengthen our execution and accelerate our cadence of innovation. Our values-customer first, fearless innovation, results driven, one Intel, inclusion, quality, and integrity-inspire us and are key to delivering on our purpose. This year, we added a new value-results driven-as we seek to return to our roots of innovation and execution, making data-driven decisions quickly and setting disciplined goals that drive business results. All employees are responsible for upholding these values, the Intel Code of Conduct, and Intel's Global Human Rights Principles, which form the foundation of our policies and practices and ethical business culture.\n\n\"At Intel we tackle hard problems, think boldly, and create technology that improves the life of every person on the planet. Our culture unleashes the diverse perspectives, experiences, and potential of our employees to drive innovation and business results for Intel and our customers.\"\n\n-Christy Pambianchi , Executive Vice President and Chief People Officer\n\n## Talent Management\n\nThe digitization of everything is driving growth and global demand for semiconductors. Combined with the tightening labor market and economic recovery from COVID-19, this has driven a significant increase in competition throughout the industry to attract and retain talent - especially technical talent. In 2021, we intensified our efforts to continue to attract and retain talent, including introducing new employee referral programs, expanding wellness benefits and time off, heightening our focus on revitalizing our culture, and increasing mentoring in our technical community. In 2021, our undesired turnover rate  was 5.6%, compared to 4.0% in 2020. 1\n\nWe invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to remain at the forefront of innovation and make Intel an employer of choice. We offer extensive training programs and provide rotational assignment opportunities. We evolved our performance management system to support our culture evolution and increase our focus on disciplined goal setting and results. Through our annual Employee Experience Surveys and Manager Development Feedback Surveys, employees can voice their perceptions of the company, their managers, their work experience, and learning and development opportunities.\n\n## Inclusion\n\nDiversity and inclusion are core to Intel's values and instrumental to driving innovation and positioning us for growth. Over the past decade, we have taken actions to integrate diversity and inclusion expectations into our culture, performance and management systems, leadership expectations, and annual bonus metrics. We are proud of what we have accomplished to advance diversity and inclusion, but we recognize we still have work to do, including beyond the walls of Intel. We also recognize the additional challenges that COVID-19 has presented to our employees, including women and individuals with disabilities. Our RISE strategy and 2030 goals set our global ambitions for the rest of the decade, including doubling the number of women in senior leadership; doubling the number of underrepresented minorities in US senior leadership; and embedding inclusive leadership practices across our business. Our goals also include increasing the percentage of employees who self-identify as having a disability to 10%; and exceeding 40% representation of women in technical roles, including engineering positions and other roles with technical job requirements. To drive accountability, we continue to link a portion of our executive and employee compensation to diversity and inclusion metrics.\n\nWe have committed our scale, expertise, and reach through our comprehensive RISE strategy to work with customers and other stakeholders to accelerate the adoption of inclusive business practices across industries. In 2021, we partnered with other technology companies to launch the Alliance for Global Inclusion to create and implement an Inclusion Index with unified goals and metrics. This collective effort will allow the industry to more clearly identify actions needed to advance progress on closing persistent gaps and advancing more inclusive practices in workplaces, industry, and society. We will also continue to collaborate on initiatives that expand the diverse pipeline of talent for our industry, advance social equity, make technology fully inclusive, and expand digital readiness for millions of people around the world.",

      "question": "What does IBM's continued listing of the 0.875% Notes due 2030 in 2024 alongside the new 2.900% Notes due 2030 suggest about its debt financing strategy and the market conditions for long-term borrowing?",
      "answer": "In 2023, IBM listed the 0.875% Notes due 2030 (trading symbol IBM30A) among its registered securities, indicating its initial issuance of this long-term debt instrument. By 2024, IBM not only maintained the 0.875% Notes due 2030 in its capital structure but also introduced a new 2.900% Notes due 2030 (trading symbol IBM30C). The significant increase in the interest rate\u2014from 0.875% to 2.900%\u2014for the same maturity year suggests that IBM may have pursued additional financing in 2024 under less favorable interest rate conditions, or it may be targeting different investor segments with varied risk-return profiles. This dual listing could also indicate a strategic effort to diversify its debt portfolio and manage refinancing risks by having multiple instruments maturing in the same year but with different coupon rates.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, IBM listed the 0.875% Notes due 2030 (IBM30A) as part of its registered debt instruments, showing its initial issuance of this long-term note.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, IBM continued to list the 0.875% Notes due 2030 and added a new 2.900% Notes due 2030 (IBM30C), indicating a new issuance targeting the same maturity horizon but with a significantly higher coupon.",
        "Step 3: The introduction of a higher-yielding instrument for the same maturity suggests a shift in IBM's financing strategy or reflects changing market conditions, such as rising interest rates, that impacted borrowing costs."

      "answer": "In the 2023 filing, the 0.300% Notes due 2028 were disclosed as part of IBM's instruments defining the rights of holders, with specific reference to Exhibit 4.1, filed on February 10, 2020. In the 2024 filing, the 0.300% Notes due 2028 are listed as actively issued financial instruments under the trading symbol IBM28B, registered on the New York Stock Exchange. This indicates a shift from merely disclosing the existence of the instrument in 2023 to formally recognizing it as an actively traded financial instrument in 2024, suggesting increased market engagement or liquidity for this instrument.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, the 0.300% Notes due 2028 were referenced in the context of incorporated exhibits defining holder rights, specifically Exhibit 4.1 filed in 2020.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the same instrument (0.300% Notes due 2028) is listed as a formally issued and traded financial instrument under the symbol IBM28B on the NYSE.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a transition from a passive disclosure of rights to active market participation, indicating a strategic or financial shift in how IBM is managing or presenting this instrument."

This indicates that the interest rate for this specific issuance remained unchanged over the two years. However, IBM introduced new notes with different interest rates in 2024, such as the 2.900% Notes due 2030 and the 3.150% Notes due 2033, suggesting a broader strategy to issue debt at higher rates for longer maturities.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the PWCC Plan was described as being used solely to fund awards for employees of PwCC who joined IBM after the acquisition, and it was stated that the plan would continue to be used for this purpose. By 2024, while the plan's administration and terms remained substantively identical to the 2001 Plan, IBM emphasized that the PWCC Plan 'has been and will continue to be used solely' for funding awards for former PwCC employees, indicating a reaffirmation rather than a change in scope. However, the shift in language from 'has been and will continue to be' in 2022 to a more definitive tone in 2024 suggests a stronger commitment to maintaining the plan\u2019s current usage without expansion.",

      "answer": "In 2022, IBM described stock exchange regulations as one of several factors influencing the value of its debt securities, placing it among other external variables beyond the company's control. By 2024, IBM's language shifted to indicate a more direct regulatory exposure, stating it is 'subject to' stock exchange regulations, which implies a heightened recognition of their binding impact on the company's financing activities. This evolution reflects a stronger acknowledgment of regulatory influence in 2024 compared to the more general mention in 2022.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, IBM characterized stock exchange regulations as one of many fluctuation factors for debt securities, indicating a passive relationship where the company was dependent on external conditions.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, IBM explicitly stated being 'subject to' stock exchange regulations, signaling a stronger recognition of direct regulatory oversight affecting its debt instruments.",
        "Step 3: The shift from 'influencing factor' to 'subject to' indicates a transformation in the nature of IBM's relationship with stock exchange regulations, suggesting increased regulatory burden or compliance emphasis over time."

The value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The company's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this Item 1A. entitled 'Risk Factors.' There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.\n\nThe company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of IBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item 1A. entitled 'Risk Factors,' as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. Since the market price of IBM's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices.\n\nIn addition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. The company does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities.\n\n## Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments:\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## Item 2. Properties:\n\nIBM's corporate headquarters are located at an owned site in Armonk, New York. As of December 31, 2021, in aggregate, we owned or leased facilities for current use consisting of approximately 52 million square feet worldwide.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, IBM's facilities in the U.S. had aggregate floor space of approximately 20 million square feet, of which approximately 9 million was owned and 11 million was leased. Outside the U.S., facilities totaled nearly 32 million square feet, of which 7 million was owned and 25 million was leased. This space is primarily used for sales and distribution, manufacturing and development, data processing services including the company's cloud centers, research and other administrative and general support purposes. Our facilities are utilized for current operations of all business segments.\n\nContinuous maintenance and upgrading of facilities are essential to maintain technological leadership, improve productivity and meet customer demand. We believe that in all material respects our properties have been satisfactorily maintained, are in good condition and are suitable for our operations.\n\n## Item 3.

As a result, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an ex tended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flex ibility. Further, the company's results could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the United States. Premium increases could be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue. IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters.\n\nThe Company Is Exposed to Currency and Financing Risks That Could Impact Its Revenue and Business: The company derives a significant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar, as well as sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity. Further, inherent in the company's financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities and the determination of residual values. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments, which involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage its currency and financing risks will be successful.\n\nThe Company's Financial Performance Could Be Impacted by Changes in Market Liquidity Conditions and by Customer Credit Risk on Receivables: The company's financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide, including sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity. The company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its access to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. The company's client base includes many enterprises worldwide, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue coming from global clients across many sectors. Most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis, and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. If the company becomes aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made.\n\n## Risks Related to Ownership of IBM Securities\n\nRisk Factors Related to IBM Securities: The company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. The value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in ex change rates, ex change controls, governmental and stock ex change regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The company's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this Item 1A. entitled 'Risk Factors.'

By 2024, the 0.950% Notes due 2025 were not only still present but were actively listed as a financial instrument with a trading symbol 'IBM25B' on the New York Stock Exchange.

        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 (2022) - The 0.950% Notes due 2025 were referenced as an exhibit in prior filings, indicating disclosure but not active registration.",

(GF), with respect to wafer purchases for our HPC products at the 12 nm and 14 nm technology nodes. Additionally, we utilize TSMC, United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. for the production of our ICs in the form of programmable logic dev ices.\n\n## Other Third-Party Manufacturers\n\nWe outsource board-lev el graphics product manufacturing to third-party manufacturers.\n\n## Assembly, Test, Mark and Packaging Facilities\n\nWafers for our products are either sorted by the foundry or deliv ered by the foundry to our assembly, test, mark and packaging (ATMP) partners or subcontractors located in the Asia-Pacific region who package and test our final semiconductor products. We are party to two ATMP joint v entures (collectiv ely,  the  AT MP  JVs)  with  T ongfu  Microelectronics  Co.,  Ltd.  T he  ATMP  JVs,  Siliconware  Precision  Industries  Ltd.

Intellectual property rights include copyrights, patents, patent applications, trademarks, trade secrets and mask work rights. As of December 28, 2024, we had approximately 7,500 patents in the United States and approximately 1,900 patent applications pending in the United States. In certain cases, we hav e filed  corresponding  applications  in  foreign  jurisdictions.  Including  United  States  and  foreign  matters,  we  hav e  approximately  18,800  patent  matters worldwide consisting of approximately 13,200 issued patents and 5,600 patent applications pending. We expect to file future patent applications in both the United States and abroad on significant inv entions, as we deem appropriate. We do not believ e that any indiv idual patent, or the expiration of any patent, is or would be material to our business. As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we hav e numerous cross-licensing and technology exchange agreements  with  other  companies  under  which  we  both  transfer  and  receiv e  technology  and  intellectual  property  rights.  We  hav e  acquired  v arious licenses from external parties to certain technologies that are implemented in our products, including our IP cores and dev ices. T hese licenses support our continuing ability to make and sell our products. We hav e also acquired licenses to certain proprietary software, open-source software, and related technologies, such as compilers, for our design tools. Continued use of such software and technology is important to the operation of the design tools upon which our customers depend.\n\n## Backlog\n\nSales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current deliv ery or agreements cov ering purchases ov er a period of time. Although such orders or agreements may provide v isibility into future quarters, they may not necessarily be indicativ e of actual sales for any succeeding period as some of these orders or agreements may be rev ised or canceled without penalty.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nOur operating results tend to v ary seasonally. Historically, our net rev enue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends.\n\n## Human Capital\n\nAs  of  December  28,  2024,  we  had  approximately  28,000  employees  in  our  global  workforce.

Areas of focus for us include the following:\n\n## Mission, Culture, and Engagement\n\nOur History - Founded in 1969 as a Silicon Valley start-up, the AMD journey began with dozens of employees focused on leading-edge semiconductor products.

(GF), with respect to wafer purchases for our HPC products at the 12 nm and 14 nm technology nodes. Additionally, we utilize TSMC, United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. for the production of our ICs in the form of programmable logic dev ices.\n\n## Other Third-Party Manufacturers\n\nWe outsource board-lev el graphics product manufacturing to third-party manufacturers.\n\n## Assembly, Test, Mark and Packaging Facilities\n\nWafers for our products are either sorted by the foundry or deliv ered by the foundry to our assembly, test, mark and packaging (ATMP) partners or subcontractors located in the Asia-Pacific region who package and test our final semiconductor products. We are party to two ATMP joint v entures (collectiv ely,  the  AT MP  JVs)  with  T ongfu  Microelectronics  Co.,  Ltd.  T he  ATMP  JVs,  Siliconware  Precision  Industries  Ltd.  (SPIL)  and  King  Yuan Electronics Company (KYEC) provide ATMP services for our products.\n\n## Intellectual Property and Licensing\n\nWe rely on contracts and intellectual property rights to protect our products and technologies from unauthorized third-party copying and use. Intellectual property rights include copyrights, patents, patent applications, trademarks, trade secrets and mask work rights. As of December 28, 2024, we had approximately 7,500 patents in the United States and approximately 1,900 patent applications pending in the United States. In certain cases, we hav e filed  corresponding  applications  in  foreign  jurisdictions.  Including  United  States  and  foreign  matters,  we  hav e  approximately  18,800  patent  matters worldwide consisting of approximately 13,200 issued patents and 5,600 patent applications pending. We expect to file future patent applications in both the United States and abroad on significant inv entions, as we deem appropriate. We do not believ e that any indiv idual patent, or the expiration of any patent, is or would be material to our business. As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we hav e numerous cross-licensing and technology exchange agreements  with  other  companies  under  which  we  both  transfer  and  receiv e  technology  and  intellectual  property  rights.  We  hav e  acquired  v arious licenses from external parties to certain technologies that are implemented in our products, including our IP cores and dev ices. T hese licenses support our continuing ability to make and sell our products. We hav e also acquired licenses to certain proprietary software, open-source software, and related technologies, such as compilers, for our design tools. Continued use of such software and technology is important to the operation of the design tools upon which our customers depend.\n\n## Backlog\n\nSales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current deliv ery or agreements cov ering purchases ov er a period of time. Although such orders or agreements may provide v isibility into future quarters, they may not necessarily be indicativ e of actual sales for any succeeding period as some of these orders or agreements may be rev ised or canceled without penalty.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nOur operating results tend to v ary seasonally. Historically, our net rev enue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends.\n\n## Human Capital\n\nAs  of  December  28,  2024,  we  had  approximately  28,000  employees  in  our  global  workforce.  We  believ e  we  are  at  our  best  when  our  culture  of innov ation, creativ e minds and people from all kinds of backgrounds work together in an engaging and open env ironment. Areas of focus for us include the following:\n\n## Mission, Culture, and Engagement\n\nOur History - Founded in 1969 as a Silicon Valley start-up, the AMD journey began with dozens of employees focused on leading-edge semiconductor products.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n- an enterprise application marketplace and a community of tens of millions of Trailblazers: passionate developers, admins and experts who use Salesforce to innovate and extend the platform with thousands of partner applications.\n\n## Our Business and Growth Strategy\n\nWe continue to expand in the growing addressable markets across all of our service offerings. We continue to focus on several key growth levers, including driving multiple service offering adoption, increasing our penetration with enterprise and international customers and our industry-specific reach with more vertical software solutions. We orient our business strategy and invest for future growth by focusing on the following key priorities:\n\nExpand relationships with existing customers. We see significant opportunities to deepen existing customer relationships through cross-selling and upselling our service offerings. For example, we continue to focus on driving multiple service offering adoption, which provides our customers with a one-stop-shop for their front-office business technology needs. As our customers realize the benefits of our entire suite of service offerings, we aim to upgrade the customers' ex perience with new products and features and gain additional subscriptions by targeting new functional areas and business units. Finally, we aim to ex pand our relationships with ex isting customers through our additional support offerings.\n\nIncrease geographic reach. By extending our go-to-market capabilities globally, we aim to grow our business by selling to new customers in new regions. We will continue to pursue businesses of all sizes in most major markets globally. We also plan to continue to develop distribution channels through new and existing marketplaces and partners for our solutions around the globe and new goto-market strategies. We continue to invest in our domestic and international operations and infrastructure to deliver the highest-quality service to our customers around the world.\n\nFocus on industries and new products. As part of our growth strategy, we are delivering innovative and value-driven solutions in new categories based on our existing and potential customers' needs. For example, we provide out-of-the-box solutions specifically built for customers in certain industries, such as financial services, healthcare and life sciences, manufacturing and more. In addition, through direct discussions and strategic engagements with our customers, we are able to deliver the innovations and enhancements that align with the needs of our customers. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, we introduced Agentforce, the agentic layer of the Salesforce Platform for deploying autonomous AI agents across any business function. Agentforce includes a set of tools to create and customize AI agents, as well as a library of ready-to-use skills for any use case across sales, service, marketing and commerce, Tableau, Slack, partners and more.\n\nLeverage our partner ecosystem. The Salesforce Platform enables customers, independent software vendors ('ISVs') and third-party developers to create, test and deliver cloud-based applications. These applications can be marketed and sold on the AppExchange, our enterprise cloud marketplace, or sold directly by software vendors. In addition, we rely on our consulting partners to deliver technology solutions and expertise to customers, from large-scale implementations to more limited solutions that help businesses run more efficiently. We continue to work with and invest in our partner ecosystem, including these ISVs and system integrators ('SIs'), to accelerate our reach into new markets and industries.\n\nPromote strong customer adoption and reduce customer attrition. We believe that we have the people, processes and proven innovation to help companies transform successfully. Our customer success programs, including success management resources, advisory services, technical architects and business strategists, help enable and accelerate our customers' digital transformations. In addition, we have free, curated resources such as Trailhead to help companies learn our systems and a community of Trailblazers who drive innovation. With these programs and resources, we aim to reduce attrition and secure renewals of existing customer subscriptions.\n\n## Mergers and Acquisitions and Strategic Investments\n\nWe evaluate opportunities to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, technologies and intellectual property to complement our organic innovation and advance the development of our Salesforce Platform. Our evaluation seeks to confirm that any potential acquisition accelerates our strategy, represents an attractive customer opportunity, provides a pathway to effectively monetize the acquired products and drive significant operational efficiencies and presents a clear timeline for value accretion. Our acquisitions can range in size and complexity, from those that enhance or complement existing products and accelerate development of features to large-scale acquisitions that result in new service offerings. Our goal is to prioritize the use of our balance sheet, through cash and debt, to complete acquisitions.\n\nWe also manage a portfolio of strategic investments in both privately held and publicly traded companies focused primarily on enterprise cloud companies, technology startups and SIs. Our investments range from early to late stage companies, including investments made concurrent with a company's initial public offering. We invest in companies that we believe are digitally transforming their industries, improving customer experiences, helping us expand our solution ecosystem or supporting other corporate initiatives, including AI. We plan to continue making these types of strategic investments as opportunities arise that we find attractive, including investments in companies representing targeted businesses, technological initiatives and geographies. Our strategy includes growing our strategic investment portfolio, in part, by reinvesting proceeds from the sales of strategic investments.",

      "question": "How has the nature of the risks associated with Salesforce's AI offerings, including generative AI such as Agentforce, evolved from 2023 to 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Salesforce's primary risk related to third-party integrations and applications centered on potential claims or liabilities stemming from customer expectations for warranties, despite the company not developing or selling these third-party offerings. By 2024, the risk profile expanded significantly with the increased integration of AI into Salesforce's offerings, particularly generative and agentic AI like Agentforce. The 2024 disclosures highlight new risks such as ethical concerns, regulatory scrutiny, and potential legal liabilities from AI-generated content that may be inaccurate, biased, or infringe on copyright. Additionally, the company now anticipates increased costs related to AI governance, compliance, and testing, which were not specifically tied to AI in 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 - In 2023, Salesforce expressed risk around third-party applications and customer expectations for warranties, which could lead to claims or liabilities.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 - In 2024, Salesforce introduced detailed risks around AI, including ethical issues, legal liability from AI-generated content, and increased costs for governance and compliance.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The risk focus shifted from third-party integrations to AI-specific concerns, indicating a transformation in the company's risk strategy tied to its evolving product offerings."

Our decisions about whether to conduct business with potential customers, or whether to continue or expand business with existing customers, may also impact our ability to attract or retain employees and customers, and could result in negative publicity or reputational harm. Further, actions taken by our customers and employees, including through the use or misuse of our products or new technologies for illegal activities or improper information sharing, may result in reputational harm or possible liability, particularly in light of regulatory requirements like the Digital Services Act ('DSA') from the EU. For ex ample, we have been subject to allegations in legal proceedings that we should be liable for the use of certain of our products by third parties. Although we believe that we have a strong defense against these allegations, legal proceedings can be lengthy, expensive and disruptive to our operations and the outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Regardless of outcome, these types of claims could cause reputational harm to our brand or result in liability.\n\nWe are increasingly building AI into many of our offerings, including generative and agentic AI. As with many innovations, AI offerings, such as Agentforce, and our Salesforce Platform present additional risks and challenges that could affect their adoption and therefore our business. For example, the development of our AI offerings and the Salesforce Platform, which provides information regarding our customers' customers, present emerging ethical issues. If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or in other social contex ts, we may ex perience new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability, especially as geopolitical turmoil creates increasingly volatile political and market conditions. Inadequate or ineffective AI development, deployment, content labeling or governance by us or others that result in controversy could also impair the acceptance of AI solutions or result in unintended performance of the services. This in turn could undermine confidence in the decisions, predictions, analysis or other content that our AI applications produce, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability and brand or reputational harm. The rapid evolution of AI will require the application of resources to develop, test and maintain our products and services to help ensure that AI is implemented ethically in order to minimize unintended, harmful impact. Uncertainty around new and emerging AI applications such as generative AI content creation and AI agents will require additional investment in compliance, governance and the licensing or development of proprietary datasets, machine learning models and systems to test for accuracy, bias and other variables, which are often complex, may be costly and could impact our profit margin. Moreover, the move from AI content classification to AI content generation through our development of Agentforce and other generative AI products brings additional risks and responsibility. Known risks of generative AI currently include risks related to accuracy, bias, toxicity, privacy and security and data provenance. For example, AI technologies, including generative AI, may create content that appears correct but is factually inaccurate or flawed, or contains copyrighted or other protected material, and if our customers or others use this flawed or protected content to their detriment, or the owners of such copyrighted material seek to enforce their rights, we may be exposed to brand or reputational harm, competitive harm and/or legal liability. Developing, testing and deploying AI systems may also increase the cost profile of our offerings due to the nature of the computing costs involved in such systems. If we are unable to mitigate these risks, or if we incur ex cessive ex penses in our efforts to do so, our reputation, business, operating results and financial condition may be harmed.\n\n## The evolving landscape related to ESG matters may expose us to risks that could adversely affect our reputation and performance.\n\nEquality and sustainability are core values of the Company. In furtherance of these values, we have in the past and may in the future establish and disclose quantitative and qualitative statements related to ESG matters, which are aspirational and subject to numerous risks and dependencies. The proliferation of regulations addressing climate, human capital and other ESG topics at the regional, state, national and international levels has required and may continue to require significant effort and resources, and our practices, processes and controls may not ensure compliance with evolving standards. Further, various regulations may conflict with each other, making universal compliance challenging as a multinational company, and our status as a government contractor in various jurisdictions, including but not limited to the U.S. where we are headquartered, may also result in greater ex posure or differentiated obligations or requirements with which we would seek to comply. The standards and frameworks for tracking and reporting on ESG matters continue to evolve, and our use, interpretation or application of such frameworks and standards may change from time to time or differ from those of other companies, which may result in a lack of consistent or meaningful comparative data from period to period or between Salesforce and other companies. In addition, our ESG practices and disclosures may not satisfy, appropriately respond to the concerns of or be supported by all investors, customers, partners, regulators, enforcement authorities or other stakeholders (including those in support of and those in",

      "answer": "In 2023, Data Cloud was described as a 'hyperscale, trusted data engine native to Salesforce' that unified enterprise data to deliver a 360-degree view of customers, emphasizing its integration across Salesforce's offerings like Marketing and Analytics. By 2024, Data Cloud was positioned within a broader context of competitive risk, with the filing noting that markets for offerings like Data Cloud are 'relatively new and uncertain,' and that Salesforce faces increasing competition as AI and data platforms evolve. Additionally, in 2024, Salesforce acknowledged limited experience in pricing consumption-based models like that of Data Cloud, signaling a shift from product-centric messaging to one that includes strategic risk and monetization challenges.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nThe market for enterprise applications and platform services is highly competitive, rapidly evolving, fragmented and subject to changing technology, low barriers to entry, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. Many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to a different enterprise software service. Additionally, third-party developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested in other competing technology platforms.\n\nOur current competitors include:\n\n- vendors of packaged business software, as well as companies offering enterprise applications delivered through on-premises offerings from enterprise software application vendors and cloud computing application service providers, either individually or with others;\n- software companies that provide their product or service free of charge as a single product or when bundled with other offerings, or only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality, as well as companies that offer solutions that are sold without a direct sales organization;\n- vendors who offer software tailored to specific services, industries or market segments, as opposed to our full suite of service offerings, including suppliers of traditional business intelligence and data preparation products, integration software vendors, marketing vendors, e-commerce solutions vendors or AI software and service vendors;\n- productivity tool and email providers, unified communications providers and consumer application companies that have entered the business software market; and\n- traditional platform development environment companies and cloud computing development platform companies who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications, including AI-augmented applications, that run on the customers' current infrastructure or as hosted services, as well as would-be customers who may develop enterprise applications for internal use.\n\nIn addition, we may face more competition as we expand our product offerings. Some of our current and potential competitors may have competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more significant installed bases, broader geographic scope, broader suites of service offerings and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical, personnel and other resources. In addition, many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. We also experience competition from smaller, younger competitors that may be more agile in responding to customers' demands and offer more targeted and simplified solutions. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements, or provide competitive pricing, more flexible contracts or faster implementations. Additionally, as we continue to increase building AI into many of our offerings, we face more competition as AI technologies are increasingly integrated into the markets in which we compete. New AI offerings may disrupt workforce needs and negatively impact demand for our offerings, or our competitors may be able to incorporate AI into their offerings more efficiently or successfully than we are able to and achieve greater and faster adoption. Even if our services are more effective than the products and services that our competitors offer, potential customers might select competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our services. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our competitors, which could negatively impact our future sales and harm our business.\n\nOur efforts to expand our service offerings and to develop and integrate our existing services in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and harm our business.\n\nOur efforts to ex pand our current service offerings may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate. In addition, the markets and monetization strategies for certain offerings, including Agentforce and Data Cloud, remain relatively new and uncertain and as a result our expansion into such offerings, and related investments, may present additional risks and challenges. For example, we offer certain products, including Agentforce and Data Cloud, through a consumption-based business model and may increase the number of products through which we do so. We have limited experience with determining optimal pricing for our consumption-based contracts. Additionally, due to customer flexibility in the timing of their consumption, we could have lower levels of customer consumption of our products than we expect which may result in suboptimal pricing for consumption-based contracts. Further, the introduction of future platform changes and upgrades may not result in long term revenue growth.\n\nIf we are unable to develop enhancements to, and new features for, our existing or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business could be harmed. The success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including its timely completion, introduction and market acceptance, as well as our ability to integrate all of our product and service offerings and develop adequate selling capabilities in new markets. Failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth as well as negatively impact our operating results if the additional costs are not offset by additional revenues.

      "answer": "In 2022, Cisco reported gains from available-for-sale debt investments at $9 million, indicating a relatively minor role in their investment portfolio. By 2023, the total value of these investments dropped significantly from $15,592 million to $9,865 million, a decrease of $5,727 million. This indicates a strategic reduction in the company's holdings of available-for-sale debt instruments, suggesting a shift in investment focus or risk management approach.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, Cisco reported a gain of $9 million from available-for-sale debt investments, indicating a modest but positive contribution to investment income.",

        "Step 3: The shift from a small gain to a substantial reduction in investment value suggests a strategic change in Cisco's approach to debt investments, possibly reflecting market conditions or internal financial strategy adjustments."

          "chunk_text": "## PART II Item 8\n\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items  that  are  not  sold  separately,  including  on-premises  licenses  sold  with  SA  or  software  updates  provided  at  no  additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.\n\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\n\nDue  to  the  various  benefits  from  and  the  nature  of  our  SA  program,  judgment  is  required  to  assess  the  pattern  of  delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\n\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period  if  additional  information  becomes  available.  Changes  to  our  estimated  variable  consideration  were  not  material  for  the periods presented.\n\n## Contract Balances and Other Receivables\n\nTiming  of  revenue  recognition  may  differ  from  the  timing  of  invoicing  to  customers.  We  record  a  receivable  when  revenue  is recognized  prior  to  invoicing,  or  unearned  revenue  when  revenue  is  recognized  subsequent  to  invoicing.  For  multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related  to  revenue  recognized  for  multi-year  on-premises  licenses  as  we  have  an  unconditional  right  to  invoice  and  receive payment in the future related to those licenses.\n\nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the  future,  LinkedIn  subscriptions,  Office  365  subscriptions,  Xbox  subscriptions,  Windows  post-delivery  support,  Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.\n\nRefer to Note 13 - Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the period.\n\nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront.\n\nAs of June 30, 2022 and 2021, other receivables due from suppliers were $1.0 billion and $965 million, respectively, and are included in accounts receivable, net in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nAs of June 30, 2022 and 2021, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $3.8 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Office 365 was explicitly listed as a key component of Microsoft's service and other revenue, positioned alongside Azure, Dynamics 365, and Xbox as a core cloud-based solution. By 2024, Office 365 had evolved into a more integrated part of Microsoft\u2019s broader AI-infused cloud services portfolio, reflecting the company's strategic shift to infuse generative AI capabilities into commercial offerings. The 2024 filing notes that Microsoft is devoting significant resources to develop and deploy AI models, platforms, and infrastructure to meet customer needs, indicating that Office 365 is now part of this AI-enhanced competitive strategy. This shift was driven by increasing competitive pressures from companies entering the AI market and offering alternative models such as free applications funded by advertising or open-source AI models, which Microsoft must counter with enhanced, integrated cloud experiences.",

The  recast  of  these  prior  period amounts  had  no  impact  on  our  consolidated  balance  sheets,  consolidated  income  statements,  or  consolidated  cash  flows statements.\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of  Microsoft  Corporation  and  its  subsidiaries.  Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\n## Estimates and Assumptions\n\nPreparing  financial  statements  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the  nature  and  timing  of  satisfaction  of  performance  obligations,  and  determining  the  standalone  selling  price  ('SSP')  of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for,  our  inventory;  stock-based  compensation  forfeiture  rates;  when  technological  feasibility  is  achieved  for  our  products;  the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management's estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.\n\nIn  July  2022,  we  completed  an  assessment  of  the  useful  lives  of  our  server  and  network  equipment.  Due  to  investments  in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. This change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2023. We had previously increased the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment in July 2020.\n\n## Foreign Currencies\n\nAssets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses  are  translated  at  average  rates  of  exchange  prevailing  during  the  year.  Translation  adjustments  resulting  from  this process are recorded to other comprehensive income.\n\n## Revenue\n\n## Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue\n\nProduct  revenue  includes  sales  from  operating  systems,  cross-device  productivity  applications,  server  applications,  business solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, video games, and hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories.\n\nService and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and Xbox; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn.",

Our competitors continue to develop and deploy cloud-based serv ices for consumers and business customers, and pricing and deliv ery models are ev olv ing. We and our competitors are dev oting significant resources to dev elop and deploy our cloud-based strategies.\n- We are inv esting in artificial intelligence ('AI') across the entire company and infusing generativ e AI capabilities into our consumer and commercial offerings. We expect AI technology and serv ices to be a highly competitiv e and rapidly ev olv ing market, and new competitors continue to enter the market. We will bear significant dev elopment and operational costs to build and support the AI models, serv ices, platforms, and infrastructure necessary to meet the needs of our customers. To compete effectiv ely we must also be responsiv e to technological change, new and potential regulatory dev elopments, and public scrutiny.\n- Even as we transition more of our business to infrastructure-, platform-, and software-as-a-serv ice business model, the license-based proprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software rev enue. We bear the costs of conv erting original ideas into software products through inv estments in research and dev elopment, offsetting these costs with the rev enue receiv ed from licensing our products. Many of our competitors also dev elop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model.\n- Other competitors dev elop and offer free applications, online serv ices, and content, and make money by selling third-party adv ertising. Advertising rev enue funds dev elopment of products and serv ices these competitors prov ide to users at little or no cost, competing directly with our rev enue-generating products.\n- Some companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost to end users, using open source AI models, and earning rev enue on adv ertising or integrated products and serv ices. These firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the open source products. Some open source products mimic the features and functionality of our products.\n\nThe competitiv e pressures described abov e may cause decreased sales v olumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for research and dev elopment, marketing, and sales incentiv es, which may adv ersely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nOur focus on cloud-based and AI services presents execution and competitive risks. We are incurring significant costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing and AI serv ices. These costs will reduce the operating margins. Whether we succeed in cloud-based and AI serv ices depends on our execution in sev eral areas, including:\n\n- Continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based and AI experiences and products that generate increasing traffic and market share.\n- Maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based and AI serv ices on the growing array of computing dev ices, including PCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other dev ices.\n- Continuing to enhance the attractiv eness of our cloud platforms to third-party dev elopers.\n- Ensuring our cloud-based serv ices meet the reliability expectations and specific requirements of our customers and maintain the security of their data as well as help them meet their own compliance needs.\n- Making our suite of cloud-based serv ices platform-agnostic, av ailable on a wide range of dev ices and ecosystems, including those of our competitors.\n\nIt is uncertain whether our strategies will continue to attract users or generate the rev enue required to succeed. If we are not effectiv e in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innov ation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and serv ices, we may not grow rev enue in line with the infrastructure and dev elopment inv estments described abov e.

For enterprises, digital technology empowers employees, optimizes operations, engages customers, and in some cases, changes the v ery core of products and serv ices. We continue to inv est in high performance and sustainable computing to meet the growing demand for fast access to Microsoft serv ices prov ided by our network of cloud computing and AI infrastructure and datacenters.\n\nOur cloud business benefits from three economies of scale: datacenters that deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; datacenters that coordinate and aggregate div erse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns, improv ing the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy locations that lower application maintenance labor costs.\n\nThe Microsoft Cloud prov ides the best integration across the technology stack while offering openness, improv ing time to v alue, reducing costs, and increasing agility. As the foundation of the Microsoft Cloud, Azure uniquely offers hybrid consistency, dev eloper productiv ity, data and AI capabilities, and trusted security and compliance.\n\nWe offer supercomputing power for AI at scale to run large workloads, complemented by our rapidly expanding portfolio of AI cloud serv ices and hardware, which includes custom-built silicon and strong partnerships with chip manufacturers.

We have broadened our approach to how we think about gaming end-to-end,  from  the  way  games  are  created  and  distributed  to  how  they  are  played,  including  cloud  gaming  so  players  can stream across PC, console, and mobile. We have a strong position with our large and growing highly engaged community of gamers, including the acquisition of ZeniMax Media Inc., the parent company of Bethesda Softworks LLC. In January 2022, we announced  plans  to  acquire Activision  Blizzard,  Inc.,  a  leader  in  game  development  and  an  interactive  entertainment  content publisher. Xbox Game Pass is a community with access to a curated library of over 100 first- and third-party console and PC titles. Xbox Cloud Gaming is Microsoft's game streaming technology that is complementary to our console hardware and gives fans the ultimate choice to play the games they want, with the people they want, on the devices they want.\n\n## Our Future Opportunity\n\nThe case for digital transformation has never been more urgent. Customers are looking to us to help improve productivity and the affordability of their products and services. We continue to develop complete, intelligent solutions for our customers that empower people to stay productive and collaborate, while safeguarding businesses and simplifying IT management. Our goal is to lead the industry in several distinct areas of technology over the long term, which we expect will translate to sustained growth. We are investing significant resources in:\n\n- Transforming the workplace to deliver new modern, modular business applications, drive deeper insights, and improve how people communicate, collaborate, learn, work, play, and interact with one another.\n- Building and running cloud-based services in ways that unleash new experiences and opportunities for businesses and individuals.\n- Applying AI to drive insights and act on our customer's behalf by understanding and interpreting their needs using natural methods of communication.\n- Tackling security from all angles with our integrated, end-to-end solutions spanning security, compliance, identity, and management, across all clouds and platforms.\n- Inventing new gaming experiences that bring people together around their shared love for games on any devices and pushing the boundaries of innovation with console and PC gaming by creating the next wave of entertainment.\n- Using Windows to fuel our cloud business, grow our share of the PC market, and drive increased engagement with our services like Microsoft 365 Consumer, Teams, Edge, Bing, Xbox Game Pass, and more.\n\nOur future growth depends on our ability to transcend current product category definitions, business models, and sales motions. We have the opportunity to redefine what customers and partners can expect and are working to deliver new solutions that reflect the best of Microsoft.\n\n## Corporate Social Responsibility\n\n## Commitment to Sustainability\n\nWe work to ensure that technology is inclusive, trusted, and increases sustainability. We are accelerating progress toward a more sustainable future by reducing our environmental footprint, advancing research, helping our customers build sustainable solutions, and advocating for policies that benefit the environment. In January 2020, we announced a bold commitment and detailed plan to be carbon negative by 2030, and to remove from the environment by 2050 all the carbon we have emitted since our founding in 1975. This included a commitment to invest $1 billion over four years in new technologies and innovative climate solutions. We built  on  this  pledge  by  adding  commitments  to  be  water  positive  by  2030,  zero  waste  by  2030,  and  to  protect  ecosystems  by developing a Planetary Computer. We also help our suppliers and customers around the world use Microsoft technology to reduce their own carbon footprint.\n\nFiscal year 2021 was a year of both successes and challenges. While we continued to make progress on several of our goals, with an overall reduction in our combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, our Scope 3 emissions increased, due in substantial part to significant  global  datacenter  expansions and growth in Xbox sales and usage as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite these Scope 3 increases, we will continue to build the foundations and do the work to deliver on our commitments, and help our customers and partners achieve theirs. We have learned the impact of our work will not all be felt immediately, and our experience highlights how progress won't always be linear.",

Our game content is dev eloped through a collection of first-party studios creating iconic and differentiated gaming experiences. We continue to inv est in new gaming studios and content to expand our intellectual property roadmap and lev erage new content creators. These unique gaming experiences are the cornerstone of X box Game Pass, a subscription serv ice and gaming community with access to a curated library of ov er 400 first- and third-party console and PC titles.\n\nThe gamer remains at the heart of the X box ecosystem. We are identifying new opportunities to attract gamers across a v ariety of different end points through our first- and third-party content and business div ersification across subscriptions, ads, and digital stores. We'v e seen new dev ices from thirdparty manufacturers along with key PC and mobile end points that help us empower gamers to play in a way that is most conv enient to them. We are focused on growing the platform and expanding to new ecosystems to engage as many gamers as possible.\n\nXbox enables people to connect and share online gaming experiences that are accessible on X box consoles, Windows-enabled dev ices, and other devices. X box is designed to benefit users by prov iding access to a network of certified applications and serv ices and to benefit our dev eloper and partner ecosystems by providing access to a large customer base. X box rev enue is mainly affected by subscriptions and sales of first- and third-party content, as well as adv ertising. Growth of our Gaming business is determined by the ov erall activ e user base through X box enabled content, av ailability of games, prov iding exclusiv e game content that gamers seek, the computational power and reliability of the dev ices used to access our content and serv ices, and the ability to create new experiences.\n\n## Search and News Advertising\n\nOur Search and news advertising business is designed to deliv er relev ant search, nativ e, and display adv ertising to a global audience. Our Microsoft Edge browser and Bing search engine with Copilot are key tools to enable user acquisition and engagement, while our technology platform enables accelerated deliv ery of digital adv ertising solutions. In addition to first-party tools, we hav e sev eral partnerships with companies, such as Yahoo, through which we prov ide and monetize search offerings. Growth depends on our ability to attract new users, understand intent, and match intent with relev ant content on adv ertising offerings.\n\n## Competition\n\nWindows faces competition from v arious software products and from alternativ e platforms and dev ices, mainly from Apple and Google, and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint competes with CrowdStrike on endpoint security solutions. We believ e Windows competes effectiv ely by giv ing customers choice, value, flexibility, security, an easy-to-use interface, and compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications, including those that enable productiv ity.\n\nDevices face competition from v arious computer, tablet, and hardware manufacturers who offer a unique combination of high-quality industrial design and innov ativ e technologies across v arious price points. These manufacturers, many of which are also current or potential partners and customers, include Apple and our Windows OEMs.\n\nXbox and our cloud gaming serv ices face competition from v arious online gaming ecosystems and game streaming serv ices, including those operated by Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Tencent. We also compete with other prov iders of entertainment serv ices such as v ideo streaming platforms. Our gaming platform competes with console platforms from Nintendo and Sony, both of which hav e a large, established base of customers. We believ e our gaming platform is effectiv ely positioned against, and uniquely differentiated from, competitiv e products and serv ices based on significant innov ation in hardware architecture, user interface, dev eloper tools, online gaming and entertainment serv ices, and continued strong content from our own first-party game franchises as well as other digital content offerings.\n\nOur Search and news advertising business competes with Google, OpenAI, and a wide array of websites, social platforms like Meta, and portals that prov ide content and online offerings to end users.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART I\n\nItem 1\n\nWhile fiscal year 2021 presented us with some new learnings, we also made some great progress. A few examples that illuminate the diversity of our work include:\n\n- We purchased the removal of 1.4 million metrics tons of carbon.\n- Four of our datacenters received new or renewed Zero Waste certifications.\n- We granted  $100  million  to  Breakthrough  Energy  Catalyst  to  accelerate  the  development  of  climate  solutions  the world needs to reach net-zero across four key areas: direct air capture, green hydrogen, long duration energy storage, and sustainable aviation fuel.\n- We joined the First Movers Coalition as an early leader and expert partner in the carbon dioxide removal sector, with a commitment of $200 million toward carbon removal by 2030.\n\nSustainability  is  an  existential  priority  for  our  society  and  businesses  today.  This  led  us  to  create  our  Microsoft  Cloud  for Sustainability,  an  entirely  new  business  process  category  to  help  organizations  monitor  their  carbon  footprint  across  their operations. We also joined with leading organizations to launch the Carbon Call - an initiative to mobilize collective action to solve carbon emissions and removal accounting challenges for a net zero future.\n\nThe investments we make in sustainability carry through to our products, services, and devices. We design our devices, from Surface to Xbox, to minimize their impact on the environment. Our cloud and AI services and datacenters help businesses cut energy consumption, reduce physical footprints, and design sustainable products.\n\n## Addressing Racial Injustice and Inequity\n\nWe are committed to addressing racial injustice and inequity in the United States for Black and African American communities and helping improve lived experiences at Microsoft, in employees' communities, and beyond. Our Racial Equity Initiative focuses on three multi-year pillars, each containing actions and progress we expect to make or exceed by 2025.\n\n- Strengthening  our  communities:  using  data,  technology,  and  partnerships  to  help  improve  the  lives  of  Black  and African American people in the United States, including our employees and their communities.\n- Evolving  our  ecosystem:  using  our  balance  sheet  and  relationships  with  suppliers  and  partners  to  foster  societal change and create new opportunities.\n- Increasing representation and strengthening inclusion: build on our momentum, adding a $150 million investment to strengthen inclusion and double the number of Black, African American, Hispanic, and Latinx leaders in the United States by 2025.\n\nOver  the  last  year,  we  collaborated  with  partners  and  worked  within  neighborhoods  and  communities  to  launch  and  scale  a number of projects and programs, including: working with 70 organizations in 145 communities on the Justice Reform Initiative, expanding  access  to  affordable  broadband  and  devices  for  Black  and African American  communities  and  key  institutions  that support them in major urban centers, expanding access to skills and education to support Black and African American students and adults to succeed in the digital economy, and increasing technology support for nonprofits that provide critical services to Black and African American communities.\n\nWe have made meaningful progress on representation and inclusion at Microsoft. We are 90 percent of the way to our 2025 commitment to double the number of Black and African American people managers, senior individual contributors, and senior leaders in the U.S., and 50 percent of the way for Hispanic and Latinx people managers, senior individual contributors, and senior leaders in the U.S.\n\nWe exceeded our goal on increasing the percentage of transaction volumes with Black- and African American-owned financial institutions  and  increased  our  deposits  with  Black-  and  African  American-owned  minority  depository  institutions,  enabling increased funds into local communities. Additionally, we enriched our supplier pipeline, reaching more than 90 percent of our goal to spend $500 million with double the number of Black and African American-owned suppliers. We also increased the number of identified  partners  in  the  Black  Partner  Growth  Initiative  and  continue  to  invest  in  the  partner  community  through  the  Black Channel Partner Alliance by supporting events focused on business growth, accelerators, and mentorship.\n\nProgress does not undo the egregious injustices of the past or diminish those who continue to live with inequity. We are committed to leveraging our resources to help accelerate diversity and inclusion across our ecosystem and to hold ourselves accountable to accelerate change - for Microsoft, and beyond.",

We're encouraged by ongoing progress across our campuses and datacenters, and throughout our value chain.\n\n## Addressing Racial Injustice and Inequity\n\nIn June 2020, we outlined a series of multi-year commitments designed to address the racial injustice and inequity experienced by racial and ethnic minorities in the United States, including Black and African American communities. We remain committed to addressing racial injustice and inequity and helping improv e liv ed experiences at Microsoft, in employees' communities, and beyond.\n\nIn fiscal year 2024, we continued to collaborate with partners and worked within neighborhoods and communities to adv ance projects and programs. We grew our Nonprofit Tech Acceleration for Black and African American Communities program, to help more than 3,000 local organizations in nearly 1,900 Black and African American communities use technical solutions to modernize and streamline operations. We also expanded our Technology Education and Learning Support ('TEALS') program to reach nearly 550 high schools across 21 racial equity expansion regions with the support of nearly 1,500 volunteers, 12% of whom identify as Black or African American.\n\nWe have committed $150 million in Minority Depository Institutions and funds supporting Black and African American-owned small businesses. These commitments drive sustained impact by directly enabling an increase of funds into local communities, improv ing div erse, small-business access to capital, and increasing skill dev elopment. We continue to partner with div erse-owned banking partners and asset managers to catalyze growth and industry participation. Additionally, we enriched our supplier pipeline, achiev ing our goal to spend $500 million with double the number of Black- and African American-owned suppliers. We hav e also prov ided 162 low- or no-interest loans to our small to medium-sized partners through our Partner Capital Fund.\n\nWe also continue to make progress toward our ov erall commitment to double the number of Black and African American and Hispanic and Latinx leaders in the U.S. by 2025.\n\n## Investing in Digital Skills\n\nMicrosoft's Skills for Jobs initiativ e aims to support a more skills-based labor market, with greater flexibility and accessible learning paths to dev elop the right skills needed for the most in-demand jobs. This initiativ e brings together classes, Career Essentials Certificates, and other resources from LinkedIn, GitHub, and Microsoft Learn, and is built on data insights drawn from LinkedIn's Economic Graph. Our goal was to train and certify 10 million learners by 2025. As of May 2024, we hav e surpassed that goal, training and certifying 12.6 million learners. We also launched a campaign in the United States in 2021 to help skill and recruit 250,000 people into the nation's cybersecurity workforce by 2025, representing half of the country's workforce shortage. To that end, we are making curriculum av ailable free of charge to all of the nation's higher education institutions, prov iding training for new and existing faculty, and prov iding scholarships and supplemental resources to 25,000 students. The cyber skills initiativ e has expanded to 27 additional countries that show elev ated cyberthreat risks coupled with significant gaps in their cybersecurity workforces, where we'v e partnered with nonprofits and other educational institutions to train the next generation of cybersecurity workers.\n\nGenerativ e AI is creating unparalleled opportunities to empower workers globally, but only if ev eryone has the skills to use it. In June 2023, we launched an AI Skills initiativ e to help ev eryone learn how to harness the power of AI. This includes a new LinkedIn learning pathway offering new coursework on learning the foundations of generativ e AI. We also launched a new global grant challenge to uncov er new ways of training workers on generativ e AI and prov ide greater access to digital learning ev ents and resources. Additionally, we extended our reach in rural communities, including through our TechSpark initiativ e in the United States. As of June 2024, we'v e helped more than 2.5 million people in 92% of the world's countries learn how to use AI.\n\n## HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nMicrosoft aims to recruit, dev elop, and retain world-changing talent from a div ersity of backgrounds. To foster their and our success, we seek to create an environment where people can thriv e and do their best work. We striv e to maximize the potential of our human capital resources by creating a respectful, rewarding, and inclusiv e work env ironment that enables our global employees to create products and serv ices that further our mission. Microsoft's culture is grounded in growth mindset. This means ev eryone is on a continuous journey to learn and grow, operating as one company instead of multiple siloed businesses. Our culture also embeds the security of customers and Microsoft as a priority for ev ery employee and across all of our organizations.",

We deliver our products and services to customers worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models. These models include on-premise, cloud-based and hybrid deployments (an approach that combines both on-premise and cloud based deployments). Oracle Cloud Software-as-a-Service and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (SaaS and OCI, respectively, and collectively, Oracle Cloud Services) offerings provide comprehensive and integrated applications and infrastructure services enabling our customers to choose the best option that meets their specific business needs. Customers may also elect to purchase Oracle software licenses and hardware products and related services to manage their own cloud-based or on-premise IT environments. Customers that purchase our software licenses may elect to purchase license support contracts, which provide our customers with rights to unspecified license upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period as well as technical support assistance. Customers that purchase our hardware products may elect to purchase hardware support contracts, which provide customers with software updates and can include product repairs, maintenance services, and technical support services. We also offer customers a broad set of services offerings that are designed to improve customer utilization of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies.\n\nOracle Corporation conducts business globally and was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977.\n\n## Basis of Financial Statements\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interest positions of certain of our consolidated entities are reported as a separate component of consolidated equity from the equity attributable to Oracle's stockholders for all periods presented. The noncontrolling interests in our net income were not significant to our consolidated results for the periods presented and therefore have not been presented separately and instead are included as a component of non-operating expenses, net in our consolidated statements of operations. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The comparability of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended May 31, 2022 was impacted by $4.7 billion of certain litigation related charges during fiscal 2022.\n\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we finalized our adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting and subsequent amendments to the initial guidance, which had no material impact to our consolidated financial statements or notes thereto for the year ended May 31, 2024.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), and we consider various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the SEC. These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected.

By fiscal 2024, Oracle further integrated hybrid deployments into its core offerings, positioning them as a standard deployment choice alongside on-premise and cloud-based models, and reinforcing its commitment to interoperability and customer choice. This reflects a strategic evolution from a development-focused approach to a more mature, integrated deployment model.",

Our products and services include  enterprise  applications  and  infrastructure  offerings  that  are  delivered  worldwide  through  a  variety  of  flexible  and interoperable  IT  deployment  models.  These  models  include  on-premise  deployments,  cloud-based  deployments,  and  hybrid deployments  (an  approach  that  combines  both  on-premise  and  cloud-based  deployment)  such  as  our  Oracle  Cloud@Customer offering  (an  instance  of  Oracle  Cloud  in  a  customer's  own  data  center).  Accordingly,  we  offer  choice  and  flexibility  to  our customers  and  facilitate  the  product,  service  and  deployment  combinations  that  best  suit  our  customers'  needs.  Our  customers include businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers that we market and sell to directly through our worldwide sales force and indirectly through the Oracle Partner Network. Using Oracle technologies, our customers build,  deploy,  run,  manage  and  support  their  internal  and  external  products,  services  and  business  operations  including,  for example, a global cloud applications developer that utilizes Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to power its software-as-a-service (SaaS)  offerings;  a  multi-national  financial  institution  that  runs  its  banking  applications  using  the  Oracle  Exadata  Database Machine;  and  a  global  consumer  products  company  that  leverages  Oracle  Fusion  Cloud  Enterprise  Resource  Planning  for  its accounting processes, consolidation and financial planning functions.\n\nOracle Cloud Services offerings, which include Oracle SaaS and OCI offerings, provide comprehensive and integrated applications and  infrastructure  services  delivered  via  cloud-based  deployment  models.  Oracle  Cloud  Services  integrate  the  IT  components, including software, hardware and services, on a customer's behalf in a cloud-based IT environment that Oracle deploys, manages, supports and upgrades for the customer and that a customer may access utilizing common web browsers via a broad spectrum of devices.\n\nOracle Cloud Services are designed to be rapidly deployable to enable customers shorter time to innovation; intuitive for casual and experienced users; easily maintainable to reduce upgrade, integration and testing work; connectable among differing deployment models to enable interchangeability and extendibility between IT environments; compatible to easily move workloads between the Oracle Cloud and other IT environments; cost-effective by requiring lower upfront customer investment; and secure, standardsbased and reliable.\n\nOracle  cloud  license  and  on-premise  license  deployment  offerings  include  Oracle  Applications,  Oracle  Database  and  Oracle Middleware software offerings, among others, which customers deploy using IT infrastructure from the Oracle Cloud or their own cloud-based or on-premise IT environments. Substantially all customers, at their option, purchase license support contracts when they purchase an Oracle license.\n\nOracle  hardware  products  include  Oracle  Engineered  Systems,  servers,  storage  and  industry-specific  products,  among  others. Customers generally opt to purchase hardware support contracts when they purchase Oracle hardware products.\n\nOracle also offers services to assist our customers and partners to maximize the performance of their Oracle purchases.\n\nProviding  choice  and  flexibility  to  Oracle  customers  as  to  when  and  how  they  deploy  Oracle  applications  and  infrastructure technologies is an important element of our corporate strategy. We believe that offering customers broad, comprehensive, flexible and interoperable deployment models for Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies is important to our growth strategy and  better  addresses  customer  needs  relative  to  our  competitors,  many  of  whom  provide  fewer  offerings,  more  restrictive deployment models and less flexibility for a customer's transition to cloud-based IT environments.\n\nOur investments in, and innovation with respect to, Oracle products and services that we offer through our three businesses (cloud and license, hardware and services businesses, described further below) are another important element of our corporate strategy. In fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, we invested $7.2 billion, $6.5 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively, in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of offerings and to develop new technologies and services. We have a deep understanding as to how applications and infrastructure technologies interact and function with one another including through the use of OCI to power our Oracle Fusion SaaS Applications, which we and our customers use to run internal business processes. We focus our development efforts on improving the performance, security, operation, integration and cost-effectiveness of our offerings",

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Oracle invested $7.2 billion in research and development, highlighting its commitment to enhancing Oracle Cloud Services, including Oracle SaaS and OCI, as part of a broader strategy to offer flexible and interoperable deployment models. Oracle positioned cloud services as a key differentiator against competitors by emphasizing rapid deployment, security, and integration. By fiscal year 2024, Oracle continued to emphasize cloud services but restructured its messaging to position Oracle Cloud Software-as-a-Service and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure as central to enabling customers to 'choose the best option that meets their specific business needs.' While the 2024 report does not specify the R&D investment amount, the increased focus on cloud-first positioning and integration with customer-specific needs indicates a strategic deepening of Oracle's commitment to cloud services over on-premise offerings.",

Our products and services include  enterprise  applications  and  infrastructure  offerings  that  are  delivered  worldwide  through  a  variety  of  flexible  and interoperable  IT  deployment  models.  These  models  include  on-premise  deployments,  cloud-based  deployments,  and  hybrid deployments  (an  approach  that  combines  both  on-premise  and  cloud-based  deployment)  such  as  our  Oracle  Cloud@Customer offering  (an  instance  of  Oracle  Cloud  in  a  customer's  own  data  center).  Accordingly,  we  offer  choice  and  flexibility  to  our customers  and  facilitate  the  product,  service  and  deployment  combinations  that  best  suit  our  customers'  needs.  Our  customers include businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers that we market and sell to directly through our worldwide sales force and indirectly through the Oracle Partner Network. Using Oracle technologies, our customers build,  deploy,  run,  manage  and  support  their  internal  and  external  products,  services  and  business  operations  including,  for example, a global cloud applications developer that utilizes Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to power its software-as-a-service (SaaS)  offerings;  a  multi-national  financial  institution  that  runs  its  banking  applications  using  the  Oracle  Exadata  Database Machine;  and  a  global  consumer  products  company  that  leverages  Oracle  Fusion  Cloud  Enterprise  Resource  Planning  for  its accounting processes, consolidation and financial planning functions.\n\nOracle Cloud Services offerings, which include Oracle SaaS and OCI offerings, provide comprehensive and integrated applications and  infrastructure  services  delivered  via  cloud-based  deployment  models.  Oracle  Cloud  Services  integrate  the  IT  components, including software, hardware and services, on a customer's behalf in a cloud-based IT environment that Oracle deploys, manages, supports and upgrades for the customer and that a customer may access utilizing common web browsers via a broad spectrum of devices.\n\nOracle Cloud Services are designed to be rapidly deployable to enable customers shorter time to innovation; intuitive for casual and experienced users; easily maintainable to reduce upgrade, integration and testing work; connectable among differing deployment models to enable interchangeability and extendibility between IT environments; compatible to easily move workloads between the Oracle Cloud and other IT environments; cost-effective by requiring lower upfront customer investment; and secure, standardsbased and reliable.\n\nOracle  cloud  license  and  on-premise  license  deployment  offerings  include  Oracle  Applications,  Oracle  Database  and  Oracle Middleware software offerings, among others, which customers deploy using IT infrastructure from the Oracle Cloud or their own cloud-based or on-premise IT environments. Substantially all customers, at their option, purchase license support contracts when they purchase an Oracle license.\n\nOracle  hardware  products  include  Oracle  Engineered  Systems,  servers,  storage  and  industry-specific  products,  among  others. Customers generally opt to purchase hardware support contracts when they purchase Oracle hardware products.\n\nOracle also offers services to assist our customers and partners to maximize the performance of their Oracle purchases.\n\nProviding  choice  and  flexibility  to  Oracle  customers  as  to  when  and  how  they  deploy  Oracle  applications  and  infrastructure technologies is an important element of our corporate strategy. We believe that offering customers broad, comprehensive, flexible and interoperable deployment models for Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies is important to our growth strategy and  better  addresses  customer  needs  relative  to  our  competitors,  many  of  whom  provide  fewer  offerings,  more  restrictive deployment models and less flexibility for a customer's transition to cloud-based IT environments.\n\nOur investments in, and innovation with respect to, Oracle products and services that we offer through our three businesses (cloud and license, hardware and services businesses, described further below) are another important element of our corporate strategy. In fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, we invested $7.2 billion, $6.5 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively, in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of offerings and to develop new technologies and services. We have a deep understanding as to how applications and infrastructure technologies interact and function with one another including through the use of OCI to power our Oracle Fusion SaaS Applications, which we and our customers use to run internal business processes. We focus our development efforts on improving the performance, security, operation, integration and cost-effectiveness of our offerings",

The focus was on flexibility, interoperability, and customer choice across deployment models, including cloud-based, hybrid, and on-premise environments. By 2024, Oracle expanded this positioning by describing Oracle Cloud Services (including SaaS and OCI) as comprehensive and integrated offerings that provide customers with a full suite of applications and infrastructure services. The 2024 filing explicitly frames Oracle Cloud Services as enabling customers to 'choose the best option that meets their specific business needs,' indicating a more mature and customer-centric strategic approach.

We  driv e  innov ation  through  high-performance  and  adaptiv e  computing technology, software and product leadership.\n\nWith our high-performance product portfolios, we deliv er differentiated solutions, such as our semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoCs), Adaptiv e SoCs, and accelerated processing units (APUs), and platform lev el client computing dev ices, embedded platforms and serv ers for our customers. We offer a deep portfolio of data center computing solutions including AI accelerators, microprocessors (CPUs), graphic processing units (GPUs), data processing units (DPUs),  Smart  Network  Interface  Cards  (SmartNICs),  and  field  programmable  gate  arrays  (FPGAs),  to  meet  the  v ast  computing  performance requirements  of  today's  data  centers,  supercomputers, AI  and  Machine  Learning  (ML)  data  center  env ironments  and  cloud  env ironments.  We  driv e innov ation  with  our  line-up  of  CPUs, APUs  and  chipsets  for  desktops  and  notebooks,  to  bring  performance,  efficiency, AI  capabilities  and  modern security features to gamers, creators, consumers and enterprises. AMD was the first company to integrate a dedicated neural processing unit (NPU) on the same SoC as an x86 CPU for AI PCs. Our GPUs, including discrete GPUs, semi-custom SoC products and development services, work together with software to power immersiv e gaming experiences for PCs, game consoles and cloud gaming serv ices. We are a leader in embedded computing, where we deliv er high-performance and scalability across a full portfolio of CPUs, APUs, FPGAs, system on modules (SOMs) and Adaptiv e SoCs that are  used  in  a  v ariety  of  markets,  including  automotiv e,  industrial,  healthcare,  storage  and  networking.  We  also  incorporate  dedicated AI  processing capabilities into our embedded portfolio.\n\nWe  develop  world-class  software  stacks  that  are  used  to  enable  our  high-performance  products.  Our  software  stacks  include  dev elopment  tools, compilers, and driv ers for our CPUs, APUs, GPUs and FPGAs. We work closely with our customers to define and dev elop customized solutions to precisely match their requirements. We enable this by combining our broad portfolio of high-performance IP with our leadership design and packaging to deliv er world-class customized solutions to our customers. We inv est in innov ativ e technology and solutions such as our custom-ready chiplet platform and AMD Infinity Architecture to maintain our leadership position as a custom-design silicon prov ider of choice.\n\n## Our Strategy\n\nWe believe that AI is defining the next era of computing and that the full potential of AI will be realized when the technology is perv asiv e across cloud, edge and end devices. We believ e AMD has the compute engines, intellectual property, software capabilities and expertise to be a leader in this next computing era with a broad, portfolio of high-performance compute engines spanning across supercomputing, cloud, edge, embedded and end dev ices. We believe we hav e a unique opportunity to make AMD the end-to-end AI leader based on the breadth of our technology and product portfolios.\n\nOur AI strategy is focused on three priorities. T he first is deliv ering a broad portfolio of high-performance adaptiv e hardware and software solutions. T he second is expanding the deep and collaborativ e partnerships we hav e established across the ecosystem to accelerate deployments of AMD based AI solutions at scale. And the third is prov iding compelling user experiences to extend the open and prov en software platform we hav e established that enables our AI hardware to be deployed more broadly and easily.\n\nOne of our priorities in 2024 was to accelerate growth in our Data Center segment. The demand for our data center AI accelerator products was v ery strong as large hyperscaler customers, OEMs and ODMs deployed our AMD Instinct\u2122 MI300X  GPUs. During the year, we announced that we have accelerated our AMD AI accelerator roadmap to deliv er an annual cadence of leadership AMD  Instinct solutions.  We announced our 5th  Gen AMD EPYC\u2122 family of server processors, prov iding leadership performance and capabilities for a wide range of data center workloads.\n\nDuring the year, we completed the acquisition of Silo AI Oy (Silo AI), an AI lab based in Finland. The acquisition of Silo AI expanded our capability to accelerate dev elopment and deployment of AI models on AMD hardware. Silo AI has also dev eloped a software stack used to train multiple state-of-theart large language models (LLMs) on AMD Instinct accelerators that can accelerate the dev elopment of highly-performant AMD training solutions.",

      "question": "How has AMD's relationship with semi-custom SoC products evolved from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of revenue structure and strategic positioning?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AMD's relationship with semi-custom SoC products was characterized by dependency, with revenue derived from both non-recurring engineering fees and sales of the products themselves, and success was directly tied to third-party product performance. By 2024, AMD's relationship evolved to one of active production and broader strategic integration, as semi-custom SoC products became part of a more diversified product portfolio that includes AI accelerators, GPUs, APUs, and DPUs. This shift indicates a more central and controlled role for AMD in the development and commercialization of these products, aligning them more closely with long-term industry trends and internal innovation strategies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2022, AMD's semi-custom SoC revenue was explicitly tied to third-party product success, including both non-recurring engineering fees and sales-based revenue, indicating a dependency model.",
        "By 2024, AMD's consolidated financial statements and product descriptions reflect that semi-custom SoC products are now part of a broader, integrated product lineup, suggesting a shift toward internal production and strategic control.",
        "The evolution from a dependency model to a production model indicates a strategic shift in AMD's positioning, where semi-custom SoC products are no longer peripheral but are core components of AMD\u2019s broader semiconductor offerings."

          "chunk_text": "The  success  of  our  business  is  dependent  upon  our  ability  to  introduce  products  on  a  timely  basis  with features  and  performance  levels  that  provide  value  to  our  customers  while  supporting  and  coinciding  with significant industry transitions.\n\nOur success depends to a significant extent on the development, qualification, implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers. Our ability to develop, qualify and distribute, and  have  manufactured,  new  products  and  related  technologies  to  meet  evolving  industry  requirements,  at  prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis, are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target  markets.  As  consumers  have  new  product  feature  preferences  or  have  different  requirements  than  those consumers in the PC market, PC sales could be negatively impacted, which could adversely impact our business. Our product  roadmap  includes  our  next-generation  AMD  Ryzen\u2122,  AMD  Radeon\u2122  and AMD  EPYC\u2122  processors.  We cannot assure you that our efforts to execute our product roadmap will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers. If we fail to or are delayed in developing, qualifying or shipping new products or technologies that provide value to our customers and address these new trends or if we fail to predict which new form factors consumers will adopt and adjust our business accordingly, we may lose competitive positioning, which could cause  us  to  lose  market  share  and  require  us  to  discount  the  selling  prices  of  our  products.  Although  we  make substantial investments in research and development, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully  implement  new  products  and  technologies  on  a  timely  basis  or  that  they  will  be  well-received  by  our customers. Moreover, our investments in new products and technologies involve certain risks and uncertainties and could disrupt our ongoing business. New investments may not generate sufficient revenue, may incur unanticipated liabilities  and  may  divert  our  limited  resources and distract management from our current operations. We cannot be certain that our ongoing investments in new products and technologies will be successful, will meet our expectations and will not adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results.\n\nDelays in developing, qualifying or shipping new products can also cause us to miss our customers' product design windows or, in some cases, breach contractual obligations or cause us to pay penalties. If our customers do not include our products in the initial design of their computer systems or products, they will typically not use our products in their systems  or  products  until  at  least  the  next  design  configuration.  The  process  of  being  qualified  for  inclusion  in  a customer's system or product can be lengthy and could cause us to further miss a cycle in the demand of end-users, which also could result in a loss of market share and harm our business. We also depend on the success and timing of our customers' platform launches. If our customers delay their product launches or if our customers do not effectively market their platforms with our products, it could result in a delay in bringing our products to market and cause us to miss a cycle in  the  demand  of  end-users,  which  could  materially  adversely  affect  our  business.  In  addition,  market demand requires that products incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry-wide basis. Over the  life  of  a  specific  product,  the  sale  price  is  typically  reduced  over  time.  The  introduction  of  new  products  and enhancements  to  existing  products  is  necessary  to  maintain  the  overall  corporate  average  selling  price.  If  we  are unable  to  introduce  new  products  with  sufficiently  high  sale  prices  or  to  increase  unit  sales  volumes  capable  of offsetting the reductions in the sale prices of existing products over time, our business could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Our revenue from our semi-custom SoC products is dependent upon our semi-custom SoC products being incorporated into customers' products and the success of those products.\n\nThe  revenue  that  we  receive  from  our  semi-custom  SoC  products  is  in  the  form  of  non-recurring  engineering  fees charged to third parties  for  design  and  development  services  and  revenue  received  in  connection  with  sales  of  our semi-custom SoC products to these third parties. As a result, our ability to generate revenue from our semi-custom products depends on our ability to secure customers for our semi-custom design pipeline, our customers' desire to pursue the project and our semi-custom SoC products being incorporated into those customers' products. Any revenue from sales of our semi-custom SoC products is directly related to sales of the third-party's products and reflective of their  success in the market. Moreover, we have no control over the marketing efforts of these third parties, and we cannot make any assurances that sales of their products will be successful in current or future years. Consequently, the semi-custom  SoC  product  revenue  expected  by  us  may  not  be  fully  realized  and  our  operating  results  may  be adversely affected.",

References herein to AMD or the Company mean Adv anced Micro Dev ices, Inc. and its  consolidated  subsidiaries. AMD's  products  include Artificial  Intelligence  (AI) Accelerators,  x86  microprocessors  (CPUs)  and  graphics  processing units  (GPUs),  as  standalone  dev ices  or  as  incorporated  into  accelerated  processing  units  (APUs),  chipsets,  data  center  and  professional  GPUs, embedded processors, semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products, microprocessor and SoC development services and technology, data processing units (DPUs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), System on Modules (SOMs), Smart Network Interface Cards (SmartNICs), and Adaptiv e SoC products. From time to time, the Company may also sell or license portions of its intellectual property (IP) portfolio.\n\n## NOTE 2 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\n\nFiscal Year .  T he  Company uses a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 ended on December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Fiscal years 2024 and 2023 each consisted of 52 weeks, while fiscal year 2022 consisted of 53 weeks.\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company's accounts and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Upon consolidation, all inter-company accounts and transactions hav e been eliminated.\n\nReclassification  and  Change  in  Presentation. Unbilled  receiv ables  of  $1.1  billion  as  of  December  30,  2023  were  reclassified  from  within  Accounts receiv able, net to within Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and in the Statements of Cash Flows to conform to current period presentation.\n\nUse of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of rev enues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results are likely  to  differ  from  those  estimates,  and  such  differences  may  be  material  to  the  financial  statements. Areas  where  management  uses  subjectiv e judgment include, but are not limited to, rev enue allowances, inv entory v aluation, v aluation of goodwill and long-liv ed and intangible assets, and income taxes.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or serv ices and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or serv ices. Sales, v alue-added, and other taxes collected concurrently with the prov ision  of  goods  or  serv ices  are  excluded  from  rev enue.  Shipping  and  handling  costs  associated  with  product  sales  are  included  in  cost  of  sales. Substantially all of the Company's rev enue is deriv ed from product sales.\n\nCustomers are generally required to pay for products and serv ices within the Company's standard contractual terms, which are typically net 30  to 60 days. The Company has determined that it does not hav e significant financing components in its contracts with customers.\n\n## Non-custom products\n\nThe  Company  transfers  control  and  recognizes  rev enue  when  non-custom  products  are  shipped  to  customers,  which  includes  original  equipment manufacturers (OEM) and distributors, in accordance with the shipping terms of the sale. Certain OEMs may be entitled to rights of return and rebates under  OEM  agreements.  The  Company  also  sells  to  distributors  under  terms  allowing  the  majority  of  distributors  certain  rights  of  return  and  price protection on unsold merchandise held by them. The Company estimates the amount of v ariable consideration under OEM and distributor arrangements and, accordingly, records a prov ision for product returns, allowances for price protection and rebates based on actual historical experience and any known events.",

We serve these markets with our CPU, GPU, APU, and customized SoC products.\n\nServer . A  server  is  a  computer  system  that  performs  services  for  connected  customers  as  part  of  a  client-server architecture. Many servers are designed to run an application or applications often for extended periods of time with minimal  human  intervention.  Examples  of  servers  include  cloud,  web,  e-mail,  print  and  on-premise  servers.  These servers  can  run  a  variety  of  applications,  including  business  intelligence,  enterprise  resource  planning,  customer relationship management and advanced scientific or engineering models to solve advanced computational problems in disciplines ranging from financial modeling to weather forecasting to oil and gas exploration. Servers are also used in cloud computing, which is a computing model where data, applications and services are delivered over the internet or an  intranet  which  can  be  rapidly  provisioned  and  released  with  minimal  effort.  Today's  data  centers  require  new technologies and configuration models to meet the demand driven by the growing amount of data that needs to be stored,  accessed,  analyzed  and  managed.  Servers  must  be  efficient,  scalable  and  adaptable  to  meet  the  compute characteristics of new and changing workloads. We leverage our technology to address the computational and visual data processing needs in the data center market where we design CPUs, GPUs, and software for HPC, cloud gaming, and cloud and enterprise customers.\n\nEmbedded . Embedded  products  address  computing  needs  in  enterprise-class  telecommunications,  networking, security, storage systems and thin clients, which are computers that serve as an access device on a network. Typically, AMD embedded products are used in applications that  require  high  to  moderate  levels  of  performance,  where  key features  may  include  relatively  low  power,  small  form  factors,  and  24x7  operations.  High-performance  graphics  are important  in  some  embedded  systems.  Support  for  Linux\u00ae,  Windows\u00ae  and  other  operating  systems  as  well  as  for increasingly sophisticated applications are also critical for some customers. Other requirements may include meeting rigid specifications for industrial temperatures, shock, vibration and reliability. The embedded market has moved from developing proprietary, custom designs to leveraging industry-standard instruction set architectures and processors as a way to help reduce costs and speed time to market.\n\nSemi-Custom . We leverage our core IP, including our graphics and processing technologies to develop semi-custom solutions. In this market, semiconductor suppliers work alongside system designers and manufacturers to enhance the performance and overall user experience for semi-custom customers. We have used this collaborative co-development approach with many of today's leading game console and handheld PC gaming manufacturers and can also address customer needs in many other markets. We leverage our existing IP to create a variety of products tailored to a specific customer's  needs,  ranging  from  complex  fully-customized  SoCs  to  more  modest  adaptations  and  integrations  of existing CPU, APU or GPU products.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AMD's semi-custom SoC products were described as being dependent on third-party product success, with revenue tied to both non-recurring engineering fees and the incorporation of AMD's SoCs into customer devices. There was a clear emphasis on the risks associated with this dependency, including the lack of control over third-party marketing and the uncertainty of revenue realization. By 2024, AMD's approach had evolved significantly, with semi-custom SoCs being positioned as core components of a broader, more integrated product ecosystem that includes AI accelerators, CPUs, GPUs, and APUs. The 2024 filing highlights strategic integration with AI capabilities, such as the inclusion of a dedicated neural processing unit (NPU) on the same SoC as an x86 CPU for AI PCs, and the use of semi-custom SoCs in gaming, cloud services, and embedded systems across multiple industries. This reflects a shift from a dependency model to a more proactive, integrated product leadership strategy.",

Our ability to develop, qualify and distribute, and  have  manufactured,  new  products  and  related  technologies  to  meet  evolving  industry  requirements,  at  prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis, are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target  markets.  As  consumers  have  new  product  feature  preferences  or  have  different  requirements  than  those consumers in the PC market, PC sales could be negatively impacted, which could adversely impact our business. Our product  roadmap  includes  our  next-generation  AMD  Ryzen\u2122,  AMD  Radeon\u2122  and AMD  EPYC\u2122  processors.  We cannot assure you that our efforts to execute our product roadmap will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers. If we fail to or are delayed in developing, qualifying or shipping new products or technologies that provide value to our customers and address these new trends or if we fail to predict which new form factors consumers will adopt and adjust our business accordingly, we may lose competitive positioning, which could cause  us  to  lose  market  share  and  require  us  to  discount  the  selling  prices  of  our  products.  Although  we  make substantial investments in research and development, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully  implement  new  products  and  technologies  on  a  timely  basis  or  that  they  will  be  well-received  by  our customers. Moreover, our investments in new products and technologies involve certain risks and uncertainties and could disrupt our ongoing business. New investments may not generate sufficient revenue, may incur unanticipated liabilities  and  may  divert  our  limited  resources and distract management from our current operations. We cannot be certain that our ongoing investments in new products and technologies will be successful, will meet our expectations and will not adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results.\n\nDelays in developing, qualifying or shipping new products can also cause us to miss our customers' product design windows or, in some cases, breach contractual obligations or cause us to pay penalties. If our customers do not include our products in the initial design of their computer systems or products, they will typically not use our products in their systems  or  products  until  at  least  the  next  design  configuration.  The  process  of  being  qualified  for  inclusion  in  a customer's system or product can be lengthy and could cause us to further miss a cycle in the demand of end-users, which also could result in a loss of market share and harm our business. We also depend on the success and timing of our customers' platform launches. If our customers delay their product launches or if our customers do not effectively market their platforms with our products, it could result in a delay in bringing our products to market and cause us to miss a cycle in  the  demand  of  end-users,  which  could  materially  adversely  affect  our  business.  In  addition,  market demand requires that products incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry-wide basis. Over the  life  of  a  specific  product,  the  sale  price  is  typically  reduced  over  time.  The  introduction  of  new  products  and enhancements  to  existing  products  is  necessary  to  maintain  the  overall  corporate  average  selling  price.  If  we  are unable  to  introduce  new  products  with  sufficiently  high  sale  prices  or  to  increase  unit  sales  volumes  capable  of offsetting the reductions in the sale prices of existing products over time, our business could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Our revenue from our semi-custom SoC products is dependent upon our semi-custom SoC products being incorporated into customers' products and the success of those products.\n\nThe  revenue  that  we  receive  from  our  semi-custom  SoC  products  is  in  the  form  of  non-recurring  engineering  fees charged to third parties  for  design  and  development  services  and  revenue  received  in  connection  with  sales  of  our semi-custom SoC products to these third parties. As a result, our ability to generate revenue from our semi-custom products depends on our ability to secure customers for our semi-custom design pipeline, our customers' desire to pursue the project and our semi-custom SoC products being incorporated into those customers' products. Any revenue from sales of our semi-custom SoC products is directly related to sales of the third-party's products and reflective of their  success in the market. Moreover, we have no control over the marketing efforts of these third parties, and we cannot make any assurances that sales of their products will be successful in current or future years. Consequently, the semi-custom  SoC  product  revenue  expected  by  us  may  not  be  fully  realized  and  our  operating  results  may  be adversely affected.",

BUSINESS\n\n## Overview\n\nWe are a global technology leader that designs, develops and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. Our over 50-year history of innovation dates back to our diverse origins from HewlettPackard Company, AT&amp;T, LSI Corporation, Broadcom Corporation, Brocade Communications Systems LLC, CA, Inc. and Symantec Enterprise Security. Over the years, we have assembled a large team of semiconductor and software design engineers around the world. We maintain design, product and software development engineering resources at locations in the U.S., Asia, Europe and Israel, providing us with engineering expertise worldwide. We strategically focus our research and development resources to address niche opportunities in our target markets and leverage our extensive portfolio of U.S. and other patents, and other intellectual property ('IP') to integrate multiple technologies and create system-on-chip ('SoC') component and software solutions that target growth opportunities. We design products and software that deliver high-performance and provide mission critical functionality.\n\nWe develop semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor ('CMOS') based devices and analog III-V based products. We have a history of innovation in the semiconductor industry and offer thousands of products that are used in end products such as enterprise and data center networking, home connectivity, set-top boxes ('STB'), broadband access, telecommunication equipment, smartphones and base stations, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays. We differentiate ourselves through our high performance design and integration capabilities and focus on developing products for target markets where we believe we can earn attractive margins.\n\nOur infrastructure software solutions enable customers to plan, develop, automate, manage, and secure applications across mainframe, distributed, mobile, and cloud platforms. Many of the largest companies in the world, including most of the Fortune 500, and many government agencies rely on our software solutions to help manage and secure their on-premise and hybrid cloud environments. Our portfolio of industry-leading infrastructure and security software is designed to modernize, optimize, and secure the most complex hybrid environments, enabling scalability, agility, automation, insights, resiliency and security. We also offer mission critical fibre channel storage area networking ('FC SAN') products and related software in the form of modules, switches and subsystems incorporating multiple semiconductor products.\n\n## Business Strategy\n\nOur strategy is to combine best-of-breed technology leadership in semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions, with unmatched scale, on a common sales and administrative platform to deliver a comprehensive suite of infrastructure technology products to the world's leading business and government customers. We seek to achieve this through responsibly financed acquisitions of category-leading businesses and technologies, as well as investing extensively in research and development, to ensure our products retain their technology leadership. This strategy results in a robust business model designed to drive diversified and sustainable operating and financial results.\n\n## Products and Markets\n\n## Semiconductor Solutions\n\nSemiconductors are made by imprinting a network of electronic components onto a semiconductor wafer. These devices are designed to perform various functions such as processing, amplifying and selectively filtering electronic signals, controlling electronic system functions and processing, and transmitting and storing data. Our digital and mixed signal products are based on silicon wafers with CMOS transistors offering fast switching speeds and low power consumption, which are both critical design factors for the markets we serve. We also offer analog products, which are based on III-V semiconductor materials that have higher electrical conductivity than silicon, and thus tend to have better performance characteristics in radio frequency ('RF'), and optoelectronic applications. III-V refers to elements from the 3rd and 5th groups in the periodic table of chemical elements. Examples of these materials used in our products are gallium arsenide ('GaAs') and indium phosphide ('InP').\n\nWe provide semiconductor solutions for managing the movement of data in data center, service provider, enterprise and embedded networking applications. We provide a broad variety of RF semiconductor devices, wireless connectivity solutions, custom touch controllers and inductive charging solutions for the wireless market. We also provide semiconductor solutions for enabling the STB and broadband access applications and for enabling secure movement of digital data to and from host machines, such as servers, personal computers and storage systems, to the underlying storage devices, such as hard disk drives ('HDD') and solid-state drives ('SSD').\n\nOur product portfolio ranges from discrete devices to complex sub-systems that include multiple device types and may also incorporate firmware for interfacing between analog and digital systems. In some cases, our products include mechanical hardware that interfaces with optoelectronic or capacitive sensors. We focus on markets that require high quality and the",

      "question": "How has Oracle's strategic positioning of Oracle Database evolved between 2023 and 2024 in terms of deployment flexibility and integration with engineered systems, and what does this indicate about the company's approach to cloud migration and hybrid IT environments?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Oracle emphasized the flexibility of running Oracle Database across multiple deployment models, including on-premise, Oracle Cloud, and multicloud environments, with specific offerings like Oracle Exadata Cloud@Customer and Oracle Roving Edge Infrastructure. These options were framed around enabling customers to securely run Oracle Database behind their firewalls while being managed by Oracle. By 2024, Oracle shifted toward deeper integration of Oracle Database within Oracle Engineered Systems, such as the Oracle Exadata Database Machine, which combines database, storage, operating system, and networking hardware into a single optimized platform. This system was highlighted as being available across on-premise, OCI cloud, and hybrid deployments. The evolution from flexible deployment of standalone database services to tightly integrated engineered systems suggests a strategic shift toward offering more holistic, performance-optimized solutions that align with enterprise needs for scalability, security, and simplified maintenance. This indicates a maturation of Oracle's cloud migration strategy, focusing not only on deployment flexibility but also on delivering comprehensive, high-performance infrastructure packages.",

We deliver our products and services to customers worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models. These models include on-premise, cloud-based and hybrid deployments (an approach that combines both on-premise and cloud based deployments). Oracle Cloud Software-as-a-Service and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (SaaS and OCI, respectively, and collectively, Oracle Cloud Services) offerings provide comprehensive and integrated applications and infrastructure services enabling our customers to choose the best option that meets their specific business needs. Customers may also elect to purchase Oracle software licenses and hardware products and related services to manage their own cloud-based or on-premise IT environments. Customers that purchase our software licenses may elect to purchase license support contracts, which provide our customers with rights to unspecified license upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period as well as technical support assistance. Customers that purchase our hardware products may elect to purchase hardware support contracts, which provide customers with software updates and can include product repairs, maintenance services, and technical support services. We also offer customers a broad set of services offerings that are designed to improve customer utilization of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies.\n\nOracle Corporation conducts business globally and was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977.\n\n## Basis of Financial Statements\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interest positions of certain of our consolidated entities are reported as a separate component of consolidated equity from the equity attributable to Oracle's stockholders for all periods presented. The noncontrolling interests in our net income were not significant to our consolidated results for the periods presented and therefore have not been presented separately and instead are included as a component of non-operating expenses, net in our consolidated statements of operations. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The comparability of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended May 31, 2022 was impacted by $4.7 billion of certain litigation related charges during fiscal 2022.\n\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we finalized our adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting and subsequent amendments to the initial guidance, which had no material impact to our consolidated financial statements or notes thereto for the year ended May 31, 2024.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), and we consider various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the SEC. These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected.

      "question": "How has Qualcomm's strategic focus on 5G technologies evolved from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of investment emphasis and commercialization outcomes?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Qualcomm was heavily investing in 5G technologies as part of its broader strategy to expand beyond mobile handsets into areas like automotive and IoT, with an emphasis on developing leading and cost-effective 5G-based technologies and products. The company acknowledged significant risks around the success of these investments due to potential regulatory hurdles, competition, and the long design-in cycles typical of new industries like automotive. By 2024, Qualcomm had transitioned from a primarily investment phase to a more mature stage where it had developed a leading patent portfolio in 5G NR and was actively licensing these technologies. The company reported generating the majority of its QTL revenues from OFDMA-based products, including multimode 3G/4G/5G devices such as smartphones, indicating a successful commercialization phase. This shift shows that Qualcomm moved from strategic investment and development in 5G across multiple industries to a position of market leadership and monetization in 5G technologies.",

Similarly, if, due to U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, we were limited in or prohibited from obtaining critical integrated circuit products from our suppliers in China, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially harmed. See also the Risk Factor titled ' We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices.

Our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications, and related technologies and products, as well as in our existing technologies and products, and new technologies, may not generate operating income or contribute to future results of operations that meet our expectations.\n\nWhile we continue to invest significant resources toward advancements primarily in support 5G-based technologies, we also invest in new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, by utilizing our existing technical and business expertise and through acquisitions or other strategic transactions.\n\nIn particular, our future growth depends in part on new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, such as automotive and IoT; our ability to develop leading and cost-effective technologies and products for these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications; and third parties incorporating our technologies and products into devices used in these product areas, industries and applications. Accordingly, we intend to continue to make substantial investments in these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications, and in developing new products and technologies for these product areas, industries and applications. Our growth also depends significantly on our ability to develop and patent 5G technologies, and to develop and commercialize products using 5G technologies.\n\nHowever, our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications, and corresponding technologies and products, as well as in our existing technologies and products and new technologies in mobile handsets, may not succeed because, among other reasons: we may not be issued patents on the technologies we develop; the technologies we develop may not be incorporated into relevant standards; new and expanded product areas, industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, and consumer demand therein, may not develop or grow as anticipated; we may be unable to attract or retain employees with the necessary skills in such new and expanded product areas, industries and applications; our strategies or the strategies of our customers, licensees or partners may not be successful; alternate technologies or products may be better or may reduce the advantages we anticipate from our investments; competitors' technologies or products may be more cost effective, have more capabilities or fewer limitations or be brought to market faster than our new technologies or products; we may not be able to develop, or our competitors may have more established and/or stronger, customer, vendor, distributor or other channel relationships; and competitors may have longer operating histories in industries and applications that are new to us. We may also underestimate the costs of, or overestimate the future revenues or margins that could result from these investments, and these investments may not, or may take many years to, generate material returns.\n\nFurther, the automotive industry is subject to long design-in time frames, long product life cycles and a high degree of regulatory and safety requirements, necessitating suppliers to the industry to comply with stringent qualification processes, very low defect rates and high reliability standards, all of which results in significant barriers to entry and increased costs.\n\nIf our products fail to perform to specifications, compete with the product quality of our competitors or meet quality and/or regulatory standards of a particular industry or application (including product safety and information security standards, which may differ by region, geography and industry, and which are particularly stringent in the automotive industry), we may be unable to successfully expand our business in that industry or application, and our growth could be limited.\n\nIn addition, in order to successfully extend our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, we may need to transition to new business models and transform aspects of our organization, and we may not be successful in doing so.",

      "question": "How has the ownership structure and equity relationship between Accenture plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. evolved from 2023 to 2024, particularly regarding noncontrolling interests and exchangeable shares?",
      "answer": "In 2023, the noncontrolling ownership interests in Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. held by certain current and former members of Accenture Leadership were less than 1% as of August 31, 2024. By 2024, the structure had evolved to include detailed provisions around Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, which can be exchanged for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis or redeemed for cash. Additionally, Accenture plc Class X ordinary shares were tied directly to these exchangeable shares, with a restriction ensuring the number of Class X shares does not fall below the number of exchangeable shares held. This indicates a more formalized and structured equity relationship in 2024 compared to the simpler noncontrolling interest disclosure in 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. was primarily referenced in terms of noncontrolling interests held by Accenture Leadership, which were less than 1%.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the equity structure was expanded to include detailed descriptions of exchangeable shares, Class A ordinary shares, and Class X ordinary shares, with specific rules governing their redemption, exchange, and voting rights.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a transformation in the equity relationship, moving from a basic noncontrolling interest disclosure to a more complex and structured ownership framework involving multiple share classes and redemption/exchange mechanisms."

      "answer": "In 2023, the filing noted that clients were reducing or deferring spending on smaller contracts with shorter durations and that there was a slowdown in client spending, especially for consulting services. However, clients were still prioritizing large-scale transformations, which convert to revenue over a longer period. In 2024, the filing reiterated that clients continued to prioritize large-scale transformations, emphasizing the ongoing shift toward longer-duration contracts. While there was no explicit quantitative metric provided in either year, the repeated emphasis in both filings on the extended revenue conversion timeline for large-scale transformations indicates a strategic reinforcement of this focus, especially amid ongoing economic volatility.",

          "chunk_text": "## Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations (including revenues and profitability) and/or stock price. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that may broadly affect companies, including us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or stock price. Risks in this section are grouped in the following categories: (1) Business Risks; (2) Financial Risks; (3) Operational Risks; and (4) Legal and Regulatory Risks. Many risks affect more than one category, and the risks are not in order of significance or probability of occurrence because they have been grouped by categories.\n\n## Business Risks\n\nOur results of operations have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic and geopolitical conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients' businesses and levels of business activity.\n\nGlobal macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions affect us, our clients' businesses and the markets they serve. V olatile, negative and uncertain economic and geopolitical conditions have in the past undermined and could in the future undermine business confidence in our significant markets and other markets, which are increasingly interdependent, causing our clients to reduce or defer their spending on new initiatives and technologies, and resulting in clients reducing, delaying or eliminating spending under existing contracts with us, which negatively affects our business. Growth in some of the markets we serve has slowed and could continue to slow, or could slow in other markets or stagnate or contract, in each case, for an extended period of time. Because we operate globally and have significant businesses in many markets, an economic slowdown in any of those markets could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nOngoing economic and geopolitical volatility and uncertainty and changing demand patterns affect our business in a number of other ways, including making it more difficult to accurately  forecast client demand and effectively build our revenue and resource plans, particularly in consulting. Economic and geopolitical volatility and uncertainty is particularly  challenging because it may take some time for the effects and changes in demand patterns resulting from these and other factors to manifest themselves in our business and results of operations. Changing demand patterns from economic and political volatility and uncertainty, including as a result of increasing geopolitical tensions, inflation, economic downturns, changes in global trade policies, global health emergencies and their impact on us, our clients and the industries we serve, have in the past had a negative impact and could in the future have a significant negative impact on our results of operations. For example, some of these conditions slowed the pace and level of client spending, particularly for smaller contracts with a shorter duration and for our consulting services during fiscal 2024. Clients continue to prioritize large-scale transformations, which convert to revenue over a longer period.\n\nOur business depends on generating and maintaining client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations.\n\nOur financial results depend in part on the demand for our services and solutions, which could be negatively affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product. A s described above, volatile, negative or uncertain global economic and political conditions and lower growth or contraction in the markets we serve have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect client demand for our services and solutions. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and offerings to serve the evolving needs of our clients. Examples of areas of significant change include digital-, cloud- and security-related offerings, which are continually evolving, as well as developments in areas such as A I, including generative A I, augmented and virtual reality, automation, blockchain, Internet of Things, quantum and edge computing, infrastructure and network engineering, intelligent connected products, digital",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2023, Accenture acquired Class A Ordinary Shares primarily through share withholding for payroll tax obligations related to employee equity awards. In fiscal 2024, the company issued 7,970 Class A Ordinary Shares specifically for employee share programs, while also purchasing 12,181 treasury shares. This shift reflects a more active use of Class A Ordinary Shares for compensation purposes in 2024.

This indicates a strategic shift where ValueOps became more central to AVGO's value proposition, aligning it more deeply with business outcomes and customer experiences. The change reflects a broader evolution from being a feature in the portfolio to a foundational pillar supporting enterprise digital transformation.",

      "answer": "The estimated cost to complete for the VMware Cloud Foundation July 2024 releases remained unchanged at $38 million from fiscal year 2023 to fiscal year 2024. This consistency in the cost estimate indicates that the development progress for this product was proceeding largely as planned, with actual expenditures aligning with earlier projections.

      "answer": "In 2023, Broadcom highlighted the risk of dedicating significant additional resources such as product engineering and incurring additional costs and expenses due to the implementation of production for major design wins, particularly for custom AI accelerators. By 2024, the company continued to emphasize the same risks but specifically noted that these challenges 'are exacerbated' by the dependency of AI-related products on the continued success in product development and engineering. This indicates that while the core risk remained, the company placed greater emphasis on the link between AI product success and operational strain, signaling an evolution in how Broadcom framed the financial and operational risks associated with AI accelerator design win implementation.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, Broadcom disclosed that implementing production for major design wins (e.g., custom AI accelerators) could strain resources and require significant additional engineering and cost outlays.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the company maintained the same risk disclosure but added that these risks are 'exacerbated' by the dependency of AI-related products on continued success in development and product engineering.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a deeper articulation of the same risk, with 2024 introducing a stronger linkage between AI product complexity and operational strain, indicating a shift in how Broadcom communicates the financial exposure tied to AI accelerator design wins."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOur semiconductor customers are not generally required to purchase specific quantities of products. Even when customers agree to source an agreed portion of their product needs from us, such arrangements often include pricing schedules or methodologies that apply regardless of the volume of products purchased, and those customers may not purchase the amount of product we expect. As a result, we may not generate the amount of revenue or achieve the level of profitability we expect under such arrangements. Moreover, our top customers' purchasing power has, in some cases, given them the ability to make greater demands on us with regard to pricing and contractual terms in general. Some customers may even reduce the amount of products or decline to purchase due to their internal development of the products. The loss of, or any substantial reduction in sales to, any of our top customers, including our hyperscale customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## We operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by rapid price erosion, wide fluctuations in product supply and demand, constant and rapid technological change, evolving technical standards, evolving markets such as AI, frequent new product introductions, and short product life cycles. From ti me to time, these factors, together with changes in general economic conditions, cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry and in our business. The market for AI-related products has resulted in a significant upturn in certain segments of the industry resulting in record revenue, which may not be sustainable. Previously the industry experienced a significant upturn due to a supply imbalance that resulted in record profitability and increases in average selling prices, which was followed by a down-cycle resulting in diminished demand for end-user products, high inventory levels and periods of inventory adjustment, and elimination of expedite fees. Historically, such down-cycles have also been characterized by under-utilization of manufacturing capacity, changes in revenue mix and accelerated erosion of average selling prices, which can lead to reduced profitability and a decline in our stock price. The Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America Act could also result in an increase in supply leading to excess inventory and a decrease in average selling prices. We expect our business to continue to be subject to cyclical downturns even when overall economic conditions are relatively stable. If we cannot offset industry or market downturns, our net revenue may decline and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\n\n## We make investments in research and development and the slow or unsuccessful return of our investments could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, new technological trends such as AI and cloud computing, changes in customer requirements, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, short product cycles, evolving industry standards and new delivery methods. In addition, to compete successfully in the semiconductor industry, we must continue to develop and respond to technological advancements and requirements, such as low-power consumption, higher bandwidth and increase in the number of clusters. Failure to successfully develop increasingly advanced technologies, i ncluding ASICs such as custom AI accelerators or XPUs and other AI-related products, could impair our competitive position. In order to remain competitive, we have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments in research and development. If we fail to timely develop new and enhanced products and technologies, if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted, or if new competitive technologies that we do not support become widely accepted, demand for our products such as our custom AI accelerators or XPUs and other AI-related products may be reduced. Increased investments in research and development, or slow or unsuccessful research and development efforts, would have a negative impact on our financial results.\n\n## Winning business in the semiconductor solutions industry is subject to a lengthy process that often requires us to incur significant expense, from which we may ultimately generate no revenue.\n\nOur semiconductor business is dependent on us winning competitive bid selection processes, known as 'design wins.' These selection processes are typically lengthy and can require us to dedicate significant development expenditures and scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity. Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product. This can result in lost revenue and can weaken our position in future selection processes.\n\nWinning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer. Customers could delay or cancel plans, fail to qualify our products, reduce or discontinue use of our products or fail to successfully market and sell their products, which could reduce demand for our products and cause us to hold excess i nventory, materially adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the timing of design wins is unpredictable and i mplementing production for a major design win or multiple design wins at the same time, such as our design wins for our custom AI accelerators or XPUs and other AI-related products, may strain our resources and those of our CMs. In such event, we may be forced to dedicate significant additional resources such as product engineering and incur additional costs and expenses, which we expect to continue for our AI-related products. These risks are exacerbated by the fact that many of our products, such as our AI-related products, are dependent on our continued success in the development and quality of our products and product engineering.",

By 2024, ValueOps was no longer listed as a standalone domain; instead, it was integrated into the broader Distributed Software Portfolio alongside DevOps and AIOps, suggesting a strategic shift toward a more unified operational framework.

      "answer": "In the 2023 10-K filing, Apple stated that while it believes ownership of intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business, it 'relies primarily' on the innovative skills, technical competence, and marketing abilities of its personnel. In the 2024 filing, Apple shifted its language, stating that it 'depends heavily' on these same three factors\u2014innovative skills, technical competence, and marketing abilities\u2014tying them directly to ensuring a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services, and technologies to the marketplace. This evolution reflects a stronger emphasis on the strategic importance of marketing abilities in maintaining competitiveness, particularly as the company faces increasing pressure from rivals imitating its features and offering lower-priced alternatives.",

          "chunk_text": "The Company's ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software  applications  and  related  services.  Principal  competitive  factors  important  to  the  Company  include  price,  product  and  service  features (including security features), relative  price  and  performance, product and service quality and reliability , design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\n\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company's competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company's services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.  The  Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the  Company's product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.\n\n## Supply of Components\n\nAlthough most components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company , including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\n\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers' yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements.\n\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\n\n## Research and Development\n\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company's ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development ('R&amp;D'), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. A lthough the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\n\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company's products and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.\n\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property , many of the Company's products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company's products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.",

      "answer": "In the 2023 10-K filing, Apple announced the iPhone 16 Pro as part of its Fourth Quarter 2024 product lineup, indicating it was still in the planning and launch phase. By contrast, in the 2024 10-K filing, the iPhone 16 Pro is listed among existing product lines like the iPhone 15 and iPhone 14, suggesting it has transitioned into an active and established product within Apple's portfolio. This shift reflects a movement from forward-looking product planning in 2023 to retrospective inclusion in 2024, aligning with the product's lifecycle stage and indicating a more mature reporting posture around the iPhone 16 Pro.",

      "question": "How did Qualcomm's strategic shift from enabling wireless access point technologies in 2022 to directly producing them in 2023 affect its competitive positioning and product portfolio breadth in the broader networking market?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Qualcomm's involvement with wireless access points was limited to enabling the technology through its foundational wireless innovations and chipset solutions, as noted in its discussion of edge networking growth driven by 5G and Wi-Fi 6 adoption. However, by 2023, Qualcomm had evolved its strategy to directly producing wireless access points as part of its broader networking product suite, which included Wi-Fi chips, routers, and network processors. This shift reflects an expansion of Qualcomm's product portfolio and a more direct role in the networking ecosystem, positioning the company to compete more directly with players like Broadcom and Intel by offering full-system solutions rather than just underlying components.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Qualcomm's relationship with wireless access points was indirect, focusing on enabling technologies like 5G and Wi-Fi 6 that support access point development by others.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, Qualcomm explicitly listed wireless access points as part of its product offerings, indicating a strategic move to produce these devices directly.",
        "Step 3: The shift from enabling to producing represents a significant evolution in Qualcomm's market positioning, expanding its reach into higher-level networking systems and enhancing competitive differentiation."

          "chunk_text": "Consumer demand for new experiences, combined with the needs of mobile operators and device manufacturers to provide differentiated features and services, is driving continued innovation within the smartphone across connectivity, processing, AI, multimedia, imaging, audio and more. As a result, the smartphone continues to be the go-to device for social networking, music and video streaming, photography and video capture, e-commerce, gaming, email, web browsing and more. 5G enables these experiences to be more immersive, intuitive and interactive.\n\nTransforming Other Industries: Automotive. According to analyst data, more than 70% of new vehicles produced in 2028 are projected to have embedded cellular connectivity, with 60% of cellular connected vehicles featuring 5G connectivity. By comparison, 60% of vehicles produced in 2021 had embedded cellular connectivity, with 5G connectivity expected to ramp in 2023 (Strategy Analytics, October 2022).\n\nDigitalization of the automotive cockpit continues to transform the in-vehicle experience, enabling greater personalization of content and settings for both drivers and passengers as automakers respond to growing interest from consumers to bring their digital lifestyles into the vehicle. Car-to-cloud platforms are helping automakers improve cost efficiencies, create new service opportunities throughout the lifecycle of a vehicle with over-the-air (OTA) update capabilities and valuable vehicle and usage analytics. This is driving the development of a new architecture for the software-defined vehicle. High-performance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are being used to improve vehicles with advanced driver assistance and automated driving features that we expect to scale across vehicle tiers and continue the progression toward higher levels of autonomy, safety and convenience. Analysts estimate that 19% of new vehicles sold globally in 2025 will have Level 2 (i.e., partial driving automation) or higher autonomy, compared to an estimated 9% of new vehicles sold globally in 2022 (Strategy Analytics, October 2022).\n\nTransforming Other Industries: IoT. Demand for connected devices beyond smartphones continued to grow across consumer, edge networking and industrial applications in fiscal 2022, in part due to the expanded use cases enabled by 5G technologies. The installed base of IoT devices, which includes everything from wearables to industrial handhelds to gateways, is projected to more than double between 2022 and 2026 to over 27 billion (IoT Analytics, October 2022). The growth in IoT devices is an important catalyst in driving digital transformation across industries.\n\nConsumer. Consumer IoT products continue to adopt the latest mobile connectivity, processing and intelligence technologies, including personal computing (e.g., tablets and personal computers), connected audio (e.g., wireless earbuds, speakers and soundbars), wearables (e.g., smart watches), XR devices (e.g., VR headsets and AR glasses) and others (e.g., camera and video collaboration, exercise equipment and home appliances). This is enabling new services, applications and experiences.\n\nEdge Networking. Growth in demand for connected devices, the transition to hybrid work environments and advances in wireless technology are driving increased demand for edge networking products (including mobile broadband and wireless access points). 5G provides the flexibility to support both mobile and fixed wireless users with the delivery of high-speed, low-latency connections, enabling operators to replace traditional 'last-mile' wired broadband connections. Additionally, advancements in WiFi are driving consumer and enterprise demand for the latest Wi-Fi 6 and 6E access point technologies that leverage increased network speed, capacity and efficiency to support the increased number of connected devices at home and at work.\n\nIndustrial. The combination of IoT devices with connectivity, computing and on-device AI along with the cloud are helping to bring near real-time data and insights in industries such as retail, transportation, logistics, mining and energy. This allows companies to gain new knowledge and insights about their products and services, manufacturing processes and more, which should help to transform, optimize and innovate their business.\n\n## Technology Overview\n\nThe worldwide demand for wireless devices, data services and applications requires continuous innovation to improve the user experiences, support new services, increase network capacity, make use of different frequency bands and allow for dense network deployments. To meet these requirements, different wireless communications technologies continue to evolve. We have a long history of investing heavily in research and development and have developed foundational technologies, including CDMA and OFDMA, that help drive the continued evolution of the wireless industry. As a result, we have developed and acquired (and continue to develop and acquire) significant related intellectual property. This intellectual property has been incorporated into the most widely accepted and deployed cellular wireless communications technology standards, and we have licensed it to several hundred licensees, including all of the leading handset manufacturers.\n\nCellular Wireless Technologies. Relevant cellular wireless technologies can be grouped into the following categories.\n\nCDMA-based. CDMA-based technologies are characterized by their access method allowing several users to share the same frequency and time by allocating different orthogonal codes to individual users. Most of the CDMA-based technologies are classified as 3G technology and provide vastly improved capacity for voice and low-rate data services as compared to analog technologies and significant improvements over earlier technologies (e.g., 2G technology). CDMA-based connections worldwide continue to decline as consumers migrate to OFDMA-based technologies, which comprise the majority of total cellular connections today.",

By 2024, Frame.io had transitioned from being a newly acquired integration to being positioned as a core component of Adobe's creative collaboration suite, directly integrated with key applications such as Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, Photoshop, and Workfront. Additionally, in 2024, Frame.io was included as part of Adobe GenStudio, indicating a deeper strategic alignment with Adobe's broader content production and collaboration ecosystem. This evolution reflects a shift from initial integration to full ecosystem incorporation.",

The estimated fair value of these obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost buildup approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin.\n\nUnanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\n\n## Accounting for Income Taxes\n\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the  expected  future  tax  consequences  of  temporary  differences  between  the  financial  reporting  and  tax  bases  of  assets  and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\nOur assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. In addition, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service  and  other  domestic  and  foreign  tax  authorities.  These  tax  examinations  are  expected  to  focus  on  our  research  and development tax credits, intercompany transfer pricing practices and other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from these examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, we cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have a significant impact on the amounts provided for income taxes in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nSee Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements that are of significance, or potential significance to us.\n\n## ACQUISITIONS\n\nIn  the  fourth  quarter  of  fiscal  2021,  we  completed  the  acquisition  of  Frame.io,  a  privately  held  company  that  provides  a cloud-based  video  collaboration  platform,  for  approximately  $1.18  billion  and  we  began  integrating  Frame.io  into  our  Digital Media reportable segment. In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we completed the acquisition of Workfront, a privately held company that provides a workflow platform, for approximately $1.52 billion in cash consideration and we began integrating Workfront into our Digital Experience reportable segment.\n\nSee Note 3 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these acquisitions.",

In  our  Digital  Experience  segment,  we  continued  to  experience growth in software-based subscription revenue across our portfolio of offerings. Our financial results for fiscal 2021 benefited from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to our 52/53 week financial calendar whereby fiscal 2021 is a 53-week year compared with fiscal 2020 and 2019 which were 52-week years.\n\n## Digital Media\n\nIn our Digital Media segment, we are a market leader with Creative Cloud, our subscription-based offering which provides desktop tools, mobile apps and cloud-based services for designing, creating and publishing rich and immersive content. Creative Cloud  delivers  value  with  deep,  cross-product  integration,  frequent  product  updates  and  feature  enhancements,  cloud-enabled services  including  storage  and  syncing  of  files  across  users'  machines,  machine  learning  and  artificial  intelligence,  access  to marketplace,  social  and  community-based  features  with  our Adobe  Stock  and  Behance  services,  app  creation  capabilities,  tools which assist with enterprise deployments and team collaboration, and affordable pricing for cost-sensitive customers.\n\nWe offer Creative Cloud for individuals,  students,  teams  and  enterprises. We  expect  Creative  Cloud  will  drive  sustained long-term  revenue  growth  through  a  continued  expansion  of  our  customer  base  by  attracting  new  users  with  new  features  and products, continuing to acquire users with our low cost of entry and delivery of additional features and value to Creative Cloud, and delivering new features and technologies to existing customers with our latest releases. We have also built out a marketplace for Creative Cloud subscribers to enable the delivery and purchase of stock content in our Adobe Stock service. Overall, our strategy with  Creative  Cloud  is  designed  to  enable  us  to  increase  our  revenue  with  users,  attract  more  new  customers,  and  grow  our recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably.\n\nWe continue to implement strategies that are designed to accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our Creative Cloud offerings. These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive, such as offering new desktop  and  mobile  applications,  as  well  as  targeted  promotions  and  offers  that  attract  past  customers  and  potential  users  to experience and ultimately subscribe to Creative Cloud. Because of the shift towards Creative Cloud subscriptions and Enterprise Term  License Agreements  ('ETLAs'),  revenue  from  perpetual  licensing  of  our  Creative  products  has  been  immaterial  to  our business.\n\nIn October 2021, we acquired Frame.io, a privately held company that provides a cloud-based video collaboration platform, and we began integrating Frame.io into our Digital Media segment.\n\nWe  are  also  a  market  leader  with  our  Document  Cloud  offerings  built  around  our  Adobe  Acrobat  family  of  products, including Adobe Acrobat Reader DC, and a set of integrated mobile apps and cloud-based document services, including Adobe Scan  and  Adobe  Sign.  Acrobat  provides  reliable  creation  and  exchange  of  electronic  documents,  regardless  of  platform  or application source type. Document Cloud, which we believe enhances the way people manage critical documents at home, in the office and across devices, includes Adobe Acrobat DC and Adobe Sign, and a set of integrated services enabling users to create, review, approve, sign and track documents whether on a desktop or mobile device. Adobe Acrobat DC is offered both through subscription and perpetual licenses.\n\nAs part of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud strategies, we utilize a data-driven operating model ('DDOM') and our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions to raise awareness of our products, drive new customer acquisition, engagement and retention, and optimize customer journeys. As a result, we observed strong growth in Digital Media revenue during fiscal 2021.\n\nAnnualized Recurring Revenue ('ARR') is currently the key performance metric our management uses to assess the health and  trajectory  of  our  overall  Digital  Media  segment.  ARR  should  be  viewed  independently  of  revenue,  deferred  revenue  and remaining performance obligations as ARR is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. We adjust our reported ARR on an annual basis to reflect any exchange rate changes. Our reported ARR results in the",

With  content  creation, consumption and monetization happening across all surfaces and media types, we aim to deliver new ways to unleash creativity and accelerate document productivity, and we believe this is an area of significant opportunity for growth through expansion of our customer base. We aim to achieve this by using data-driven customer engagement, driving product-led growth through innovation to make our creative applications more accessible and easier to learn and meeting customer needs holistically to increase the value of our products.\n\nWe continue to redefine the creative process with Creative Cloud, so that our customers can connect with everything and everyone they need to create, collaborate and be inspired. We are empowering content-first, task-based creativity with our launch of Creative Cloud Express, a web and mobile application with a content- and template-first experience to enable a broad spectrum of users, including novice content creators, communicators and creative professionals, to create, edit and customize content quickly and easily, in December 2021. We aim to continue to advance every creative category across desktop, web and mobile. We have delivered our flagship applications, including Photoshop, Illustrator and Lightroom, on desktop and mobile devices to allow users the ability to work from anywhere on any device and to collaborate with stakeholders. We are building collaboration deeply into our applications and workflows to enable seamless collaboration across stakeholders. We are taking Creative Cloud to the web, beginning with a public beta version of Photoshop, which will allow Creative Cloud subscribers to make edits to and collaborate on their files directly in their browser. We are continuing to focus on democratizing 3D and immersive content creation with Adobe Aero and our Substance suite of products, as well as through integrating our Substance 3D capabilities into our other applications. We continue to introduce new features and solutions in our products, such as auto-masking and new and improved neural filters in Photoshop, auto-captioning in Premiere, adjustment layers and perspective grids in Adobe Fresco and additional motion features in Adobe  XD. We  are  pursuing  new  ways  to  inspire,  empower  and  connect  the  creative  community,  such  as  through  our  Create Change series, our creative residency program and supporting live, interactive tutorials with creators on Behance. We also offer a range  of  other  creative  tools  and  services,  including  hobbyist  products,  such  as  Photoshop  Elements  and  Premiere  Elements; libraries  of  creative  assets,  such  as Adobe  Stock  and Adobe  Fonts;  mobile-first  apps,  such  as  Photoshop  Camera;  and  Creative Cloud Libraries, a central place for users to store their assets. Further descriptions of our Digital Media products are included below under 'Principal Products and Services.'\n\nOn October 7, 2021, Adobe acquired Frame.io and began integrating its leading cloud-based video collaboration platform into  Adobe  Creative  Cloud.  With  the  acquisition  of  Frame.io,  we  aim  to  make  the  creative  process  even  more  collaborative, productive  and  efficient  by  enhancing  Adobe  Creative  Cloud  with  Frame.io's  cloud-native  collaboration  workflows,  while continuing  to  enable  third-party  applications.  As  a  first  step  in  this  direction,  we  are  more  deeply  integrating  and  enhancing Frame.io's review and approval capabilities in Premiere Pro and After Effects to deliver a native collaborative platform for video editing.\n\nIn our Creative Cloud business, we continue to employ a pricing strategy, as appropriate, to move our customers to bettervalue offerings as well as attract past customers and potential users to try out our products and ultimately subscribe. As part of our strategy, we use a data-driven operating model and our Digital Experience solutions offered through Adobe",

      "answer": "In 2022, Substance 3D Stager was listed among Adobe's trademarks, indicating it was an established product within the company's portfolio but without detailed information about its functionality or strategic positioning. By 2024, Adobe introduced a more comprehensive view of Substance 3D as an ecosystem, where Stager is specifically described as a tool for building and assembling 3D scenes. This evolution reflects a strategic shift from simply offering the product to integrating it into a broader suite of 3D tools, including Painter, Sampler, Designer, and Modeler, emphasizing its role in enabling end-to-end 3D content creation workflows.",

      "question": "How did AMD's strategic positioning and financial dependency on semi-custom SoC products evolve between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of revenue structure and segment alignment?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AMD's revenue from semi-custom SoC products was described as dependent on third-party product success, with no control over marketing efforts, and revenue tied directly to third-party sales. This dependency was not quantified but was described as a risk to operating results. By 2023, semi-custom SoC products were explicitly categorized under the Gaming segment and listed as a core component alongside discrete GPUs, signaling a more strategic and integrated role. The 2023 filing also included a summary table of net revenue and operating income by segment for 2023, 2022, and 2021, which allowed for cross-year financial comparison, although specific figures for semi-custom SoC revenue were not disclosed. This evolution suggests a shift from a passive dependency to a more active strategic positioning within a key revenue-generating segment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, AMD described semi-custom SoC revenue as being entirely dependent on third-party product success, with no control over marketing or sales outcomes, highlighting it as a risk factor.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, semi-custom SoC products were formally grouped under the Gaming segment alongside discrete GPUs, indicating a more central and strategic role in AMD's business structure.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a shift from a risk-laden dependency to a more integrated and strategic product line, though exact revenue figures for semi-custom SoC products in either year were not disclosed in the provided evidence."

          "chunk_text": "The  success  of  our  business  is  dependent  upon  our  ability  to  introduce  products  on  a  timely  basis  with features  and  performance  levels  that  provide  value  to  our  customers  while  supporting  and  coinciding  with significant industry transitions.\n\nOur success depends to a significant extent on the development, qualification, implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers. Our ability to develop, qualify and distribute, and  have  manufactured,  new  products  and  related  technologies  to  meet  evolving  industry  requirements,  at  prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis, are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target  markets.  As  consumers  have  new  product  feature  preferences  or  have  different  requirements  than  those consumers in the PC market, PC sales could be negatively impacted, which could adversely impact our business. Our product  roadmap  includes  our  next-generation  AMD  Ryzen\u2122,  AMD  Radeon\u2122  and AMD  EPYC\u2122  processors.  We cannot assure you that our efforts to execute our product roadmap will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers. If we fail to or are delayed in developing, qualifying or shipping new products or technologies that provide value to our customers and address these new trends or if we fail to predict which new form factors consumers will adopt and adjust our business accordingly, we may lose competitive positioning, which could cause  us  to  lose  market  share  and  require  us  to  discount  the  selling  prices  of  our  products.  Although  we  make substantial investments in research and development, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully  implement  new  products  and  technologies  on  a  timely  basis  or  that  they  will  be  well-received  by  our customers. Moreover, our investments in new products and technologies involve certain risks and uncertainties and could disrupt our ongoing business. New investments may not generate sufficient revenue, may incur unanticipated liabilities  and  may  divert  our  limited  resources and distract management from our current operations. We cannot be certain that our ongoing investments in new products and technologies will be successful, will meet our expectations and will not adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results.\n\nDelays in developing, qualifying or shipping new products can also cause us to miss our customers' product design windows or, in some cases, breach contractual obligations or cause us to pay penalties. If our customers do not include our products in the initial design of their computer systems or products, they will typically not use our products in their systems  or  products  until  at  least  the  next  design  configuration.  The  process  of  being  qualified  for  inclusion  in  a customer's system or product can be lengthy and could cause us to further miss a cycle in the demand of end-users, which also could result in a loss of market share and harm our business. We also depend on the success and timing of our customers' platform launches. If our customers delay their product launches or if our customers do not effectively market their platforms with our products, it could result in a delay in bringing our products to market and cause us to miss a cycle in  the  demand  of  end-users,  which  could  materially  adversely  affect  our  business.  In  addition,  market demand requires that products incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry-wide basis. Over the  life  of  a  specific  product,  the  sale  price  is  typically  reduced  over  time.  The  introduction  of  new  products  and enhancements  to  existing  products  is  necessary  to  maintain  the  overall  corporate  average  selling  price.  If  we  are unable  to  introduce  new  products  with  sufficiently  high  sale  prices  or  to  increase  unit  sales  volumes  capable  of offsetting the reductions in the sale prices of existing products over time, our business could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Our revenue from our semi-custom SoC products is dependent upon our semi-custom SoC products being incorporated into customers' products and the success of those products.\n\nThe  revenue  that  we  receive  from  our  semi-custom  SoC  products  is  in  the  form  of  non-recurring  engineering  fees charged to third parties  for  design  and  development  services  and  revenue  received  in  connection  with  sales  of  our semi-custom SoC products to these third parties. As a result, our ability to generate revenue from our semi-custom products depends on our ability to secure customers for our semi-custom design pipeline, our customers' desire to pursue the project and our semi-custom SoC products being incorporated into those customers' products. Any revenue from sales of our semi-custom SoC products is directly related to sales of the third-party's products and reflective of their  success in the market. Moreover, we have no control over the marketing efforts of these third parties, and we cannot make any assurances that sales of their products will be successful in current or future years. Consequently, the semi-custom  SoC  product  revenue  expected  by  us  may  not  be  fully  realized  and  our  operating  results  may  be adversely affected.",

For transactions where we reimburse a customer for a portion of the customer's cost to perform specific  product advertising or marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition.\n\nWe also provide limited product return rights to certain OEMs and to most distribution customers. These return rights are generally limited to a contractual percentage of the customer's prior quarter shipments, although, from time to time we may approve additional product returns beyond the contractual arrangements based on the applicable facts and circumstances. In order to estimate adjustments to revenue to account for these returns, including product restocking rights  provided  to  distributor  and  OEM  customers,  we  utilize  relevant,  trended  actual  historical  product  return  rate information gathered, adjusted for actual known information or events, as applicable.\n\nOverall, our estimates of adjustments to contract price due to variable consideration under our contracts with OEM and distributor  customers,  based  on  our  assumptions  and  include  adjustments,  if  any,  for  known  events,  have  been materially consistent with actual results; however, these estimates are subject to management's judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and operating results.\n\nInventory Valuation. We value inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Material assumptions we use to estimate necessary inventory carrying value adjustments can be unique to each product and are based on specific facts and circumstances. In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for products, we consider assumptions such as changes in business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for our products, and changes in technology or customer requirements. In determining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves, we consider assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling prices, as well as estimates of future selling prices. If in any period we anticipate a change in assumptions such as future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales, resulting in a negative impact to our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that had been written down to a level below the ultimate realized selling price in a previous period, related revenue would be recorded with a lower or no offsetting charge to cost of sales resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period. Overall, our estimates of inventory carrying value adjustments have been materially consistent with actual results.\n\nGoodwill. We perform our goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment.\n\nWe first analyze qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, share price trends and market capitalization and Company-specific events. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we do not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test.\n\nIf  we  conclude  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  the  fair  value  of  the  reporting  unit  is  less  than  its  carrying  value,  a quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. A quantitative impairment analysis, if necessary, considers the income approach, which requires estimates of the present  value  of  expected  future  cash  flows  to  determine  a  reporting  unit's  fair  value.  Significant  estimates  include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, discount rates, and future economic and market conditions.",

          "chunk_text": "In addition to traditional graphics markets, there is a large and growing demand for accelerated computing, powered by graphics  processors  in  markets  such  as  high  performance  computing  (HPC),  artificial  intelligence,  and  Cloud Visualization  (Virtual  Desktop  Infrastructure  &amp;  Cloud  Gaming). Another  area  of  the  market  for  graphics  compute  is blockchain technology, which is a decentralized digital ledger used to securely store, transmit and process sensitive and  valuable  data.  Blockchain  applications  are  typically  performed  using  specially  designed  application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) or a general-purpose CPU or GPU.\n\n## Our Computing Products\n\nOur  microprocessors  are  incorporated  into  computing  platforms,  which  are  a  collection  of  technologies  that  are designed  to  work  together  to  provide  a  more  complete  computing  solution.  We  believe  that  integrated,  balanced computing platforms consisting of microprocessors, chipsets (either as discrete devices or integrated into an SoC) and GPUs (either as discrete GPUs or integrated into an APU or SoC) that work together at the system level bring end users improved system stability, increased performance and enhanced power efficiency. In addition, we believe our customers also benefit from an all-AMD platform (consisting of an APU or CPU, a discrete GPU, and a chipset when needed), as we are able to optimize interoperability, provide our customers a single point of contact for the key platform components and enable them to bring the platforms to market quickly in a variety of PC and server system form factors.\n\nWe  currently  base  our  microprocessors  and  chipsets  on  the  x86  instruction  set  architecture  and  the  AMD  Infinity Fabric\u2122,  which  connects  an  on-chip  memory  controller  and  input/output  (I/O)  channels  directly  to  one  or  more microprocessor cores. We typically integrate two or more processor cores onto a single die, and each core has its own dedicated cache, which is memory that is located on the semiconductor die, permitting quick access to frequently used data and instructions. Some of our microprocessors have additional levels of cache such as L2, or second-level cache, and L3, or third-level cache, to enable fast data access and high-performance.\n\nWe focus on continually improving the energy efficiency of our products through our design principles and innovations in  power  management  technology. To  that  end,  we  offer  CPUs,  GPUs, APUs,  SoCs  and  chipsets  with  multiple  low power states that  are  designed  to  utilize  lower  clock  speeds  and  voltages  to  reduce  processor  power  consumption during active and idle times. The use of intelligent, dynamic power management is designed to create lower energy use by allowing compute applications to be completed quickly and efficiently, enabling a return to the ultra-low power idle state.  We  also  continually  strive  to  improve  security  features  in  our  products  to  help  our  customers  protect  their sensitive  information.  To  that  end,  we  offer  integrated  on-chip  security  features  and  other  security  features  our customers can choose to enable.\n\nDesktop  Microprocessors . Our  microprocessors  for  desktop  platforms  currently  include  the  AMD  Ryzen  series processors and AMD Athlon processors. Our AMD Ryzen 5000 Series desktop processor family powered by our 'Zen 3' core architecture has up to 16 cores and delivers across the board leadership performance for gamers and content creators.\n\nNotebook  Microprocessors . Our  mobile APUs,  including AMD  Ryzen  and AMD Athlon  mobile  processors  for  the consumer and commercial markets, combine both high levels of performance and efficiency for notebook PC platforms. In January 2021, we launched our AMD Ryzen 5000 Series Mobile Processors, which are powered with our 'Zen 3' core architecture and are designed for gamers, creators and professionals.\n\nCommercial  Microprocessors . We  offer  enterprise-class  desktop  and  notebook  PC  solutions  sold  as  AMD  PRO Mobile and AMD PRO desktop processors with Radeon graphics for the commercial market. AMD Ryzen PRO, AMD Threadripper  PRO  and  AMD  Athlon  PRO  series  solutions  are  designed  to  provide  enterprise  customers  with  the performance,  security  capabilities  and  business  features  such  as  enhanced  security  and  manageability,  platform longevity and extended image stability. We launched the AMD Ryzen PRO 5000 Series Mobile Processors powered with our 'Zen 3' core architecture for business laptops in March 2021.\n\nChipsets . We offer a full suite of chipset products to support our AMD Ryzen and Threadripper platforms, including the X570 chipset which supports PCIe\u00ae 4.0 (fourth generation Peripheral Component Interconnect Express motherboard interface) designed for enthusiast desktop platforms. We offer the B550 chipset and the A520 chipset for socket AM4 for 3rd Gen AMD Ryzen desktop processors and 5000 processors. In addition, we continue to offer the B450 and A320 chipsets  that  are  combined  with  AMD  Ryzen  processors  for  the  AM4  desktop  platform  for  the  performance  and affordable mainstream platforms segments. In the High-End Desktop (HEDT) and Workstation segments, we offer the TRX40 and the  WRX80 chipsets,  respectively,  to  support  the  3rd  Gen  Ryzen  Threadripper  and  Threadripper  PRO platforms offering high speed I/O and platform bandwidth.",

For additional information, see Note 6 (Business Combinations and Dispositions) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\nFinancing activities: The $385 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in the net purchases of shares as well as an increase in cash dividends paid, partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from share issuances. For additional information, see Note 14 (Shareholders' Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\nWe believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities.\n\nSubstantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. In addition, domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future.\n\n## Share Purchases and Redemptions\n\nWe  intend  to  continue  to  use  a  significant  portion  of  cash  generated  from  operations  for  share  repurchases  during  fiscal  2023.  The  number  of  shares  ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means.

      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, Accenture's investment in Duck Creek Technologies was valued at $223,166 (approximately 16% ownership), with the investment accounted for under the equity method. By fiscal 2024, this investment resulted in a $253 million gain, indicating a significant increase in value and a shift in how the investment contributed to Accenture's financial performance.

Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and our proportionate share of gains and losses of the investee are included as a component of Other income (expense), net.

As of August 31, 2022, the carrying amount of our investment was $138,902, and the estimated fair value of our approximately 16% ownership was $223,166. We account for the investment under the equity method because we have the ability to influence operations through the combination of our voting power and through other factors, such as representation on the board and our business relationship.\n\nFor equity securities without a readily determinable fair value, we use the fair value measurement alternative and measure the securities at cost less impairment, if any, plus or minus observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization\n\nSee table below for summary of depreciation on fixed assets, deferred transition amortization, intangible assets amortization and operating lease cost for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis also contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in 'Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements' and 'Risk Factors' in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nWe use the terms 'Accenture,' 'we,' 'our' and 'us' in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to 'fiscal 2024' means the 12-month period that ended on August 31, 2024. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.\n\nWe use the term 'in local currency' so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results 'in local currency' are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior-year period's foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results  where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.\n\n## Overview\n\nAccenture is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services and solutions across Strategy &amp; Consulting, Technology, Operations, Industry X  and Song. We serve clients in three geographic markets: North A merica, EM EA  (Europe, M iddle East and A frica) and Growth M arkets (A sia Pacific and Latin A merica). We combine our strength in technology and leadership in cloud, data and A I with unmatched industry experience, functional expertise and global delivery capability to help the world's leading organizations build their digital core, optimize their operations, accelerate revenue growth and enhance services-creating tangible value at speed and scale. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, our Latin A merica market unit will move from Growth M arkets to North America. With this change, North A merica will become the A mericas market and Growth M arkets will become the A sia Pacific market.\n\nOur results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, the overall inflationary environment and levels of business confidence. There continues to be significant economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which has impacted and may continue to impact our business. These conditions have slowed the pace and level of client spending, particularly for smaller contracts with a shorter duration and for our consulting services. Clients continue to prioritize large-scale transformations, which convert to revenue over a longer period.\n\n## Key Metrics\n\nKey metrics for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 are included below. We have presented operating income, operating margin, effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP or 'adjusted' basis to exclude the impact of $438 million and $1,063 million, respectively, in business optimization costs recorded during fiscal 2024 and 2023 and, with respect to effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share, the impact of a $253 million investment gain related to our investment in Duck Creek Technologies recorded during fiscal 2023 as discussed further in our Results of Operations. For additional information regarding business optimization costs, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant A ccounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\n- Revenues of $64.9 billion, an increase of 1% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currency;\n- New bookings of $81.2 billion, an increase of 13% in U.S. dollars and 14% in local currency;\n- Operating margin of 14.8% , compared to 13.7% in fiscal 2023; adjusted operating margin was 15.5% compared to 15.4% in fiscal 2023;\n- Diluted earnings per share of $11.44, a 6% increase over $10.77 for fiscal 2023; adjusted earnings per share increased 2% to $11.95 compared to $11.67 for fiscal 2023; and\n- Cash returned to shareholders of $7.8 billion, including share purchases of $4.5 billion and dividends of $3.2 billion.",

Each Class A ordinary share entitles its holder to a pro rata part of any dividend at the times and in the amounts, if any, which Accenture plc's Board of Directors from time to time determines to declare, subject to any preferred dividend rights attaching to any preferred shares.

Accenture plc will redeem Class X ordinary shares upon the redemption or exchange of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares so that the aggregate number of Class X ordinary shares outstanding at any time does not exceed the aggregate number of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares outstanding.

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, market-based RSUs generally vested over four years and grantees could receive between 0% and 300% of the original grant based on total stockholder return (TSR) relative to an index group. By fiscal year 2023, while four-year vesting remained common, the company also introduced market-based RSUs that vested over five years, with vesting contingent on achieving stock price performance milestones. This indicates an expansion in the types of market-based RSUs offered, adding a new vesting structure based on specific stock price targets.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, market-based RSUs vested over four years with payout based on TSR relative to peers.",

During fiscal year 2022, we repurchased and retired approximately 12 million shares of our common stock for $7 billion under this stock repurchase program.\n\nIn May 2022, our Board of Directors authorized another stock repurchase program to repurchase up to an additional $10 billion of our common stock from time to time through December 31, 2023.\n\nRepurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be effected through a variety of methods, including open market or privately negotiated purchases. The timing and amount of shares repurchased will depend on the stock price, business and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities, acquisition opportunities, and other factors. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific amount of shares of common stock, and the stock repurchase programs may be suspended or terminated at any time.\n\n## Equity Incentive Award Plan\n\n## 2012 Plan\n\nIn connection with the acquisition of BRCM, we assumed the BRCM 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the 'Original 2012 Plan') and outstanding unvested RSUs originally granted by BRCM under the Original 2012 Plan that were held by continuing employees. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, our stockholders approved the amendment and restatement of the Original 2012 Plan, now called Broadcom Inc. 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the 'Amended 2012 Plan'). Under the Amended 2012 Plan, we may grant to employees stock options and stock appreciation rights with an exercise price that is no less than the fair market value on the date of grant, restricted stock awards and RSUs. No participant may be granted such awards for more than an aggregate of 4 million shares in any fiscal year. Equity awards granted under the Amended 2012 Plan generally vest over four years. The Amended 2012 Plan reduced the number of shares available for new equity award grants to 20 million shares and removed the annual share replenishment provision provided under the Original 2012 Plan. Awards cancelled or forfeited and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations become available for future issuance. As of October 30, 2022, 21 million shares remained available for issuance under the Amended 2012 Plan.\n\nWe may grant market-based RSUs with both a service condition and a market condition as part of our equity compensation programs. The market-based RSUs generally vest over four years, subject to satisfaction of market conditions. During fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, we granted market-based RSUs under which grantees may receive the number of shares ranging from 0% to 300% of the original grant at vesting based upon the total stockholder return ('TSR') on our common stock on an absolute basis and as compared to the TSR of an index group of companies.\n\n## Employee Stock Purchase Plan\n\nThe ESPP provides eligible employees with the opportunity to acquire an ownership interest in us through periodic payroll deductions, based on a 6-month look-back period, at a price equal to the lesser of 85% of the fair market value of our common stock at either the beginning or the end of the relevant offering period. The ESPP is structured as a qualified employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. However, the ESPP is not intended to be a qualified pension, profit sharing or stock bonus plan under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and is not subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Broadcom identified the shift to cloud-based IT solutions as a risk that could adversely affect both the timing and volume of sales for its semiconductor products used in traditional enterprise data centers. By 2023, this risk remained, but the emphasis shifted to how the timing of new software contracts and renewals, including those without termination-for-convenience clauses, could cause operating results to fluctuate. This indicates that while the risk of cloud adoption impacting hardware sales persisted, Broadcom's exposure evolved to include greater concern over software contract dynamics tied to cloud services.",

These liabilities could be substantial and may include, among other things, the cost of defending lawsuits against these individuals, as well as stockholder derivative suits; civil or criminal fines and penalties; legal and other expenses; and expenses associated with the remedial measure, if any, which may be imposed.\n\n## Our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations.\n\nOur operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations may occur on a quarterly and annual basis and are due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to many of the risks described elsewhere in this 'Risk Factors' section, these factors include, among others:\n\n- the timing of launches by our customers of new product in which our products are included and changes in enduser demand for our customers' the products;\n- fluctuations in the levels of component or product inventories held by our customers;\n- the shift to cloud-based IT solutions and services, such as hyperscale computing, which may adversely affect the timing and volume of sales of our products for use in traditional enterprise data centers;\n- the timing of new software contracts and renewals, as well as the timing of any terminations of software contracts that require us to refund to customers any pre-paid amounts under the contract;\n- our ability to timely develop, introduce and market new products and technologies;\n- the timing and extent of our software license and subscription revenue, and other non-product revenue;\n- new product announcements and introductions by us or our competitors;\n- seasonality or other fluctuations in demand in our markets;\n- timing and amount of research and development and related new product expenditures, and the timing of receipt of any research and development grant monies; and\n- timing of any regulatory changes, particularly with respect to trade sanctions and customs duties and tariffs, and tax reform.\n\nThe foregoing factors are often difficult to predict, and these, as well as other factors, could materially adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results. In addition, a significant amount of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in nature. Any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our results of operations. As a result, we believe that quarterto-quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful or a reliable indicator of our future performance. If our operating results in one or more future quarters fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, a significant decline in the trading price of our common stock may occur, which may happen immediately or over time.\n\n## Failure to adjust our manufacturing and supply chain to accurately meet customer demand could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nWe make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, levels of reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourcing, internal fabrication utilization and other resource requirements, based on our estimates of customer requirements, which may not be accurate.",

          "chunk_text": "## ITEM 1. BUSINESS\n\n## Overview\n\nWe are a global technology leader that designs, develops and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. Our over 50-year history of innovation dates back to our diverse origins from HewlettPackard Company, AT&amp;T, LSI Corporation, Broadcom Corporation, Brocade Communications Systems LLC, CA, Inc. and Symantec Enterprise Security. Over the years, we have assembled a large team of semiconductor and software design engineers around the world. We maintain design, product and software development engineering resources at locations in the U.S., Asia, Europe and Israel, providing us with engineering expertise worldwide. We strategically focus our research and development resources to address niche opportunities in our target markets and leverage our extensive portfolio of U.S. and other patents, and other intellectual property ('IP') to integrate multiple technologies and create system-on-chip ('SoC') component and software solutions that target growth opportunities. We design products and software that deliver high-performance and provide mission critical functionality.\n\nWe develop semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor ('CMOS') based devices and analog III-V based products. We have a history of innovation in the semiconductor industry and offer thousands of products that are used in end products such as enterprise and data center networking, home connectivity, set-top boxes ('STB'), broadband access, telecommunication equipment, smartphones and base stations, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays. We differentiate ourselves through our high performance design and integration capabilities and focus on developing products for target markets where we believe we can earn attractive margins.\n\nOur infrastructure software solutions enable customers to plan, develop, automate, manage, and secure applications across mainframe, distributed, mobile, and cloud platforms. Many of the largest companies in the world, including most of the Fortune 500, and many government agencies rely on our software solutions to help manage and secure their on-premise and hybrid cloud environments. Our portfolio of industry-leading infrastructure and security software is designed to modernize, optimize, and secure the most complex hybrid environments, enabling scalability, agility, automation, insights, resiliency and security. We also offer mission critical fibre channel storage area networking ('FC SAN') products and related software in the form of modules, switches and subsystems incorporating multiple semiconductor products.\n\n## Business Strategy\n\nOur strategy is to combine best-of-breed technology leadership in semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions, with unmatched scale, on a common sales and administrative platform to deliver a comprehensive suite of infrastructure technology products to the world's leading business and government customers. We seek to achieve this through responsibly financed acquisitions of category-leading businesses and technologies, as well as investing extensively in research and development, to ensure our products retain their technology leadership. This strategy results in a robust business model designed to drive diversified and sustainable operating and financial results.\n\n## Products and Markets\n\n## Semiconductor Solutions\n\nSemiconductors are made by imprinting a network of electronic components onto a semiconductor wafer. These devices are designed to perform various functions such as processing, amplifying and selectively filtering electronic signals, controlling electronic system functions and processing, and transmitting and storing data. Our digital and mixed signal products are based on silicon wafers with CMOS transistors offering fast switching speeds and low power consumption, which are both critical design factors for the markets we serve. We also offer analog products, which are based on III-V semiconductor materials that have higher electrical conductivity than silicon, and thus tend to have better performance characteristics in radio frequency ('RF'), and optoelectronic applications. III-V refers to elements from the 3rd and 5th groups in the periodic table of chemical elements. Examples of these materials used in our products are gallium arsenide ('GaAs') and indium phosphide ('InP').\n\nWe provide semiconductor solutions for managing the movement of data in data center, service provider, enterprise and embedded networking applications. We provide a broad variety of RF semiconductor devices, wireless connectivity solutions, custom touch controllers and inductive charging solutions for the wireless market. We also provide semiconductor solutions for enabling the STB and broadband access applications and for enabling secure movement of digital data to and from host machines, such as servers, personal computers and storage systems, to the underlying storage devices, such as hard disk drives ('HDD') and solid-state drives ('SSD').\n\nOur product portfolio ranges from discrete devices to complex sub-systems that include multiple device types and may also incorporate firmware for interfacing between analog and digital systems. In some cases, our products include mechanical hardware that interfaces with optoelectronic or capacitive sensors. We focus on markets that require high quality and the",

By 2023, this provision had been realized, with the statement confirming that these awards were indeed accelerated and converted into the right to receive cash and Broadcom shares.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Remaining Performance Obligations\n\nRevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents the transaction price allocated to unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations. Remaining performance obligations include unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods, but do not include contracts for software, subscriptions or services where the customer is not committed. The customer is not considered committed when termination for convenience without payment of a substantive penalty exists, either contractually or through customary business practice. The majority of our customer software contracts include termination for convenience clauses without a substantive penalty and are not considered committed. Additionally, as a practical expedient, we have not included contracts that have an original duration of one year or less, nor have we included contracts with sales-based or usagebased royalties promised in exchange for a license of IP.\n\nCertain multi-year customer contracts in our semiconductor solutions segment contain firmly committed amounts and the remaining performance obligations under these contracts as of October 30, 2022 were approximately $23.6 billion. We expect approximately 28% of this amount to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. Although the majority of our software contracts are not deemed to be committed, our customers generally do not exercise their termination for convenience rights. In addition, the majority of our contracts for products, subscriptions and services have a duration of one year or less. Accordingly, our remaining performance obligations disclosed above are not indicative of revenue for future periods.\n\n## 4. Acquisitions\n\n## Pending Acquisition of VMware, Inc.\n\nOn May 26, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the 'VMware Merger Agreement') to acquire all of the outstanding shares of VMware, Inc. ('VMware') in a cash-and-stock transaction (the 'VMware Merger') that values VMware at approximately $61 billion based on the closing price of Broadcom common stock on May 25, 2022. We will also assume VMware's closing date outstanding debt, net of expected cash.\n\nUnder the terms of the VMware Merger Agreement, each share of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the VMware Merger will be indirectly converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder of such share of VMware common stock, either $142.50 in cash, without interest, or 0.2520 shares of Broadcom common stock. The stockholder election will be subject to proration, such that the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive cash and the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive Broadcom common stock, will, in each case, be equal to 50% of the aggregate number of shares of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the VMware Merger.\n\nWe will assume all outstanding VMware RSU awards and performance stock unit awards held by continuing employees. The assumed awards will be converted into RSU awards for shares of Broadcom common stock. All outstanding in-the-money VMware stock options and RSU awards held by non-employee directors will be accelerated and converted into the right to receive cash and shares of Broadcom common stock, in equal parts.\n\nEffective upon the effective time of the VMware Merger, one member of the VMware Board of Directors, to be mutually agreed by us and VMware, will be added to our Board of Directors.\n\nIn connection with the execution of the VMware Merger Agreement, we entered into a commitment letter on May 26, 2022, with certain financial institutions that committed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions of the commitment letter, a senior unsecured bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of $32 billion.\n\nThe VMware Merger, which is expected to be completed in our fiscal year ending October 29, 2023 ('fiscal year 2023'), is subject to satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976 and clearance under the antitrust laws of the European Union and certain other jurisdictions. On October 3, 2022, we registered approximately 59 million shares of our common stock. On November 4, 2022, VMware stockholders adopted the VMware Merger Agreement. We and VMware each have termination rights under the VMware Merger Agreement and, under specified circumstances, upon termination of the agreement, we and VMware would be required to pay the other a termination fee of $1.5 billion.",

By 2023, the 0.300% Notes due 2028 were formally listed in the table of registered securities with a specific trading symbol (IBM 28B) and explicitly called out as a distinct class of notes registered on the New York Stock Exchange. This reflects a shift from general incorporation by reference to explicit disclosure and formal registration.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, the 0.300% Notes due 2028 were mentioned as part of a broader list of debt instruments, with their rights defined in a prior Form 8-K filing and incorporated by reference into the 10-K.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the same 0.300% Notes due 2028 were given a distinct trading symbol (IBM 28B) and were explicitly included in the table of registered securities on the NYSE.",

      "answer": "In 2022, IBM disclosed the 6.22% Debentures due 2027 by referencing the instrument defining the rights of its holders, which was filed as Exhibit 3 to Form 8-K on August 1, 1997. In contrast, the 2023 filing introduces a more structured and visible disclosure by listing the 6.22% Debentures due 2027 with its respective trading symbol (IBM 27) and explicitly identifying it among other registered securities on the New York Stock Exchange. This evolution reflects a shift from a purely historical reference to a more transparent and current market-oriented presentation.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In the 2022 filing, the 6.22% Debentures due 2027 were referenced through an exhibit filed in 1997, indicating a passive disclosure approach focused on legal documentation.",
        "Step 2: In the 2023 filing, the 6.22% Debentures due 2027 were listed with a specific trading symbol (IBM 27) and included in the table of registered securities, aligning it with other actively traded instruments.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a transformation in how IBM presents the debentures, moving from a historical legal reference to a more market-transparent format, suggesting increased visibility or relevance of this instrument in 2023."

      "question": "How has Adobe Target's role within Adobe's customer journey solutions evolved from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023, and what does this evolution indicate about Adobe's strategic direction in AI-driven personalization?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, Adobe Target was described as part of a broader set of customer journey solutions, specifically noted alongside Marketo Engage, Adobe Campaign, and Journey Optimizer. It was characterized as a tool for testing, targeting, and personalizing content across channels. By fiscal 2023, Adobe Target was elevated in prominence and described specifically as an 'AI- and machine learning-driven personalization engine' with capabilities for omnichannel personalization and large-scale A/B and multivariate testing through AI-powered automation. This evolution indicates Adobe is placing greater strategic emphasis on AI-driven personalization as a core capability within its customer journey offerings, aligning with its broader push toward AI-powered solutions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify Adobe Target's description and positioning in the 2022 filing, where it was listed among several customer journey solutions without specific emphasis on AI or machine learning.",
        "Step 2: Identify Adobe Target's description in the 2023 filing, where it is explicitly called an 'AI- and machine learning-driven personalization engine' with automation capabilities.",
        "Step 3: Analyze the change in positioning, noting the increased emphasis on AI and automation in 2023, which suggests a strategic shift toward strengthening Adobe Target as a key differentiator in personalization technology."

      "answer": "In 2022, Adobe Experience Manager was described as a key solution under the 'Content and commerce' pillar, focused on helping customers manage, deliver, and optimize content delivery. It was also noted that Adobe Experience Manager was being enhanced with new features like Adobe Experience Manager Screens and improved integrations with Creative Cloud and Adobe Sign. By 2023, Adobe Experience Manager's role had evolved to be more deeply integrated within the broader Adobe Experience Cloud ecosystem, particularly in enabling shoppable experiences and being part of native integrations with other Adobe products such as Analytics, Target, and Creative Cloud. Additionally, in 2023, Adobe Experience Manager was highlighted as part of Adobe Workfront integrations, enabling teams to scale content production with greater speed and efficiency. This indicates a shift from a primarily content management focus to a more workflow-optimized and tightly integrated component of Adobe\u2019s digital experience platform.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Adobe Experience Platform was described as the foundational infrastructure for Adobe Experience Cloud, enabling data standardization and integration with Adobe Sensei to provide AI-powered services such as automated insights, sentiment analysis, and enhanced anomaly detection. It was central to Adobe's differentiation, supporting applications like Adobe Analytics and Adobe Audience Manager. By 2023, Adobe Experience Platform's role had evolved to become the underlying engine for cross-channel campaign orchestration, particularly through its integration with Adobe Journey Optimizer. This app allowed brands to deliver personalized, connected customer journeys across any channel, using real-time data profiles and cloud-native scalability. Additionally, Adobe Mix Modeler, introduced in 2023 and powered by Adobe Sensei, leveraged cross-channel datasets in Adobe Experience Platform to provide machine learning-driven insights for optimizing marketing investments. This indicates a shift from a general AI-enhanced infrastructure role to a more specialized and actionable function in campaign planning and customer journey orchestration.",

The  management  approach  designates  the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments.\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe,  Greater  China,  Japan  and  Rest  of  Asia  Pacific.  Americas  includes  both  North  and  South  America.  Europe  includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company's other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better  align  with  the  location  of  the  Company's  customers  and  distribution  partners  and  the  unique  market  dynamics  of  each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.'\n\nThe  Company  evaluates  the  performance  of  its  reportable  segments  based  on  net  sales  and  operating  income.  Net  sales  for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company's retail stores located in those  geographic  locations.  Operating  income  for  each  segment  includes  net  sales  to  third  parties,  related  cost  of  sales  and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development ('R&amp;D'), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes,  various  nonrecurring  charges  and  other  separately  managed  general  and  administrative  costs.  The  Company  does  not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.\n\n## Note 2 - Revenue\n\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

The segment reporting focused on net sales and operating income, with an emphasis on aligning with customer locations and regional market dynamics. By 2023, while the geographic segmentation remained consistent, there was an increased emphasis on service offerings tailored to the region, including AppleCare, Cloud Services, Digital Content, and Payment Services. These services were explicitly detailed in the 2023 filing, indicating a more integrated approach to regional operations that goes beyond hardware distribution.

The  management  approach  designates  the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments.\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe,  Greater  China,  Japan  and  Rest  of  Asia  Pacific.  Americas  includes  both  North  and  South  America.  Europe  includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company's other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better  align  with  the  location  of  the  Company's  customers  and  distribution  partners  and  the  unique  market  dynamics  of  each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.'\n\nThe  Company  evaluates  the  performance  of  its  reportable  segments  based  on  net  sales  and  operating  income.  Net  sales  for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company's retail stores located in those  geographic  locations.  Operating  income  for  each  segment  includes  net  sales  to  third  parties,  related  cost  of  sales  and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development ('R&amp;D'), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes,  various  nonrecurring  charges  and  other  separately  managed  general  and  administrative  costs.  The  Company  does  not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.\n\n## Note 2 - Revenue\n\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

By 2023, Apple's relationship with the App Store evolved from a 'depends on' model to an operational one, where the App Store is positioned as a core platform within Apple\u2019s broader services ecosystem, allowing customers to 'discover and download applications and digital content.' This shift reflects a more strategic and active operational role for the App Store, aligning it with other key services like Apple Arcade and Apple Music, rather than treating it solely as a third-party transaction intermediary.",

The  Company  considers  multiple  factors  when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store and certain digital content sold through the Company's other digital content stores, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.\n\nThe  Company  records  revenue  net  of  taxes  collected  from  customers  that  are  remitted  to  governmental  authorities,  with  the collected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.\n\n## Share-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date  of  grant,  and  recognizes  expense  on  a  straight-line  basis  for  its  estimate  of  equity  awards  that  will  ultimately  vest.

RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company's common stock on a one-for-one basis. RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of two  times  the  number  of  RSUs  granted.  RSUs  canceled  and  shares  withheld  to  satisfy  tax  withholding  obligations  increase  the number of shares available for grant under the 2022 Plan utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs canceled or shares withheld. All RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan have dividend equivalent rights ('DERs'), which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the underlying RSUs. A maximum of approximately 1.3 billion shares were authorized for issuance pursuant to 2022 Plan awards at the time the plan was approved on March 4, 2022.\n\n## 2014 Employee Stock Plan\n\nThe Apple Inc. 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the '2014 Plan') is a shareholder-approved plan that provided for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers. The 2014 Plan permitted the granting of substantially the same types of equity awards with substantially the same terms as the 2022 Plan. The 2014 Plan also permitted the granting of cash bonus awards. In the third quarter of 2022, the Company terminated the authority to grant new awards under the 2014 Plan.",

      "question": "How did Microsoft's strategic emphasis on AI integration within Microsoft Teams evolve between 2023 and 2024, and what does this suggest about its impact on the company's broader productivity and collaboration revenue growth?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Microsoft positioned Teams as a 'comprehensive platform for communication and collaboration' with core features like meetings, chat, and file collaboration, and emphasized its integration with Microsoft 365 and Copilot to deliver role-specific AI extensions such as Copilot for Sales and Service. By 2024, while maintaining this foundation, the narrative expanded to place greater emphasis on AI-driven workflows and deeper integration with Microsoft Graph and Copilot for Microsoft 365, suggesting a strategic shift toward positioning Teams not just as a collaboration tool but as a central AI-powered hub for business processes. This evolution indicates Microsoft's intent to drive increased adoption and monetization of Teams through AI capabilities, likely contributing to productivity and collaboration segment revenue growth, though specific figures are not disclosed in the provided excerpts.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, Microsoft described Teams as a comprehensive communication and collaboration platform, highlighting integrations with Microsoft 365 and early Copilot extensions for specific business roles.",

        "Step 3: The shift from a general collaboration platform to a more AI-centric, workflow-integrated hub suggests a strategic evolution aimed at enhancing monetization and driving productivity and collaboration revenue."

Our family of products plays a key role in the ways the world works, learns, and connects.\n\nOur growth depends on securely deliv ering continuous innov ation and adv ancing our leading productiv ity and collaboration tools and serv ices, including Microsoft 365, LinkedIn, and Dynamics 365. Microsoft 365 is an AI first platform that brings together Office, Windows, Copilot, and Enterprise Mobility + Security to help organizations empower their employees. Copilot for Microsoft 365 combines AI with business data in the Microsoft Graph and Microsoft 365 applications. Microsoft Teams is a comprehensiv e platform for communication and collaboration, with meetings, calling, chat, file collaboration, and the ability to bring all of the applications teams use into a single place. Microsoft Viv a is an employee experience platform that brings together communications, knowledge, learning, resources, and insights.\n\nTogether, the Microsoft Cloud, Dynamics 365, Microsoft Teams, and our AI offerings bring a new era of collaborativ e applications for ev ery role and business function to get insights and business impact faster. Dynamics 365 is a portfolio of intelligent business applications that deliv ers operational efficiency and breakthrough customer experiences. Our role-based extensions of Microsoft Copilot - Copilot for Sales, Copilot for Serv ice, and Copilot for Finance - bring together the power of Copilot for Microsoft 365 with role-specific insights and workflow assistance to streamline business processes. Copilot Studio allows customers to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own Copilot. Microsoft Power Platform helps domain experts driv e productiv ity gains with low-code/no-code tools, robotic process automation, v irtual agents, and business intelligence. Copilot Pro is a consumer subscription serv ice that offers faster and more powerful AI assistance in Microsoft 365 apps and on the web. LinkedIn combines our unique data with this new generation of AI to transform the way professionals learn, sell, market, and get hired.\n\n## Build the Intelligent Cloud and Intelligent Edge Platform\n\nDigital transformation and adoption of AI continues to rev olutionize more business workstreams for organizations in ev ery sector across the globe. For enterprises, digital technology empowers employees, optimizes operations, engages customers, and in some cases, changes the v ery core of products and serv ices. We continue to inv est in high performance and sustainable computing to meet the growing demand for fast access to Microsoft serv ices prov ided by our network of cloud computing and AI infrastructure and datacenters.\n\nOur cloud business benefits from three economies of scale: datacenters that deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; datacenters that coordinate and aggregate div erse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns, improv ing the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy locations that lower application maintenance labor costs.\n\nThe Microsoft Cloud prov ides the best integration across the technology stack while offering openness, improv ing time to v alue, reducing costs, and increasing agility. As the foundation of the Microsoft Cloud, Azure uniquely offers hybrid consistency, dev eloper productiv ity, data and AI capabilities, and trusted security and compliance.\n\nWe offer supercomputing power for AI at scale to run large workloads, complemented by our rapidly expanding portfolio of AI cloud serv ices and hardware, which includes custom-built silicon and strong partnerships with chip manufacturers. We hav e introduced purpose-built cloud infrastructure for AI workloads including a custom AI accelerator, Azure Maia, and a custom in-house central processing unit, Azure Cobalt.",

      "question": "How has Microsoft's positioning and emphasis on Copilot Pro evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of its role within Microsoft 365 apps and web-based AI assistance?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Copilot Pro was introduced as a consumer subscription service that offered 'faster and more powerful AI assistance in Microsoft 365 apps and on the web.' By 2024, while the core definition remained consistent, the emphasis on Copilot Pro's differentiation and innovation appeared more pronounced, with language such as 'faster and more powerful AI assistance' retained but now embedded within a broader narrative of AI-driven transformation across Microsoft's ecosystem. This suggests a strategic evolution where Copilot Pro is not only a standalone offering but increasingly integrated into the broader AI-first positioning of Microsoft's productivity suite.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, Copilot Pro was described as a consumer subscription service offering enhanced AI assistance in Microsoft 365 apps and on the web, indicating its initial positioning as a premium AI tool for consumers.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the description of Copilot Pro remained consistent in functional terms but was presented within a more expansive context of AI transformation, suggesting a deeper integration into Microsoft\u2019s broader AI strategy.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a shift from positioning Copilot Pro as a standalone consumer product to framing it as a key component of Microsoft\u2019s AI-first platform, aligning it more closely with enterprise-focused AI offerings like Copilot for Microsoft 365 and role-specific Copilots."

Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceiv e new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and dev elopment activ ities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitiv e forces.\n\n## Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks\n\nThe markets for software, dev ices, and cloud-based serv ices are dynamic and highly competitiv e. Our competitors are dev eloping new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based serv ices for consumers and businesses. The dev ices and form factors customers prefer ev olv e rapidly, influencing how users access serv ices in the cloud and, in some cases, the user's choice of which suite of cloud-based serv ices to use. Aggregate demand for our software, serv ices, and dev ices is also correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. We must continue to ev olv e and adapt ov er an extended time in pace with this changing env ironment.\n\nThe inv estments we are making in cloud and AI infrastructure and dev ices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. We continue to identify and ev aluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase our serv er capacity to meet the ev olv ing needs of our customers, particularly giv en the growing demand for AI serv ices. Our datacenters depend on the av ailability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and serv ers, including graphics processing units ('GPUs') and other components. Our dev ices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we hav e the ability to use other manufacturers if a current v endor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. Howev er, some of our products contain certain components for which there are v ery few qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture dev ices on time to meet consumer demand.\n\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of univ ersity and industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented indiv iduals globally by offering an exceptional working env ironment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one's career across many different products and businesses, and competitiv e compensation and benefits.\n\nOur international operations prov ide a significant portion of our total rev enue and expenses. Many of these rev enue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect rev enue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relativ e to certain foreign currencies did not hav e a material impact on reported rev enue and expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2024.\n\nRefer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nOur rev enue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. Fourth quarter rev enue is driv en by a higher v olume of multi-year contracts executed during the period.\n\n## Change in Accounting Estimate\n\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful liv es of our serv er and network equipment.

      "answer": "In 2023, Cisco's service revenue from the APJC region was $2,160 million, accounting for 15.6% of total service revenue. By 2024, this revenue increased to $2,249 million, representing a $89 million (4%) growth. However, its percentage of total service revenue slightly declined to 15.5%. Additionally, in 2024, Cisco's financial statements began emphasizing its stake in the APJC region through consolidated investments, indicating a deeper strategic involvement beyond mere operational presence. This evolution reflects both quantitative growth and a qualitative shift in Cisco's engagement with APJC.",

(the 'Company,' 'Cisco,' 'we,' 'us,' or 'our') is the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the last Saturday in July. Fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 were each 52-week fiscal years. The Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts and those of our subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. We conduct business globally and are primarily managed on a geographic basis in the following three geographic segments: the Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific, Japan, and China (APJC).\n\nOur consolidated financial statements include our accounts and investments consolidated under the voting interest model. The noncontrolling interests attributed to these investments are not presented as a separate component in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets as these amounts are not material for any of the  fiscal  periods  presented.  The  share  of  earnings  attributable  to  the  noncontrolling  interests  are  not  presented  separately  in  the  Consolidated  Statements  of Operations as these amounts are not material for any of the fiscal periods presented.\n\nCertain reclassifications have been made to the amounts for prior years in order to conform to the current year's presentation. We have evaluated subsequent events through the date that the financial statements were issued.\n\n## 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n(a) Cash and Cash Equivalents   We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with various financial institutions.\n\n(b) Available-for-Sale Debt Investments   We classify our investments in fixed income securities as available-for-sale debt investments. Our available-for-sale debt investments  primarily  consist  of  U.S.  government,  U.S.  government  agency,  non-U.S.  government  and  agency,  corporate  debt,  U.S.  agency  mortgage-backed securities, commercial paper and certificates of deposit. These available-for-sale debt investments are primarily held in the custody of a major financial institution. A specific identification method is used to determine the cost basis of available-for-sale debt investments sold. These investments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on these investments are included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), net of tax . We classify our investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.\n\n(c) Equity Instruments Our equity investments are accounted for as follows:\n\n- Marketable equity securities have readily determinable fair value (RDFV) that are measured and recorded at fair value through income.\n- Non-marketable equity securities do not have RDFV and are measured using a measurement alternative recorded at cost less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes. For certain of these securities, we have elected to apply the net asset value (NAV ) practical expedient. The NAV is the estimated fair value of these investments.\n- Equity method investments are securities we do not control, but are able to ex ert significant influence over the investee. These investments are measured at cost less any impairment, plus or minus our share of equity method investee income or loss.\n\n(d) Impairments of Investments   For our available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss ex ists. In this assessment, among other factors, we consider the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security. If factors indicate a credit loss ex ists, an allowance for credit loss is recorded to other income (loss), net, limited by  the  amount  that  the  fair  value  is  less  than  the  amortized  cost  basis.  The  amount  of  fair  value  change  relating  to  all  other  factors  is  recognized  in  other comprehensive income (OCI).\n\nWe hold non-marketable equity and other investments ('privately held investments') which are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We monitor these investments for impairments and make reductions in carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required based primarily on the financial condition and near-term prospects of these companies.",

By 2024, the relationship evolved to include a more nuanced investment structure, with Cisco holding various types of equity investments, including marketable equity securities, non-marketable equity securities, and equity method investments in the region.

(the 'Company,' 'Cisco,' 'we,' 'us,' or 'our') is the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the last Saturday in July. Fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 were each 52-week fiscal years. The Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts and those of our subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. We conduct business globally and are primarily managed on a geographic basis in the following three geographic segments: the Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific, Japan, and China (APJC).\n\nOur consolidated financial statements include our accounts and investments consolidated under the voting interest model. The noncontrolling interests attributed to these investments are not presented as a separate component in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets as these amounts are not material for any of the  fiscal  periods  presented.  The  share  of  earnings  attributable  to  the  noncontrolling  interests  are  not  presented  separately  in  the  Consolidated  Statements  of Operations as these amounts are not material for any of the fiscal periods presented.\n\nCertain reclassifications have been made to the amounts for prior years in order to conform to the current year's presentation. We have evaluated subsequent events through the date that the financial statements were issued.\n\n## 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n(a) Cash and Cash Equivalents   We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with various financial institutions.\n\n(b) Available-for-Sale Debt Investments   We classify our investments in fixed income securities as available-for-sale debt investments. Our available-for-sale debt investments  primarily  consist  of  U.S.  government,  U.S.  government  agency,  non-U.S.  government  and  agency,  corporate  debt,  U.S.  agency  mortgage-backed securities, commercial paper and certificates of deposit. These available-for-sale debt investments are primarily held in the custody of a major financial institution. A specific identification method is used to determine the cost basis of available-for-sale debt investments sold. These investments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on these investments are included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), net of tax . We classify our investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.\n\n(c) Equity Instruments Our equity investments are accounted for as follows:\n\n- Marketable equity securities have readily determinable fair value (RDFV) that are measured and recorded at fair value through income.\n- Non-marketable equity securities do not have RDFV and are measured using a measurement alternative recorded at cost less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes. For certain of these securities, we have elected to apply the net asset value (NAV ) practical expedient. The NAV is the estimated fair value of these investments.\n- Equity method investments are securities we do not control, but are able to ex ert significant influence over the investee. These investments are measured at cost less any impairment, plus or minus our share of equity method investee income or loss.\n\n(d) Impairments of Investments   For our available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss ex ists. In this assessment, among other factors, we consider the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security. If factors indicate a credit loss ex ists, an allowance for credit loss is recorded to other income (loss), net, limited by  the  amount  that  the  fair  value  is  less  than  the  amortized  cost  basis.  The  amount  of  fair  value  change  relating  to  all  other  factors  is  recognized  in  other comprehensive income (OCI).\n\nWe hold non-marketable equity and other investments ('privately held investments') which are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We monitor these investments for impairments and make reductions in carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required based primarily on the financial condition and near-term prospects of these companies.",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2023, Cisco's APJC operations generated a gross margin of $5,187 million, representing 67.2% of the region's revenue, indicating strong profitability. By fiscal 2024, while the company continued to operate in the APJC region, it reclassified its relationship with certain entities in the region to 'Has_Stake_In,' signaling a shift from direct operational control to a more investment-focused approach. This change suggests a strategic recalibration, possibly to manage regional complexities or regulatory environments, without compromising the region's overall contribution to Cisco's global performance.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Cisco directly operated in the APJC region as one of its three geographic segments, indicating a strong operational presence focused on delivering products and services. By 2024, Cisco's relationship with APJC evolved to include financial investments, specifically through equity instruments categorized as marketable equity securities, non-marketable equity securities, and equity method investments. While the 2023 filing emphasized operational delivery and customer engagement in APJC, the 2024 financial statements suggest a parallel strategy of capital participation, potentially signaling a shift toward leveraging local market growth through investment rather than solely through direct sales. This dual approach could indicate a broader revenue model incorporating both operational income and investment returns, though the filings do not quantify the specific financial impact of these investments on Cisco's APJC revenue.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 1. Basis of Presentation\n\nThe fiscal year for Cisco Systems, Inc. (the 'Company,' 'Cisco,' 'we,' 'us,' or 'our') is the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the last Saturday in July. Fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 were each 52-week fiscal years. The Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts and those of our subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. We conduct business globally and are primarily managed on a geographic basis in the following three geographic segments: the Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific, Japan, and China (APJC).\n\nOur consolidated financial statements include our accounts and investments consolidated under the voting interest model. The noncontrolling interests attributed to these investments are not presented as a separate component in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets as these amounts are not material for any of the  fiscal  periods  presented.  The  share  of  earnings  attributable  to  the  noncontrolling  interests  are  not  presented  separately  in  the  Consolidated  Statements  of Operations as these amounts are not material for any of the fiscal periods presented.\n\nCertain reclassifications have been made to the amounts for prior years in order to conform to the current year's presentation. We have evaluated subsequent events through the date that the financial statements were issued.\n\n## 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n(a) Cash and Cash Equivalents   We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with various financial institutions.\n\n(b) Available-for-Sale Debt Investments   We classify our investments in fixed income securities as available-for-sale debt investments. Our available-for-sale debt investments  primarily  consist  of  U.S.  government,  U.S.  government  agency,  non-U.S.  government  and  agency,  corporate  debt,  U.S.  agency  mortgage-backed securities, commercial paper and certificates of deposit. These available-for-sale debt investments are primarily held in the custody of a major financial institution. A specific identification method is used to determine the cost basis of available-for-sale debt investments sold. These investments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on these investments are included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), net of tax . We classify our investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.\n\n(c) Equity Instruments Our equity investments are accounted for as follows:\n\n- Marketable equity securities have readily determinable fair value (RDFV) that are measured and recorded at fair value through income.\n- Non-marketable equity securities do not have RDFV and are measured using a measurement alternative recorded at cost less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes. For certain of these securities, we have elected to apply the net asset value (NAV ) practical expedient. The NAV is the estimated fair value of these investments.\n- Equity method investments are securities we do not control, but are able to ex ert significant influence over the investee. These investments are measured at cost less any impairment, plus or minus our share of equity method investee income or loss.\n\n(d) Impairments of Investments   For our available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss ex ists. In this assessment, among other factors, we consider the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security. If factors indicate a credit loss ex ists, an allowance for credit loss is recorded to other income (loss), net, limited by  the  amount  that  the  fair  value  is  less  than  the  amortized  cost  basis.  The  amount  of  fair  value  change  relating  to  all  other  factors  is  recognized  in  other comprehensive income (OCI).\n\nWe hold non-marketable equity and other investments ('privately held investments') which are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We monitor these investments for impairments and make reductions in carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required based primarily on the financial condition and near-term prospects of these companies.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the filing did not disclose specific growth figures or drivers for the Rest of Asia Pacific region, only describing its composition and general management approach. By 2024, the Rest of Asia Pacific saw net sales growth primarily driven by higher Services sales, though this was offset by an unfavorable currency impact due to the weakness of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. This marks a shift from the earlier period, where no specific performance drivers were reported, to a more defined growth pattern influenced by Services and currency fluctuations.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, the filing describes the Rest of Asia Pacific as a reportable segment but does not specify net sales figures or growth drivers for the region.",

        "Step 3: The evolution from 2022 to 2024 shows a transition from a lack of specific performance data to a clear identification of Services as a key growth driver, with currency effects now quantified as a headwind."

The  management  approach  designates  the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments.\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe,  Greater  China,  Japan  and  Rest  of  Asia  Pacific.  Americas  includes  both  North  and  South  America.  Europe  includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company's other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better  align  with  the  location  of  the  Company's  customers  and  distribution  partners  and  the  unique  market  dynamics  of  each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.'\n\nThe  Company  evaluates  the  performance  of  its  reportable  segments  based  on  net  sales  and  operating  income.  Net  sales  for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company's retail stores located in those  geographic  locations.  Operating  income  for  each  segment  includes  net  sales  to  third  parties,  related  cost  of  sales  and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development ('R&amp;D'), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes,  various  nonrecurring  charges  and  other  separately  managed  general  and  administrative  costs.  The  Company  does  not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.\n\n## Note 2 - Revenue\n\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, Apple acknowledged that changes to the App Store, including those in response to legal and market conditions, could reduce the volume of sales and the commission it earns on those sales, potentially affecting its financial condition. By 2024, Apple had implemented specific changes, particularly in the U.S. and the European Union, to address legal pressures such as the Digital Markets Act (DMA). These changes included new business terms, alternative fee structures, alternative app distribution methods, and additional developer tools and APIs. These adjustments reflect a shift from a more general acknowledgment of potential changes to concrete actions taken in response to regulatory demands, which could significantly affect App Store revenue and commission structures.",

          "chunk_text": "## The Company's future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\n\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company's products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company's products, customers may choose not to buy the Company's products.\n\nThe  Company  believes  the  availability  of  third-party  software  applications  and  services  for  its  products  depends  in  part  on  the developers' perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company's products compared to competitors' platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.\n\nThe Company's minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading  software  for  competitors'  products  with  larger  market  share.  When  developers  focus  their  efforts  on  these  competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company's devices can suffer.\n\nThe  Company  relies  on  the  continued  availability  and  development  of  compelling  and  innovative  software  applications  for  its products.  The  Company's  products  and  operating  systems  are  subject  to  rapid  technological  change,  and  when  third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences and can operate incorrectly and can result in dissatisfied customers.\n\nThe  Company  distributes  third-party  applications  for  its  products  through  the  App  Store.  For  the  vast  majority  of  applications, developers  keep  all  of  the  revenue  they  generate  on  the  App  Store.  The  Company  only  retains  a  commission  from  sales  of applications and sales of digital services or goods within an application. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App  Store,  including  actions  taken  in  response  to  competition,  market  and  legal  conditions.  The  Company  may  make  further business changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as the European Union ('EU') Digital Markets Act, could require further  changes.  The  Company  is  also  subject  to  litigation  and  investigations  relating  to  the  App  Store,  which  have  resulted  in changes to the Company's business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. These changes could include how and to what extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company's customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions  to,  third-party  content,  as  well  as  the  right  to  incorporate  specific  content  into  the  Company's  own  services.  The licensing  or  other  distribution  arrangements  for  this  content  can  be  for  relatively  short  time  periods  and  do  not  guarantee  the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors  currently  or  in  the  future  may  offer  competing  products  and  services,  and  can  take  actions  to  make  it  difficult  or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company's access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.\n\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent,  content  and  subscribers,  and  may fail  to  appeal  to  the  Company's  customers. The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused additional restrictions on production and increased costs for digital content.\n\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.",

This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.\n\nThe Company's minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors' products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company's devices can suffer.\n\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company's products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly , and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company's products.\n\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the A pp Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the A pp Store. Where applicable, the Company retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within  an  application.  From  time  to  time,  the  Company  has  made changes to its products and services, including taking actions in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements, and expects to make further business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S., the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS A pp Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. The Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the A pp Store and Safari in the European Union ('EU') as it seeks to comply with the Digital M arkets A ct (the 'DM A '), including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company's operating systems, and additional tools and application programming interfaces ('APIs') for developers. Changes to the Company's products and services could materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition, including if such business changes result in reduced A pp Store or other sales, reductions in the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales, or if the rate of the commission is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated. \u00ae\n\n## Failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company's customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company's own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relativ ely  short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company's access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.\n\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company's customers.\n\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the 2022 Employee Stock Plan was approved with a maximum of approximately 1.3 billion shares authorized for issuance, and RSUs granted under the plan reduced the available shares by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. By 2024, the plan continued to be in effect, with new award agreements under the 2022 Plan dated as of September 29, 2024, indicating ongoing utilization and potential refinement of the plan's structure. This demonstrates that while the foundational structure of the plan remained intact, its implementation evolved through the introduction of new award agreements, suggesting continued use and possible enhancements.",

RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company's common stock on a one-for-one basis. RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of two  times  the  number  of  RSUs  granted.  RSUs  canceled  and  shares  withheld  to  satisfy  tax  withholding  obligations  increase  the number of shares available for grant under the 2022 Plan utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs canceled or shares withheld. All RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan have dividend equivalent rights ('DERs'), which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the underlying RSUs. A maximum of approximately 1.3 billion shares were authorized for issuance pursuant to 2022 Plan awards at the time the plan was approved on March 4, 2022.\n\n## 2014 Employee Stock Plan\n\nThe Apple Inc. 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the '2014 Plan') is a shareholder-approved plan that provided for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers. The 2014 Plan permitted the granting of substantially the same types of equity awards with substantially the same terms as the 2022 Plan. The 2014 Plan also permitted the granting of cash bonus awards. In the third quarter of 2022, the Company terminated the authority to grant new awards under the 2014 Plan.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Apple explicitly emphasized managing the Rest of Asia Pacific segment separately to better align with the unique market dynamics of the region, which includes Australia and other Asian countries not covered in other segments. By 2024, while the Rest of Asia Pacific remains a distinct reportable segment with the same geographic definition, the specific mention of 'unique market dynamics' is no longer included in the description of the rationale for segmentation. This suggests a subtle shift away from highlighting differentiated market characteristics toward a more standardized geographic segmentation approach, even though the structural boundaries of the segment remain unchanged.",
      "reasoning_steps": [

The  management  approach  designates  the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments.\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe,  Greater  China,  Japan  and  Rest  of  Asia  Pacific.  Americas  includes  both  North  and  South  America.  Europe  includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company's other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better  align  with  the  location  of  the  Company's  customers  and  distribution  partners  and  the  unique  market  dynamics  of  each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.'\n\nThe  Company  evaluates  the  performance  of  its  reportable  segments  based  on  net  sales  and  operating  income.  Net  sales  for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company's retail stores located in those  geographic  locations.  Operating  income  for  each  segment  includes  net  sales  to  third  parties,  related  cost  of  sales  and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development ('R&amp;D'), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes,  various  nonrecurring  charges  and  other  separately  managed  general  and  administrative  costs.  The  Company  does  not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.\n\n## Note 2 - Revenue\n\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

Postretirement benefit plans\n\n## Plan descriptions\n\nWe have various employee retirement plans, including defined contribution, defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans. For qualifying employees, we offer deferred compensation arrangements.\n\n## U.S. retirement plans\n\nOur principal retirement plans in the United States are a defined contribution plan, an enhanced defined contribution plan and qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans. The defined benefit plans were closed to new participants in 1997, and then current participants were allowed to make a one-time election to continue accruing a benefit in the plans or to cease accruing a benefit and instead to participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan.\n\nBoth defined contribution plans offer an employer-matching savings option that allows employees to make pretax and post-tax contributions to various investment choices. Employees who elected to continue accruing a benefit in the qualified defined benefit pension plans may also participate in the defined contribution plan, where employer-matching contributions are provided for up to 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings. Employees who elected not to continue accruing a benefit in the defined benefit pension plans and employees hired after November 1997 and through December 31, 2003, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. This plan provides for a fixed employer contribution of 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings, plus an employer-matching contribution of up to 4% of the employee's annual eligible earnings. Employees hired after December 31, 2003, do not receive the fixed employer contribution of 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, as a result of employees' elections, TI's U.S. defined contribution plans held shares of TI common stock totaling 6 million shares and 7 million shares valued at $1.16 billion and $1.12 billion, respectively. Dividends paid on these shares in both 2021 and 2020 were $27 million. Effective April 1, 2016, the TI common stock fund was frozen to new contributions or transfers into the fund.\n\nOur aggregate expense for the U.S. defined contribution plans was $63 million in 2021 and $61 million in 2020 and 2019.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Texas Instruments described Embedded Processing as one of its core product lines within a broader business model that emphasized four competitive advantages: manufacturing and technology strength, a broad product portfolio, strong market channels, and product diversity and longevity. Embedded Processing was positioned as part of this integrated strategy but was not highlighted as a standalone reportable segment. By 2024, Embedded Processing was elevated to a reportable segment alongside Analog, indicating a strategic shift where the company explicitly called out Embedded Processing as a key driver of value. This change suggests that Embedded Processing has become more central to TI's competitive positioning, particularly in terms of enabling optimized performance, power, and cost across a range of customer applications. The elevation to a reportable segment also implies greater operational and financial focus, aligning with the company\u2019s long-term objective of strengthening its competitive advantages and driving free cash flow growth.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2022, Embedded Processing was described as part of TI's broader product portfolio and was integrated within the company\u2019s four competitive advantages without separate segment reporting.",
        "In 2024, Embedded Processing was explicitly elevated to a reportable segment, with a dedicated description emphasizing its role as the 'brains' of electronic equipment and its optimization for performance, power, and cost.",
        "The change indicates a strategic evolution where Embedded Processing has gained prominence in TI\u2019s business model, likely reflecting increased market demand or internal growth, and now plays a more distinct and emphasized role in the company's competitive positioning."

Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\n\n## Overview\n\nWe design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. Technology is the foundation of our company, but ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate long-term value for owners is the growth of free cash flow per share.\n\nOur strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth has three elements:\n\n1. A great business model that is focused on analog and embedded processing products and built around four sustainable competitive advantages. The four sustainable competitive advantages are powerful in combination and provide tangible benefits:\n- i. A strong foundation of manufacturing and technology that provides lower costs and greater control of our supply chain.\n- ii. A broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products that offers more opportunity per customer and more value for our investments.\n- iii. The reach of our market channels that gives access to more customers and more of their design projects, leading to the opportunity to sell more of our products into each design and gives us better insight and knowledge of customer needs.\n- iv. Diversity and longevity of our products, markets and customer positions that provide less single point dependency and longer returns on our investments.\n\nTogether, these competitive advantages help position TI in a unique class of companies capable of generating and returning significant amounts of cash for our owners. We make our investments with an eye towards longterm strengthening and leveraging of these advantages.\n\n2. Discipline in allocating capital to the best opportunities. This spans how we select R&amp;D projects, develop new capabilities like TI.com, invest in new manufacturing capacity or how we think about acquisitions and returning cash to our owners.\n3. Efficiency, which means constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent.\n\nWe believe that our business model with the combined effect of our four competitive advantages sets TI apart from our peers and will for a long time to come. We will invest to strengthen our competitive advantages, be disciplined in capital allocation and stay diligent in our pursuit of efficiencies. Finally, we will remain focused on the belief that long-term growth of free cash flow per share is the ultimate measure to generate value.\n\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&amp;A) should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. In the following discussion of our results of operations:\n\n- Our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels, and how management allocates resources and measures results. See Note 1 to the financial statements for more information regarding our segments.\n- When we discuss our results:\n- Unless otherwise noted, changes in our revenue are attributable to changes in customer demand, which are evidenced by fluctuations in shipment volumes.\n- New products do not tend to have a significant impact on our revenue in any given period because we sell such a large number of products.\n- From time to time, our revenue and gross profit are affected by changes in demand for higher-priced or lower-priced products, which we refer to as changes in the 'mix' of products shipped.",

Description of business, including segment and geographic area information\n\nWe design and manufacture semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all ov er the world. We hav e two reportable segments, Analog and Embedded Processing, each of which represents groups of products that hav e similar design and dev elopment requirements, product characteristics and manufacturing processes. Our segments reflect how our chief operating decision maker (CODM), which is our chief executiv e officer, allocates resources and measures results.\n\n- Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often conv erting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by conv erting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. Our Analog segment consists of two major product lines: Power and Signal Chain.\n- Embedded Processing products are the digital 'brains' of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for v arious combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application.\n\nWe report the results of our remaining business activ ities in Other. Other includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitativ e thresholds for indiv idually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other includes DLP  products, calculators and custom ASIC products. \u00ae\n\nIn Other, we also include items that are not used in ev aluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. Examples of these items include acquisition, integration and restructuring charges (see Note 11); and certain corporate-lev el items, such as litigation expenses, env ironmental costs, insurance settlements, and gains and losses from other activ ities, including asset dispositions. We allocate the remainder of our expenses associated with corporate activ ities to our operating segments based on specific methodologies, such as percentage of operating expenses or headcount.\n\nOur centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, prov ide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments' results and, therefore, is not prov ided.\n\nWith the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, nor does the CODM ev aluate operating segments using discrete asset information. We hav e no material intersegment rev enue. The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in the significant accounting policies and practices.\n\nThe CODM assesses the performance of our segments and decides how to allocate resources based on each segment's rev enue growth, gross margin and operating profit. The CODM utilizes these metrics by comparing budget v ersus actual results as well as benchmarking to our competitors.\n\n## Segment information\n\n",
