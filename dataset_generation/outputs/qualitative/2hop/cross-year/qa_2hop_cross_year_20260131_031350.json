      "question": "How has Linde plc's non-employee director restricted stock unit award program evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of governance structure and long-term shareholder alignment mechanisms?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Linde plc introduced the Non-Employee Director Restricted Stock Unit Award under the 2021 Linde plc Long Term Incentive Plan, establishing a framework for equity-based compensation tied to long-term performance metrics. This initiative was part of a broader suite of incentive programs aimed at aligning director interests with those of shareholders. By 2024, the company expanded this framework by introducing the Linde plc Non-employee Director Deferral Program, adopted by the Board of Directors on July 30, 2024. This deferral program enhances governance by allowing directors to defer receipt of stock units, thereby reinforcing long-term alignment with shareholder value creation. The evolution from a basic restricted stock unit award to a more sophisticated deferral mechanism indicates Linde\u2019s strategic emphasis on strengthening board accountability and promoting sustained corporate governance standards.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, the Non-Employee Director Restricted Stock Unit Award was introduced under the 2021 Long Term Incentive Plan, signaling the start of structured equity compensation for directors.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the Non-employee Director Deferral Program was adopted, allowing directors to defer stock unit payouts and thereby increasing their long-term stake in the company.",
        "Step 3: The addition of the deferral mechanism demonstrates an evolution in governance strategy, moving beyond initial equity alignment to encourage directors to maintain a sustained financial interest in the company\u2019s long-term performance."

      "question": "How has Linde's relationship with helium evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of its impact on sales and operating profit?",
      "answer": "In 2022, helium was listed as a supply for Linde, indicating a positive or neutral relationship. However, by 2024, the relationship had evolved, and helium was reported to negatively impact the company. Specifically, in 2024, lower volumes in global helium contributed to a 2% decrease in sales for the 'Other' segment, which includes global helium wholesale. Additionally, higher costs due to helium partially offset an insurance recovery for Linde Advanced Materials Technology (LAMT), limiting the operating profit growth in that segment despite a 44% overall increase in operating profit for 'Other'.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, helium was categorized as a supply, suggesting it was a neutral or beneficial input for Linde\u2019s operations.",
        "Step 2: By 2024, helium was explicitly linked to negative financial impacts, including a 2% drop in sales and increased costs.",
        "Step 3: The change from a supply relationship to a negatively impacting factor indicates a transformation in how helium affects Linde\u2019s business performance over time."

Underlying sales decreased 2% in 2024 versus 2023 primarily due to lower volumes in global helium and LAMT. The impact of currency translation was flat in 2024 versus 2023.\n\n## Operating profit\n\nOperating profit in Other increased $19 million, or 44%, in 2024 versus 2023. The increase was driven by insurance recovery for LAMT partially offset by higher costs due to helium.\n\n## Currency\n\nThe results of Linde's non-U.S. operations are translated to the company's reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, from the functional currencies used in the countries in which the company operates. For most foreign operations, Linde uses the local currency as its functional currency.

      "question": "How did Linde plc's structure of Performance Share Unit Awards evolve between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of the performance metrics used for grants beginning in 2019?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Linde plc disclosed two forms of Performance Share Unit Awards under the Amended and Restated 2009 Praxair, Inc. Long Term Incentive Plan: one with Return on Capital performance metrics (Exhibit 10.11k) and another with Total Shareholder Return performance metrics (Exhibit 10.11l). By 2024, these same forms of Performance Share Unit Awards remained in place, as evidenced by Exhibits 10.10l and 10.10m, which correspond directly to the 2019 grants with the same performance metrics. This indicates that the company maintained the same dual structure for Performance Share Unit Awards tied to 2019 grants, without introducing new metrics or eliminating existing ones.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Linde plc disclosed two types of Performance Share Unit Awards with specific performance metrics: Return on Capital (Exhibit 10.11k) and Total Shareholder Return (Exhibit 10.11l).",

      "answer": "In 2022, helium was a supply input for Linde, indicating a supportive role in operations. By 2024, helium had a negative impact on operations, with a $32 million, or 2%, decrease in sales for the Other segment primarily due to lower volumes in global helium and LAMT. Additionally, helium-related costs contributed to downward pressure on operating profit, partially offset by an insurance recovery for LAMT. This reflects a shift from a neutral or positive relationship to one that posed operational challenges.",

      "answer": "In 2023, helium was explicitly listed as one of Linde's primary products within its industrial gases business, specifically called out alongside gases like oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen. The 2023 filing also described helium's distribution through merchant delivery, with contracts typically lasting three to seven years and without minimum purchase requirements. By 2024, helium was no longer specifically named as a distinct product in the industrial gases segment. Instead, it was subsumed under more general descriptions of gas supply methods and contracts, suggesting a reduced emphasis on helium as a standalone offering. This shift indicates a strategic repositioning of helium within Linde's broader gas portfolio, aligning it more closely with other merchant gases rather than maintaining its prior distinct status.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Linde described green hydrogen as being produced primarily through electrolysis using renewable energy or from steam methane reforming of biomethane, and it was presented as one of the company's clean energy offerings alongside blue hydrogen. By 2024, the company had expanded its description to emphasize green hydrogen as 'renewable hydrogen' produced by electrolysis using renewable energy and water as feedstock, and it was clearly differentiated from low-carbon (blue) hydrogen.

BUSINE SS\n\n## General\n\nLinde plc is a public limited company formed under the laws of Ireland with its principal offices in the United Kingdom and United States. Linde is the largest industrial gas company worldwide and is a major technological innovator in the industrial gases industry. Its primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, and rare gases) and process gases (hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, electronic gases, specialty gases, and acetylene, etc.). The company also designs and builds equipment that produces industrial gases and offers customers a wide range of gas production and processing services such as olefin plants, natural gas plants, air separation plants, hydrogen and synthesis gas plants and other types of plants.\n\nLinde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, chemicals and energy, manufacturing, metals and mining, food and beverage, and electronics.\n\nLinde's sales were $33,005 million, $32,854 million, and $33,364 million for 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Refer to Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis, for a discussion of consolidated sales and Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to Linde's reportable segments.\n\n## Industrial Gases Products and Manufacturing Processes\n\nAtmospheric gases are the highest volume products produced by Linde. Using ambient air as feedstock, Linde produces oxygen, nitrogen and argon through several air separation processes of which cryogenic air separation is the most prevalent. Linde is the market leader in the field of non-cryogenic air separation technologies for the production of industrial gases. As part of this process Linde also produces rare gases, such as krypton, neon, and xenon. As a pioneer and leader in industrial gases, Linde is continuously developing a wide range of proprietary and patented applications and technologies to produce, store, distribute and increase usage of its gases. These technologies open important new markets and provide customers with opportunities to reduce costs, by increasing their operational efficiencies, including vacuum pressure swing adsorption ('VPSA') and membrane separation technology to produce gaseous oxygen and nitrogen on-site.\n\nProcess gases, including hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, specialty gases and acetylene are produced by other production methods.\n\nHydrogen is produced from a range of different feedstocks using a wide portfolio of technologies. Today, carbon intensity is used to designate and differentiate between the production processes and the respective feedstocks used to produce the molecule. The majority of conventional hydrogen currently produced by Linde is derived from natural gas or methane, using steam methane reformation (SMR) or auto-thermal reforming (ATR) technology. Linde has a range of technologies to produce low-carbon hydrogen from fossil feedstocks, or renewable hydrogen from renewable energy (non-fossil feedstock). Both products are considered sources of clean energy. Low-carbon (blue) hydrogen is produced primarily from methane, by capturing carbon emissions from a hydrogen production plant and sequestering them subsurface for the long term. Renewable (green) hydrogen is produced by electrolysis using renewable energy and water as feedstock. Other sources of lowcarbon hydrogen are existing chemical and petrochemical processes, out of which Linde recovers hydrogen for subsequent treatment and cleaning to achieve ultrahigh purity levels.\n\nCarbon monoxide can be produced by either steam methane reforming (SMR) or auto-thermal reforming (ATR) of natural gas or other feedstock such as naphtha, a by-product  in  the  petrochemical  industry.  Most  carbon  diox ide  comes  as  an  industrial  by-product,  that  is  sourced  from  chemical  plants,  refineries  and  other processes or is recovered from natural carbon dioxide sources. Raw carbon dioxide is processed and purified in Linde's plants to produce commercial and food-grade carbon dioxide. Helium is sourced from certain helium-rich natural gas streams in the United States, with additional supplies being acquired from outside the United States. Acetylene is primarily sourced as a chemical by-product, but may also be produced from calcium carbide and water.\n\n## Industrial Gases Distribution\n\nThere are three basic distribution  methods  for  industrial  gases:  (i)  on-site  or  tonnage;  (ii)  merchant  or  bulk  liquid;  and  (iii)  packaged  or  cylinder  gases.  These distribution methods are often integrated, with products from all three supply modes coming from the same plant. The method of supply is generally determined by the lowest cost means of meeting the customer's needs, depending upon factors such as volume requirements, purity, pattern of usage, and the form in which the product is used (as a gas or as a cryogenic liquid).\n\n## Linde plc and Subsidiaries\n\n## PART I",
