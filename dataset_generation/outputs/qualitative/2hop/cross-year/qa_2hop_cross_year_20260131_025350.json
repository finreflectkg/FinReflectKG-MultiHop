      "question": "How has the role of Google Marketing Platform in the company's advertising revenue generation evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in relation to how advertising revenues are recognized and managed across Google Network properties?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Google Marketing Platform was directly involved in the recognition of advertising revenues on a gross basis for Google Network properties, meaning the full amount billed to customers was recorded as revenue. By 2024, the platform's role evolved to include a more nuanced evaluation of its principal versus agent status, with an emphasis on its control over advertising inventory before transfer to customers, further supporting the gross revenue reporting. Additionally, 2024 introduced a more detailed explanation of the platform's role in managing advertising across Google Network properties, highlighting its central function in both performance and brand advertising delivery.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2023, Google Marketing Platform was used by customers to purchase advertising inventory and revenues from Google Network properties were generally reported on a gross basis.",
        "In 2024, the platform's role in advertising delivery was elaborated upon, with a focus on its status as principal, control over advertising inventory, and discretion in pricing, which supports gross revenue reporting.",
        "The evolution from a transactional tool in 2023 to a more strategically embedded platform in 2024 indicates a transformation in its role within the advertising revenue ecosystem."

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Nature of Operations\n\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\n\nWe generate revenues by deliv ering relev ant, cost-effectiv e online adv ertising; cloud-based solutions that prov ide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure, platform serv ices, and applications; sales of other products and serv ices, such as fees receiv ed for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and dev ices.\n\n## Basis of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the v ariable interest and v oting models. Intercompany balances and transactions hav e been eliminated.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported  and  disclosed  in  the  financial  statements  and  the  accompanying  notes. Actual  results  could  differ  materially  from  these  estimates  due  to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we ev aluate our estimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; contingent liabilities; fair v alues of financial instruments and goodwill; income taxes; inv entory; and useful liv es of property and equipment, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believ ed to be reasonable, and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying v alues of assets and liabilities.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or serv ices is transferred to our customers, and the collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or serv ices is probable. Sales and other similar taxes are excluded from rev enues.\n\n## Advertising Revenues\n\nWe generate advertising rev enues primarily by deliv ering adv ertising on:\n\n- Google  Search  and  other  properties,  including  rev enues  from  traffic  generated  by  search  distribution  partners  who  use  Google.com  as  their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n- YouTube properties; and\n- Google Network properties, including rev enues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\n\nOur  customers  generally  purchase  adv ertising  inv entory  through  Google Ads,  Google Ad  Manager,  Google  Display  &amp;  Video  360,  and  Google Marketing Platform, among others.\n\nWe offer adv ertising by deliv ering both performance and brand adv ertising. We recognize rev enues for performance adv ertising when a user engages with the adv ertisement. For brand adv ertising, we recognize rev enues when the ad is displayed, or a user v iews the ad.\n\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we ev aluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report rev enues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report rev enues on a net basis). Generally, we report adv ertising rev enues for ads placed on Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as rev enues, and amounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of rev enues. Where we are the principal,  we  control  the  adv ertising  inv entory  before  it  is  transferred  to  our  customers.  Our  control  is  ev idenced  by  our  sole  ability  to  monetize  the advertising inv entory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers and hav ing a lev el of discretion in establishing pricing.\n\n## Google Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices\n\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and dev ices rev enues consist of rev enues from:",

T oday, all sev en of our two billion-user products - Android, Chrome, Gmail, Maps, Play Store, Search, and YouTube - are using Gemini.\n\nOur Google Cloud products, including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, help organizations stay at the forefront of innov ation with our AI-optimized infrastructure, AI dev elopment platform, world-class models, as well as assistiv e agents and applications.\n\nWe believe AI  has  the  potential  to  solv e  important  societal,  scientific,  and  engineering  challenges.  For  example,  in  2020,  Google  DeepMind's AlphaFold system solved a 50-year-old protein folding challenge, and in 2024, we introduced AlphaFold 3, built on the prev ious models, to predict the structure and interactions of all the molecules in life's processes.\n\nWe are focused on transforming our products to prov ide the most helpful tools to our users and customers as we deliv er on our mission to organize the world's information and make it univ ersally accessible and useful.\n\n## Deliver the Most Advanced, Safe, and Responsible AI\n\nWe aim to build the most advanced, safe, and responsible AI through a full stack of robust AI-optimized infrastructure, including data centers, chips, and a global fiber network; world class research teams; and a broad global reach through products and platforms that touch billions of people and customers around the world.\n\nWe are driv ing efficiencies in our data centers, while making significant hardware and model improv ements. For example, since we started serv ing AI Overv iews to our users, we hav e significantly lowered machine costs and latency through hardware, engineering, and technical breakthroughs. Our AIoptimized infrastructure allows us to use, and offer our customers, a range of AI accelerator options, including our own custom-built T ensor Processing Units (TPUs).\n\nOur teams across Alphabet lev erage Gemini, as well as other AI models we hav e prev iously dev eloped and announced, to deliv er the best product and serv ice experiences for our users, adv ertisers, partners, customers, and dev elopers. We are using Gemini 2.0 in new research prototypes, including Project Astra,  which  explores  the  future  capabilities  of  a  univ ersal AI  assistant  and  Project  Mariner ,  an  early  prototype  capable  of  taking  actions  in Chrome as an experimental extension.\n\nWe believe our approach to AI must be both bold and responsible. That means dev eloping AI in a way that maximizes the positiv e benefits to society while addressing its potential challenges, guided by our AI Principles.\n\n## Enable Organizations and Developers to Innovate on Google Cloud\n\nAI is a major technology shift for enterprises. Globally, businesses from startups to large enterprises, and the public sector are thinking about how to  driv e  transformation.  T hat  is  why  we  are  focused  on  making  it  easy  and  scalable  for  others  to  innov ate,  and  grow ,  with AI.  T hat  means  prov iding advanced computing infrastructure and expanding access to Google's latest AI models. Our Vertex AI platform giv es dev elopers the ability to train, tune, augment, test, and deploy applications using Gemini, Imagen, Veo, and other generativ e AI models. Gemini for Google Cloud prov ides pre-packaged AI agents that can assist dev elopers to write, document, test, and operate software as well as assist cybersecurity teams to analyze, detect, protect, and respond to threats.\n\n## Improve Knowledge, Learning, Creativity, and Productivity\n\nAs AI continues to improv e rapidly, we are focused on transforming our products to prov ide our users the most helpful tools. Examples include AI Overviews, which allow users to ask their most complex questions, break down concepts in a format that is useful for them, or take a v ideo and ask a question out loud, and NotebookLM, which helps users understand complex information by summarizing sources and prov iding relev ant quotes. We are embedding the power of generativ e AI to continue helping our users express themselv es and get things done. For example, the Gemini app allows users to collaborate with new AI features that include image generation capabilities, coding support, and app integration. Gemini for Google Workspace helps users write,  organize,  v isualize,  accelerate  workflows,  and  hav e  richer  meetings. Additionally,  we  are  using  Gemini  to  improv e  recommendations  on YouTube. We also know businesses of all sizes around the world rely on Google Ads to find customers and grow their businesses - and we",

      "question": "How has the role of Google Network partners in Google's advertising revenue model evolved between 2023 and 2024, based on changes in the way payments to these partners are described?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Google Network partners were described as part of the primary uses of cash from operating activities, specifically noting payments made to these partners as a standard operating expense. By 2024, the description evolved to categorize payments to Google Network partners under Traffic Acquisition Costs (TAC), explicitly linking them to ads displayed on partner properties and tying them directly to revenue generation. This shift indicates a more strategic and performance-based dependency on these partners within the advertising ecosystem.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2023, payments to Google Network partners were listed among other operating expense outflows like employee compensation and content provider payments, indicating a general cost of operations.",
        "In 2024, the payments to Google Network partners were specifically classified under TAC, directly tied to ad placements on partner properties, signaling a more strategic and revenue-linked role.",
        "The reclassification from a general operating expense to a performance-linked cost reflects an evolution in how Google views and utilizes its relationship with Network partners, emphasizing their integral role in ad revenue generation."

We report rev enues from Google Play sales of apps and in-app purchases on a net basis because our performance obligation is to facilitate a transaction between app dev elopers and end users for which we earn a serv ice fee.\n\n## Google Cloud Revenues\n\nGoogle Cloud rev enues consist of rev enues from:\n\n- Google  Cloud  Platform,  which  generates  consumption-based  fees  and  subscriptions  for  infrastructure,  platform,  and  other  serv ices.  T hese serv ices  prov ide  access  to  solutions  such  as AI  offerings  including  our AI  infrastructure,  Vertex AI  platform,  and  Gemini  for  Google  Cloud; cybersecurity; and data and analytics;\n- Google  Workspace, which includes subscriptions  for  cloud-based  communication  and  collaboration  tools  for  enterprises,  such  as  Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Driv e, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for Google Workspace; and\n- other enterprise serv ices.\n\nOur cloud serv ices are generally prov ided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may hav e contract terms longer than a year. Rev enues related to cloud serv ices prov ided on a consumption basis are recognized when the customer utilizes the serv ices, based on the quantity of serv ices consumed. Revenues related to cloud serv ices prov ided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably ov er the contract term as the customer receiv es and consumes the benefits of the cloud serv ices.\n\n## Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\n\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate rev enues to each performance obligation based on its relativ e standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers.\n\n## Customer Incentives and Credits\n\nCertain customers receiv e cash-based incentiv es or credits, which are accounted for as v ariable consideration. We estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce rev enues. We believ e that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration related to customer incentiv es and credits.\n\n## Sales Commissions\n\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred when the period of the expected benefit is one year or less. We recognize an asset for certain sales commissions and amortize if the expected benefit period is greater than one year. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.\n\n## Cost of Revenues\n\nCost of rev enues consists of TAC and other costs of rev enues.\n\n- TAC includes:\n- amounts paid to our distribution partners who make av ailable our search access points and serv ices. Our distribution partners include browser prov iders, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software dev elopers; and\n- amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n- Other cost of rev enues includes:\n- content  acquisition  costs,  which  are  payments  to  content  prov iders  from  whom  we  license  v ideo  and  other  content  for  distribution, primarily related to YouTube (we pay fees to these content prov iders based on rev enues generated, subscriber counts, or a flat fee);\n- depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure;",

Working with content creators and partners, we continue to build new ways for people around the world to create and find great digital content.\n\nFueling all of these great digital experiences are extraordinary platforms and dev ices. T hat is why we continue to inv est in platforms like our Android mobile operating system, Chrome browser, and Chrome operating system, as well as our family of dev ices. We see tremendous potential for dev ices to be helpful and make people's liv es easier by combining the best of our AI, software, and hardware. This potential is reflected in our latest generation of devices, such as the new Pixel 9 series and the Pixel Watch 3. Creating products and serv ices that people rely on ev ery day is a journey that we are inv esting in for the long-term.\n\n## How We Make Money\n\nWe  have  built  world-class  adv ertising  technologies  for  adv ertisers,  agencies,  and  publishers  to  power  their  digital  marketing  businesses.  Our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses through our wide range of products across dev ices and formats, and we aim to ensure positiv e user experiences by serv ing the right ads at the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies. AI has been foundational to our adv ertising business for more than a decade. Products like Demand Gen, Performance Max, and Product Studio use the full power of our AI to help adv ertisers find untapped and incremental conv ersion opportunities.\n\nGoogle  Serv ices  generates  rev enues  primarily  by  deliv ering  both  performance  and  brand  adv ertising  that  appears  on  Google  Search  &amp;  other properties,  YouT ube,  and  Google  Network  partners'  properties  (\"Google  Network  properties\").  We  continue  to  inv est  in  both  performance  and  brand advertising and seek to improv e the measurability of adv ertising so adv ertisers understand the effectiv eness of their campaigns.\n\n- Performance advertising creates and deliv ers relev ant ads that users will click on leading to direct engagement with adv ertisers. Performance advertising lets our adv ertisers connect with users while driv ing measurable results. Our ads tools allow performance adv ertisers to create simple text-based ads.\n- Brand advertising helps  enhance  users'  awareness of  and  affinity  for  adv ertisers'  products  and  serv ices,  through  v ideos,  text,  images,  and other  interactiv e  ads  that  run  across  v arious  dev ices.  We  help  brand  adv ertisers  deliv er  digital  v ideos  and  other  types  of  ads  to  specific audiences for their brand-building marketing campaigns.\n\nWe have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad adv ertising practices and protecting users on the web. We focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and adv ertisers in many ways, including filtering out inv alid traffic, remov ing billions of bad ads from our systems every year, and closely monitoring the sites, apps, and v ideos where ads appear and blocklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content.\n\nIn addition, Google Serv ices increasingly generates rev enues from products and serv ices beyond adv ertising, including:\n\n- consumer subscriptions, which primarily include rev enues from YouTube serv ices, such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;\n- platforms , which primarily include rev enues from Google Play sales of apps and in-app purchases; and\n- devices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of dev ices.\n\n## Google Cloud\n\nThrough our Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace offerings, Google Cloud generates rev enues primarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, applications, and other cloud serv ices. Customers use Google Cloud in multiple ways such as:\n\n- AI-optimized Infrastructure: prov ides  open,  reliable,  and  scalable  compute,  networking, and storage to enable customers to run workloads anywhere - on our Cloud, at the edge, or in their data centers. It can be used to migrate and modernize IT systems and to train and serv e various types of AI models.\n- Developer Platform: prov ides dev elopers, through the Vertex AI platform, the ability to train, tune, augment, test, and deploy applications using Gemini and other leading generativ e AI models. We offer widely used first-party, third-party, and open models along with serv ices such as v ector search, grounding, and distillation to further improv e the cost and quality of models.\n- Cybersecurity: prov ides  AI  powered  cybersecurity  solutions  to  help  customers  analyze,  detect,  protect,  and  respond  to  a  broad  range  of cybersecurity  threats,  to  further  strengthen  security  outcomes,  prioritize  which  threats  to  inv estigate,  and  identify  attack  paths,  as  well  as accelerate resolution of cybersecurity threats.",

      "question": "How has the role of Google Ad Manager in Alphabet's advertising revenue recognition strategy evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of its integration with revenue reporting models?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Google Ad Manager was directly tied to Alphabet's advertising revenue recognition on a gross basis, with the company reporting the full amount billed to customers as revenue for ads placed on Google Network properties. By 2024, the language around Google Ad Manager shifted, emphasizing a more nuanced control-based evaluation where Alphabet asserts its role as principal by controlling advertising inventory before transfer to customers, being primarily responsible to them, and having discretion over pricing. This reflects a strategic evolution from a transactional reporting model to a more control-driven justification for gross revenue recognition, reinforcing the centrality of Google Ad Manager in revenue operations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2023, Alphabet reported advertising revenues from Google Network properties using platforms like Google Ad Manager, with revenues generally recorded on a gross basis based on amounts billed to customers.",
        "In 2024, Alphabet introduced a more detailed rationale for gross revenue reporting, emphasizing control over advertising inventory before transfer, primary responsibility to customers, and pricing discretion\u2014factors directly tied to Google Ad Manager\u2019s role.",
        "The evolution indicates a shift from simply using Google Ad Manager as a platform for revenue generation (2023) to positioning it as a central mechanism for asserting control and therefore justifying gross revenue reporting (2024), reflecting a deeper strategic integration."

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Nature of Operations\n\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\n\nWe generate revenues by deliv ering relev ant, cost-effectiv e online adv ertising; cloud-based solutions that prov ide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure, platform serv ices, and applications; sales of other products and serv ices, such as fees receiv ed for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and dev ices.\n\n## Basis of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the v ariable interest and v oting models. Intercompany balances and transactions hav e been eliminated.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported  and  disclosed  in  the  financial  statements  and  the  accompanying  notes. Actual  results  could  differ  materially  from  these  estimates  due  to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we ev aluate our estimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; contingent liabilities; fair v alues of financial instruments and goodwill; income taxes; inv entory; and useful liv es of property and equipment, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believ ed to be reasonable, and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying v alues of assets and liabilities.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or serv ices is transferred to our customers, and the collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or serv ices is probable. Sales and other similar taxes are excluded from rev enues.\n\n## Advertising Revenues\n\nWe generate advertising rev enues primarily by deliv ering adv ertising on:\n\n- Google  Search  and  other  properties,  including  rev enues  from  traffic  generated  by  search  distribution  partners  who  use  Google.com  as  their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n- YouTube properties; and\n- Google Network properties, including rev enues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\n\nOur  customers  generally  purchase  adv ertising  inv entory  through  Google Ads,  Google Ad  Manager,  Google  Display  &amp;  Video  360,  and  Google Marketing Platform, among others.\n\nWe offer adv ertising by deliv ering both performance and brand adv ertising. We recognize rev enues for performance adv ertising when a user engages with the adv ertisement. For brand adv ertising, we recognize rev enues when the ad is displayed, or a user v iews the ad.\n\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we ev aluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report rev enues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report rev enues on a net basis). Generally, we report adv ertising rev enues for ads placed on Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as rev enues, and amounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of rev enues. Where we are the principal,  we  control  the  adv ertising  inv entory  before  it  is  transferred  to  our  customers.  Our  control  is  ev idenced  by  our  sole  ability  to  monetize  the advertising inv entory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers and hav ing a lev el of discretion in establishing pricing.\n\n## Google Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices\n\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and dev ices rev enues consist of rev enues from:",

      "question": "How did Meta's disclosure regarding user perception as a risk factor evolve between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of the nature of risks highlighted and their potential impact on business operations?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Meta emphasized user perception risks related to privacy, safety, content quality, and regulatory changes, specifically noting concerns around decreased user sentiment and engagement due to data practices and content policies. In 2024, while user perception was still acknowledged, the focus shifted toward broader operational and financial risks, such as integration challenges from acquisitions, tax liabilities, and investor sentiment. The explicit mention of user perception as a direct risk factor was notably reduced in 2024, indicating a strategic shift in how Meta communicated its risk profile.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, Meta listed multiple user perception-related risks, including decreased user sentiment due to privacy concerns, content quality, and regulatory changes like GDPR and DSA.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the risk disclosures centered more on financial and operational concerns such as acquisition integration, tax liabilities, and investor perception, with less emphasis on user sentiment.",
        "Step 3: The change indicates a transformation in how Meta framed its risk factors, moving from a user-centric risk narrative to a more financially and structurally oriented one."

The incurrence of indebtedness also results in increased fixed obligations and increased interest expense, and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. We may also issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions and we regularly grant restricted stock units to retain the employees of acquired companies, which could increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial results, and result in dilution to our stockholders. In addition, any acquisitions or other strategic transactions we announce could be viewed negatively by users, marketers, developers, or investors, which may adversely affect our business or the price of our Class A common stock.\n\nWe may also discover liabilities, deficiencies, or other claims associated with the companies or assets we acquire that were not identified in advance, which may result in significant unanticipated costs. The effectiveness of our due diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their representatives, as well as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed. In addition, we may fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition or other strategic transaction, including tax and accounting charges. Acquisitions or other strategic transactions may also result in our recording of significant additional expenses to our results of operations and recording of substantial finite-lived intangible assets on our balance sheet upon closing. Any of these factors may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\n\n## We may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions, and we incur significant costs to integrate and support the companies we acquire.\n\nThe integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources, particularly with respect to companies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience, and we may not manage these processes successfully. We have made, and may in the future make, substantial investments of resources to support our acquisitions, which can result in significant ongoing operating expenses and the diversion of resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We cannot assure you that these investments will be successful. If we fail to successfully integrate the companies we acquire, we may not realize the benefits ex pected from the transaction and our business may be harmed.\n\n## We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\n\nOur tax obligations, including income and non-income taxes, are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements, including the  manner  in  which  we  operate  our  business,  develop,  value,  manage,  protect,  and  use  our  intellectual  property,  and  the  valuations  of  our  intercompany transactions.  The  tax   laws  applicable  to  our  business,  including  the  laws  of  the  United  States  and  other  jurisdictions,  are  subject  to  interpretation  and  certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax  revenue from companies such as Meta. We are subject to regular review and audit by U.S. federal, state, and foreign tax  authorities. Tax  authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, including our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For example, in 2016 and 2018, the IRS issued formal assessments relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 through 2013 tax years. Although we disagree with the IRS's position and are litigating this issue, the ultimate resolution is uncertain and, if resolved in a manner unfavorable to us, may adversely affect our financial results.\n\nThe determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our provision for income taxes is determined by the manner in which we operate our business, and any changes to such operations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate. Although we believe that our provision for income taxes and estimates of our non-income tax liabilities are reasonable, the ultimate settlement may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.",

      "question": "How has Meta's compliance approach to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in response to regulatory actions and decisions?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Meta was in the process of implementing steps to comply with corrective orders from the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) following a EUR \u20ac1.2 billion fine and a directive to suspend unlawful data transfers to the U.S. under Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs). At that time, the EU-U.S. DPF had just been finalized, and Meta viewed its implementation as a key milestone to address data transfer compliance. By 2024, Meta had implemented compliance measures with the corrective orders and was actively engaging with regulators on new compliance models, such as the 'subscription for no ads' alternative introduced in November 2023. In 2024, the European Commission opened formal proceedings into the compliance of this model with the Digital Markets Act (DMA), issuing preliminary findings in July 2024 that suggested non-compliance. This reflects a shift from foundational compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF framework to navigating more complex regulatory scrutiny around specific business models under evolving EU laws.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, Meta faced a EUR \u20ac1.2 billion fine and corrective orders from the IDPC, prompting implementation of compliance steps with the newly established EU-U.S. DPF.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, Meta had already implemented compliance measures and introduced new product-level controls, such as the 'subscription for no ads' model, which became the subject of new regulatory investigations under the DMA.",
        "Step 3: The evolution from foundational compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF in 2023 to active regulatory scrutiny of Meta\u2019s specific business practices in 2024 indicates a shift in the nature of Meta\u2019s engagement with EU data regulations, moving from structural compliance to operational enforcement challenges."

Separately, on March 25, 2022, the European Union and United States announced that they had reached an agreement in principle on a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF). On October 7, 2022, President Biden signed the Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities (E.O.), and on June 30, 2023, the European Union and the three additional countries making up the EEA were designated by the United States Attorney G eneral as a \"qualifying state\" under Section 3(f) of the E.O. On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision in relation to the United States. The adequacy decision concludes that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the European Union to organizations in the United States that are included in the \"Data Privacy Framework List,\" maintained and made publicly available by the United States Department of Commerce pursuant to the EUU.S. DPF. The implementation of the EU-U.S. DPF and the adequacy decision are important and welcome milestones, and we have implemented steps to comply with the above corrective orders following engagement with the IDPC. The EU-U.S. DPF replaces two prior adequacy frameworks which were invalidated by the CJEU. A further invalidation of the EU-U.S. DPF by the CJEU could create considerable uncertainty and lead to us being unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nWe have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments, which together with proposed or new legislation and regulations could significantly affect our business in the future. For example, we have implemented a number of product changes and controls as a result of requirements under the GDPR, and may implement additional changes in the future. The GDPR also requires submission of personal data breach notifications to our lead European Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance with the notification obligation as well as other requirements of the regulation. The interpretation of the GDPR is still evolving, including through decisions of the CJEU, and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR's consistency mechanism, which may lead to significant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. We also face potential enforcement from European privacy regulators other than the IDPC, including where those regulators consider they must act urgently or where they believe their concerns relate only to data processing undertaken in their individual jurisdiction. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty, and as it evolves, could potentially have a negative impact on our business and/or our operations. In addition, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and other countries have enacted similar data protection regulations imposing data privacy-related requirements on products and services offered to users in their respective jurisdictions. The California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CCPA), also establishes certain transparency rules and creates certain data privacy rights for users, including limitations on our use of certain sensitive personal information and more ability for users to control the purposes for which their data is shared with third parties. Other states have proposed or enacted similar comprehensive privacy laws that afford users with similar data privacy rights and controls. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and resulting limitations on our advertising services, or reductions of advertising by marketers, have to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. Some states have also proposed or enacted laws specifically focused on the privacy rights and controls for users under 18 years old and their parents or guardians. Like comprehensive privacy laws, these laws are evolving and subject to interpretation, and may restrict our ability to offer certain products and services provided to all or certain cohorts of users in those states, adversely affecting our advertising business. In Europe, evolving interpretation of the ePrivacy  Directive's requirements regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies may lead to regulators imposing specific measures in the future which could directly impact our use of such technologies.  In addition, the ePrivacy  Directive and national implementation laws impose additional limitations on the use of data across messaging products and include significant penalties for non-compliance. Changes to our products or business practices as a result of these or similar developments have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our advertising business. For example, in response  to  regulatory  developments  in  Europe,  we  announced  plans  to  change  the  legal  basis  for  behavioral  advertising  on  Facebook  and  Instagram  in  the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and in November 2023 we began offering users in the region a \"subscription for no ads\" alternative. We are engaging with regulators on our consent model, including regarding compliance with requirements under the GDPR, Digital Markets Act (DMA), and EU consumer laws. For example, in March 2024, the European Commission opened formal proceedings regarding the compliance of our \"subscription for no ads\" model with requirements under the DMA, and it issued preliminary findings in July 2024, reflecting its preliminary view that our model does not comply with such requirements, and indicated that it will conclude its investigation in March 2025. In addition, the European Data Protection Board has published an opinion on the operation of such models under GDPR and European consumer protection organizations have raised concerns regarding our compliance with consumer protection laws. In response to these developments, in November 2024, we began offering users in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland who elect to continue using our services free-of-charge, supported by ads, an option to see less personalized ads,",

      "answer": "At the end of 2023, Meta had 'substantially completed' its facilities consolidation initiatives as part of the 2022 Restructuring, indicating the process was still ongoing. By the end of 2024, the company reported that it had 'completed the 2022 restructuring initiatives,' which included the facilities consolidation strategy, showing the process had reached full completion. Additionally, the 2024 disclosure included a financial summary of the 2022 Restructuring pre-tax charges across three years (2022\u20132024), indicating a retrospective quantification of the financial impact that was not explicitly detailed in 2023.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, Meta disclosed that the facilities consolidation initiatives were 'substantially completed' as of December 31, 2023, implying some aspects were still in progress.",

        "Step 3: The change from 'substantially completed' in 2023 to 'completed' in 2024 indicates the evolution of the strategy from near completion to full closure, with added financial transparency."

These measures included a facilities consolidation strategy to sublease, early terminate, or abandon several office buildings under operating leases, a layoff of approximately 11,000 employees across the Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL) segments, and a pivot towards a next generation data center design, including cancellation of multiple data center projects (the 2022 Restructuring). As of December 31, 2024, we have completed the 2022 restructuring initiatives.\n\nA summary of our 2022 Restructuring pre-tax charges for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, including subsequent adjustments, is as follows (in millions):\n\n",

      "question": "How has Verizon's approach to FWA Broadband evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of its positioning within the company's product portfolio and its target customer segments?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Verizon provided FWA broadband through both 5G and LTE networks, targeting both Consumer and Business customers, and reported 3.1 million FWA broadband connections. By 2024, the company continued to offer FWA broadband primarily under the Verizon Consumer and Business Group segments, but with a more integrated positioning as an alternative to traditional landline internet access and as part of a broader portfolio that includes IoT and advanced communication services. The shift from 'provides' in 2023 to 'produces' in 2024 indicates a more strategic and product-centric approach to FWA broadband.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, Verizon explicitly reported providing FWA broadband over 5G and LTE networks to both Consumer and Business customers, with a quantified 3.1 million FWA connections.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, FWA broadband is described as a produced product within both Consumer and Business segments, positioned as a key alternative to traditional landline internet and integrated with IoT and advanced services, though no updated numerical metric is provided.",
        "Step 3: The evolution reflects a shift from a network-based delivery focus to a more strategic product development and positioning approach, suggesting a maturation and expansion of FWA broadband within Verizon\u2019s offerings."

      "answer": "In 2023, Verizon permitted customers to acquire equipment using device payment plans that allowed installment payments over time, with no mention of structured promotional incentives or trade-in rights. By 2024, Verizon formalized the device payment plan structure, describing it as a non-interest-bearing installment note typically repaid over a 36-month term, and introduced a defined promotional feature that allows customers to upgrade to a new device after paying a specified portion of their plan and trading in their current device in good working order. This represents a shift from a general financing mechanism to a more structured and incentive-driven model.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, Verizon offered device payment plans that allowed customers to pay for equipment in installments over time, but no specific details were provided about promotional incentives or trade-in rights.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, Verizon detailed a more structured approach to device payment plans, specifying a 36-month repayment term and introduced a formal trade-in right as part of promotional offers, which impacts revenue recognition and customer upgrade pathways.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects an evolution from a basic financing tool to a more strategic, incentive-based product offering that influences both customer retention and equipment sales cycles."

For wireless service, we recognize revenue using an output method, either as the service allowance units are used or as time elapses, because it reflects the pattern by which we satisfy our performance obligation through the transfer of service to the customer. M onthly service is generally billed in advance, which results in a contract liability . See Note 2 for additional information. For postpaid plans, where monthly usage exceeds the allowance, the overage usage represents options held by the customer for incremental services and the usage-based fee is recognized when the customer exercises the option (typically on a month-to-month basis).\n\nFor our contracts related to wireline communication and connectivity services, in general, fixed monthly fees for service are billed one month in advance, which results in a contract liability , and serv ice rev enue is recogniz ed ov er the enforceable contract term as the service is rendered, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services through network access and usage. While substantially all of our wireline service revenue contracts are the result of providing access to our networks, revenue from services that are not fixed in amount and, instead, are based on usage are generally billed in arrears and recognized as the usage occurs.\n\n## Equipment\n\nWe sell wireless devices and accessories under the V erizon brand and other brands.  Equipment revenue is generally recognized when the products are delivered to and accepted by the customer, as this is when control passes to the customer. In addition to offering the sale of equipment on a standalone basis, we  have two primary offerings through which customers pay for a wireless device, in connection with a service contract: fixed-term plans (for our Business customers) and device payment plans.\n\nUnder a fixed-term plan, the customer is sold the wireless device without any upfront charge or at a discounted price in exchange for entering into a fixed-term service contract (typically  for a term of 36 months or less).\n\nUnder a device payment plan, the customer is sold the wireless device in exchange for a non-interest-bearing installment note, which is repaid by the customer, ty pically  ov er a 36-month term, and concurrently enters into a month-to-month contract for wireless service. We may offer certain promotions that provide billing credits applied over a specified term, contingent upon the customer maintaining service. The credits are included in the transaction price, which are allocated to the performance obligations based on their relative selling price and are recognized when earned.\n\nA financing component exists in both our fixed-term plans and device payment plans because the timing of the payment for the device, which occurs over the contract term, differs from the satisfaction of the performance obligation, which occurs at contract inception upon transfer of the device to the customer. We periodically assess, at the contract level, the significance of the financing component inherent in our fixed-term and device payment plan receivable based on qualitativ e and quantitativ e considerations related to our customer classes. These considerations include assessing the commercial objective of our plans, the term and duration of financing provided, interest rates prevailing in the marketplace, and credit risks of our customer classes, all of which impact our selection of appropriate discount rates. Based on current facts and circumstances, we determined that the financing component in our existing wireless device payments and fix ed-term contracts sold through the direct channel is not significant and therefore is not accounted for separately . See Note 8 for additional information on the interest on equipment financed on a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized agent in our indirect channel.\n\n## Wireless Contracts\n\nFor our wireless contracts, total contract revenue, which represents the transaction price for wireless service and wireless equipment, is allocated between service and equipment revenue based on their estimated standalone selling prices. We estimate the standalone selling price of the device or accessory to be its retail price excluding subsidies or conditional purchase discounts. We estimate the standalone selling price of wireless service to be the price that we offer to customers on month-to-month contracts that can be cancelled at any time without penalty (i.e., when there is no fixed-term for service) or when service is procured without the concurrent purchase of a wireless device. In addition, we also assess whether the service term is impacted by certain legally enforceable rights and obligations in our contract with customers, such as penalties that a customer would have to pay to early terminate a fixed-term contract or billing credits that would cease if the month-to-month wireless service is canceled. The assessment of these legally enforceable rights and obligations involves judgment and impacts our determination of the transaction price and related disclosures.\n\nFrom time to time, we may offer certain promotions that provide our customers on device payment plans with the right to upgrade to a new device after paying a specified portion of their device payment plan agreement amount and trading in their device in good working order. We account for this trade-in right as a guarantee obligation. The full amount of the trade-in right's fair value is recognized as a guarantee liability and results in a reduction to the revenue recognized upon the sale of the device. The total",

      "question": "How has Verizon's (VZ) treatment and valuation approach for international bonds evolved from 2023 to 2024 based on their 10-K disclosures?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Verizon described that international bonds were valued using matrix prices with input from independent third-party valuation sources as part of the broader fixed income securities category. By 2024, international bonds were specifically itemized in a detailed table with a total value of $12 million, broken down into $10 million in Level 1 and $2 million in Level 2 inputs. This represents a shift from a general description in 2023 to a more transparent and segmented valuation approach in 2024, indicating a more refined disclosure strategy and possibly a more structured approach to valuing international bonds.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, international bonds were described in a general category of fixed income securities and valued using matrix pricing with third-party inputs.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, international bonds were explicitly listed with a total value of $12 million, further categorized into Level 1 ($10 million) and Level 2 ($2 million) inputs.",
        "Step 3: The change from a general description in 2023 to a specific, itemized valuation in 2024 indicates a more detailed and transparent approach to valuing international bonds, reflecting an evolution in disclosure practices."

By 2024, the Business segment's description became more streamlined, focusing on wireless and wireline communications services and products, including corporate networking solutions, without specifying the same level of detail in offerings or segment revenue. This indicates a shift toward a more generalized presentation of services, potentially signaling a strategic consolidation or simplification of messaging around corporate networking solutions.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Verizon's 4G LTE network was positioned primarily as a foundational component of its wireless services, specifically highlighted as a means to provide FWA broadband as an alternative to traditional landline internet access. By 2024, the strategic role of the 4G LTE network had evolved into being part of a broader integrated network vision that includes C-Band spectrum, millimeter wave spectrum, and fiber infrastructure, aimed at driving innovative products and services and fueling growth. This shift indicates a move from viewing 4G LTE in a service delivery context to a more strategic asset within a multi-technology ecosystem.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, the 4G LTE network was described as a means to provide FWA broadband, serving as a key part of wireless services in the Consumer segment.",

The income (losses) at Atairos were driven by fair value adjustments on its underlying investments with income (loss) of $1.8 billion, $286 million and $(64) million 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net in 2021 primarily included gains related to nonmarketable equity securities and losses on certain marketable securities, compared to the prior year period which primarily included gains on nonmarketable securities.\n\n## Consolidated Income Tax (Expense) Benefit\n\nOur effective income tax rate in 2021 and 2020 was 27.5% and 23.9%, respectively.\n\nIn 2021, the effective income tax rate included $498 million of expense relating to the impact of tax law changes enacted in the United Kingdom in the second quarter of 2021, which, among other provisions, will increase the corporate tax rate to 25% from 19% effective April 1, 2023. The rate change resulted in an increase in our net deferred tax liabilities and a corresponding increase in income tax expense. Our income tax expense will reflect the new rate in the United Kingdom in 2023.\n\nIn 2020, the effective income tax rate included $145 million of expense relating to the impact of tax law changes in the third quarter of 2020.\n\n## Consolidated Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Subsidiary Preferred Stock\n\nThe  changes  in  net  income  (loss)  attributable  to  noncontrolling  interests  and  redeemable  subsidiary  preferred  stock  in  2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to losses at Universal Beijing Resort, which increased due to pre-opening costs prior to its opening in September 2021 (see Note 7).\n\n## Segment Operating Results\n\nOur  segment  operating  results  are  presented  based  on  how  we  assess  operating  performance  and  internally  report  financial information.

The amount of pre-tax gains (losses) related to net investment hedges recognized in the cumulative translation  adjustments  component  of  other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  were  gains  of  $760  million  in  2021,  losses  of  $686 million in 2020 and gains of $343 million in 2019.\n\n## Revolving Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs\n\nIn March 2021, we entered into a new $11 billion revolving credit facility due March 30, 2026 with a syndicate of banks that may be used for general corporate purposes. We may increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility up to a total of $14 billion, as well as extend the expiration date to no later than March 30, 2028, subject to approval of the lenders. The interest rate on the revolving credit facility consists of a base rate plus a borrowing margin that is determined based on Comcast's credit rating. As of  December  31,  2021,  the  borrowing  margin  for  borrowings  based  on  the  London  Interbank  Offered  Rate  was  1.00%.  Our revolving credit facility requires that we maintain certain financial ratios based on debt and EBITDA, as defined in the revolving credit  facility.  We  were  in  compliance  with  all  financial  covenants  for  all  periods  presented.  The  new  revolving  credit  facility replaced an aggregate $9.2 billion of existing revolving credit facilities due May 26, 2022, which were terminated.\n\nOur commercial paper program is supported by our revolving credit facility and provides a lower cost source of borrowing to fund short-term working capital requirements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper programs or revolving credit facilities. As of December 31, 2021, amounts available under our revolving credit facility, net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program and outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, totaled $11 billion.\n\n## Letters of Credit and Bank Guarantees\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we and certain of our subsidiaries had undrawn irrevocable standby letters of credit and bank guarantees totaling $341 million to cover potential fundings under various agreements.\n\n## Note 7: Significant Transactions\n\n## Universal Beijing Resort\n\nIn 2018, we entered into an agreement with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies to build and operate a Universal theme park  and  resort  in  Beijing,  China  ('Universal  Beijing  Resort'),  which  opened  in  September  2021.  We  own  a  30%  interest  in Universal Beijing Resort and the construction was funded through a combination of debt financing and equity contributions from the  investors  in  accordance  with  their  equity  interests.  The  debt  financing,  which  is  being  provided  by  a  syndicate  of  Chinese financial  institutions,  contains  certain  covenants  and  a  maximum  borrowing  limit  of  \u00a529.7  billion  RMB  (approximately  $4.7 billion), which was increased from \u00a526.6 billion RMB (approximately $4.2 billion) in the third quarter of 2021. The debt financing is secured by the assets of Universal Beijing Resort and the equity interests of the investors. As of December 31, 2021, Universal Beijing Resort had $3.6 billion of debt outstanding, including $3.1 billion principal amount of a term loan outstanding under the debt financing agreement.\n\nWe have concluded that Universal Beijing Resort is a VIE based on its governance structure, and we consolidate it because we have the  power  to  direct  activities  that  most  significantly  impact  its  economic  performance.  There  are  no  liquidity  arrangements, guarantees or other financial commitments between us and Universal Beijing Resort, and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss  is  our  30%  interest.  Universal  Beijing  Resort's  results  of  operations  are  reported  in  our  Theme  Parks  segment.  Our consolidated statement of cash flows includes the costs of construction and related borrowings in the 'construction of Universal Beijing Resort' and 'proceeds from borrowings' captions, respectively, and equity contributions from the noncontrolling interests are included in other financing activities.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, our consolidated balance sheet included assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort totaling $9.7 billion  and  $8.1  billion,  respectively.  The  assets  and  liabilities  of  Universal  Beijing  Resort  primarily  consist  of  property  and equipment, operating lease assets and liabilities, and debt.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the X1 platform integrated third-party streaming services such as Disney+ and Netflix, and provided access to Peacock's premium tier, with Comcast earning commission revenue from the sale of these services. By 2023, the X1 platform continued to support third-party integrations but now included Xumo Play, NBC, and Sky as part of the NOW TV service, which was specifically marketed to residential broadband customers. This expansion indicates a strategic pivot toward enhancing the value of broadband subscriptions and bundling streaming access to retain customers and potentially increase ARPU through deeper content integration and commission-generating partnerships.",

        "Step 3: The addition of new streaming partners and the focus on NOW TV within the broadband bundle suggest a strategic effort to reduce cord-cutting by offering a more compelling streaming-integrated video experience and potentially increasing ARPU through enhanced service offerings."

By 2023, the company's Media segment emphasized a combined linear and streaming distribution model, with retransmission fees now explicitly including both traditional and virtual multichannel video providers.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\n## NBCUniversal Segments\n\n## Advertising\n\nMedia generates revenue from the sale of advertising on our television networks, Peacock and digital properties.\n\nWe enter into advertising arrangements with customers and have determined that a contract exists once all terms and conditions are agreed  upon,  typically  when  the  number  of  advertising  units  is  specifically  identified  and  the  timing  of  airing  is  scheduled. Advertisements are generally aired or viewed within one year once all terms are agreed upon. Revenue is recognized, net of agency commissions, in the period in which advertisements are aired or viewed and payment occurs thereafter, with payment generally required within 30 days. In some instances, we guarantee audience ratings for the advertisements. To the extent there is a shortfall in  contracts  where  the  ratings  were  guaranteed,  a  portion  of  the  revenue  is  deferred  until  the  shortfall  is  settled,  typically  by providing additional advertising units generally within one year of the original airing.\n\n## Distribution\n\nMedia  generates  revenue  from  the  distribution  of  cable  network  programming  in  the  United  States  and  internationally  to multichannel  video  providers,  including  both  traditional  providers  of  linear  programming  and  virtual  providers  who  provide streaming services for linear programming. Media also generates revenue from the fees received from multichannel video providers under NBC and Telemundo retransmission consent agreements and associated fees from NBC-affiliated and Telemundo-affiliated local  broadcast  television  stations. Additionally,  Media  generates  revenue  from  monthly  subscription  fees  received  from  certain Peacock subscribers.\n\nMonthly fees received under distribution agreements with multichannel video providers are generally under multiyear agreements and based on the number of subscribers. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include payment  within  60  days.  These  arrangements  are  accounted  for  as  licenses  of  functional  intellectual  property  and  revenue  is recognized as programming is provided on a monthly basis.\n\n## Content Licensing\n\nStudios generates revenue from the licensing of our owned film and television content in the United States and internationally to cable, broadcast and premium networks and to DTC streaming service providers, as well as through video on demand and pay-perview services. Media also generates revenue from licensing of our owned television content, which is reported in other revenue. Our agreements generally include fixed pricing and span multiple years. For example, following a film's theatrical release, Studios may license the exhibition rights of a film to different customers over multiple successive distribution windows.\n\nWe recognize revenue when the content is delivered and available for use by the licensee. When the term of an existing agreement is renewed or extended, we recognize revenue at the later of when the content is available or when the renewal or extension period begins. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although payments are generally collected over the license term. The amount  of  future  revenue  to  be  earned  related  to  fixed  pricing  under  existing  third-party  agreements  at  any  given  time  equals approximately one half year to 1 year of annual Studios content licensing revenue, which is the segment with the largest portion of this  future  revenue. The  majority  of  this  revenue  will  be  recognized  within  2  years. This  amount  may  fluctuate  from  period  to period depending on the timing of the releases and the availability of content under existing agreements and may not represent the total revenue expected to be recognized as it does not include revenue from future agreements or from variable pricing or optional purchases under existing agreements.\n\nFor our agreements that include variable pricing, such as pricing based on the number of subscribers to a DTC streaming service sold by our customers, we generally recognize revenue as our customers sell to their subscribers.\n\n## Theatrical\n\nStudios generates revenue from the worldwide theatrical release of produced and acquired films for exhibition in movie theaters. Our arrangements with exhibitors generally entitle us to a percentage of ticket sales. We recognize revenue as the films are viewed and exhibited in theaters and payment generally occurs within 30 days after exhibition.\n\n## Home Entertainment\n\nStudios generates revenue from the sale of our produced and acquired films on DVDs and through digital distribution services. Media also generates revenue from the sale of owned programming on DVDs and through digital distribution services, which is reported in other revenue. We generally recognize revenue from DVD sales, net of estimated returns and customer incentives, on the date that DVDs are delivered to and made available for sale by retailers. Payment terms generally include payment within 60 to 90 days from delivery to the retailer.",

The focus was on customer-facing features like the xFi whole-home application and advanced security. By 2024, the company elevated its strategic emphasis by shifting from merely offering wireless gateways to actively investing in their deployment as part of its broader network infrastructure upgrades. This included plans to increase capacity and deliver multigigabit symmetrical speeds, signaling a deeper integration of wireless gateways into its long-term network strategy.",

In addition, we expect to continue investment in existing and new attractions at our Universal theme parks, including Epic Universe. Capital expenditures for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors, including competition, changes in technology, regulatory changes, the timing and rate of deployment of new services, the capacity required for existing services, the timing of new attractions at our theme parks and potential acquisitions.\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nNet  cash  used  in  financing  activities  decreased  in  2024  primarily  due  to  repayment  of  a  collateralized  obligation  in  the  prior  year  (see  Note  7),  a  decrease  in repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program and employee plans, lower repurchases and repayments of debt in the current year, repayments of short-term borrowings, net in the prior year and higher proceeds from borrowings in the current year.\n\nIn September 2024, we issued \u20ac1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate euro senior notes maturing in 2032 and 2036 and entered into a corresponding cross-currency swap, effectively converting the debt to an aggregate U.S. dollar principal amount of $2.0 billion with a weighted-average interest rate of 4.72%. We also issued \u00a3750 million ($1.0 billion using ex change rates on the date of issuance) principal amount of fix ed rate sterling senior notes maturing in 2040 with an interest rate of 5.25%. The net proceeds from this issuance were intended for working capital and general corporate purposes, including the early redemption of $725 million of  our  outstanding  5.25%  Notes  due  2025,  which  was  completed  in  October  2024,  and  the  repayment  of  certain  of  our  other  outstanding  debt  with  near-term maturities. In May 2024, we issued $3.3 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate senior notes, which have maturities ranging between 2029 and 2054 and a weighted-average interest rate of 5.38%. The net proceeds from this issuance were used for the repayment of our outstanding commercial paper, and for working capital and general corporate purposes.\n\nIn 2024, we made debt repayments of $3.6 billion, including $1.9 billion principal amount of notes due at maturity and $750 million of 5.250% Notes due 2025, $391 million of 3.950% Notes due 2025, $256 million of 3.375% Notes due 2025, and $104 million of 3.150% Notes due 2026.\n\nWe have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. Any such repurchases may be effected through privately negotiated transactions, market transactions, tender offers, redemptions or otherwise. In particular, we may repurchase varying amounts of our outstanding public notes and debentures with short to medium term maturities through privately negotiated or market transactions. See Notes 6 and 7 for additional information on our financing activities.\n\n## Share Repurchases and Dividends\n\nIn the second quarter of 2021, we restarted our share repurchase program, which had been paused since the beginning of 2019. In January 2024, our Board of Directors terminated our existing program and approved a new share repurchase program authorization of $15 billion effective as of January 26, 2024, which had no expiration date. In 2024, we repurchased a total of 212 million shares of our Class A common stock for $8.6 billion under our authorization programs. We did not purchase any shares outside of these programs. As of December 31, 2024, we had $7.0 billion remaining under the authorization, and in January 2025, our Board of Directors terminated the existing program and approved a new share repurchase program authorization of $15 billion, which has no expiration date. We expect to repurchase additional shares of our Class A common stock under this new authorization in the open market or in private transactions, subject to market and other conditions.\n\nIn 2024, our Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends of $0.31 per share, including our fourth quarter dividend payable in January 2025 and we made dividend payments of $4.8 billion. In January 2025, our Board of Directors approved a 6.5% increase in our dividend to $1.32 per share on an annualized basis and approved our first quarter dividend of $0.33 per share, to be paid in April 2025. We ex pect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\n## Nonmarketable Equity Securities\n\nWe classify  investments  without  readily  determinable  fair  values  that  are  not  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  as  nonmarketable  equity  securities.  The accounting guidance requires nonmarketable equity securities to be recorded at cost and adjusted to fair value at each reporting period. However, the guidance allows for a measurement alternative, which is to record the investments at cost, less impairment, if any, and subsequently adjust for observable price changes of identical or similar investments of the same issuer.  We generally apply the measurement alternative, adjusting the investments for observable price changes of identical or similar investments of the same issuer, to our nonmarketable equity securities. When an observable event occurs, we estimate the fair values of our nonmarketable equity securities primarily based on Level 2 inputs that are derived from observable price changes of similar securities adjusted for insignificant differences in rights and obligations. The changes in value are recorded in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net.\n\n## Other Investments\n\nOther investments also includes certain short-term instruments with maturities over three months when purchased, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit and U.S. government obligations, that are generally accounted for at amortized cost. We had no short-term instruments as of December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, these short-term instruments totaled $254 million. The carrying amounts of these investments approximate their fair values, which are primarily based on Level 2 inputs  that  use  interest  rates  for  instruments  with  similar  terms  and  remaining  maturities.  Proceeds  from  short-term  instruments  in  2024,  2023  and 2022  were $702 million, $560 million and $1.6 billion, respectively. Purchases of short-term instruments in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $443 million, $506 million and $1.8 billion, respectively.\n\n## Impairment Testing of Investments\n\nWe  review  our  investment  portfolio,  other  than  our  marketable  equity  securities,  each  reporting  period  to  determine  whether  there  are  identified  events  or circumstances that would indicate there is a decline in the fair value. For our nonpublic investments, if there are no identified events or circumstances that would have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment, then the fair value is not estimated. For our equity method investments, if an investment is deemed to have experienced an other-than-temporary decline below its cost basis, we reduce the carrying amount of the investment to its quoted or estimated fair value, as applicable, and establish a new cost basis for the investment. For our nonmarketable equity securities, we record the impairment to realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. For our equity method investments, we record the impairment to other income (loss), net.\n\n## Consolidated Variable Interest Entity\n\n## Universal Beijing Resort\n\nIn 2018, we entered into an agreement with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies to build and operate a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China ('Universal  Beijing  Resort'), which opened in  September 2021.  We own a 30% interest in Universal Beijing Resort and the construction was funded through a combination of debt financing and equity contributions from the partners in accordance with their equity interests. The debt financing, which is being provided by a syndicate of Chinese financial institutions, contains certain covenants and a maximum borrowing limit of \u00a529.7 billion RMB (approximately $4.2 billion). The debt financing is secured by the assets of Universal Beijing Resort and the equity interests of the investors. As of December 31, 2024, Universal Beijing Resort had $3.4 billion of debt outstanding, including $3.0 billion principal amount of a term loan outstanding under the debt financing agreement. As of December 31, 2023, Universal Beijing Resort had $3.5 billion of debt outstanding, including $3.1 billion principal amount of a term loan outstanding under the debt financing agreement.\n\nWe have concluded that Universal Beijing Resort is a VIE based on its governance structure, and we consolidate it because we have the power to direct activities that most significantly impact its economic performance. There are no liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other financial commitments between us and Universal Beijing Resort, and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss is our 30% interest. Universal Beijing Resort's results of operations are reported in our Theme Parks segment. Our consolidated statements of cash flows includes the costs of construction and related borrowings in the 'construction of Universal Beijing Resort' and 'proceeds from borrowings' captions, respectively, and equity contributions from the noncontrolling interests are included in other financing activities.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, our consolidated balance sheets included assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort totaling $7.3 billion and $7.0 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, our consolidated balance sheets included assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort totaling $7.8 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively. The assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort primarily consist of property and equipment, operating lease assets and liabilities, and debt.",

Equity method investments are recorded at cost and are adjusted to recognize (1) our share, based on percentage ownership or other contractual basis, of the investee's net income or loss after the date of investment, (2) amortization of the recorded investment that exceeds our share of the book value of the investee's net assets, (3) additional contributions made and dividends or other distributions received, and (4) impairments resulting from other-than-temporary declines in fair value. For some investments, we record our share of the investee's net income or loss one quarter in arrears due to the timing of our receipt of such information. G ains or losses on the sale of equity method investments are recorded to other income (loss), net. If an equity method investee were to issue additional securities that would change our proportionate share of the entity, we would recognize the change, if any, as a gain or loss to oth er income (loss), net. Cash distributions received from equity method investments are considered returns on investment and are presented within operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows to the extent of cumulative equity in net income of the investee. Additional distributions are presented as investing activities. Distributions presented within operating activities totaled $297 million, $217 million and $162 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Atairos\n\nOn January 1, 2016, we established Atairos G roup, Inc., a strategic company focused on investing in and operating companies in a range of industries and business sectors, both domestically and internationally. Atairos is controlled by management companies led by our former CFO through interests that carry all of the voting rights. We are the only third-party investor in Atairos.\n\nIn November 2020, we amended our agreement with Atairos, which primarily extended the investment term of the agreement from up to 12 years to up to 16.5 years, extended the period in which capital can be recycled to the full investment period and decreased our commitment to fund Atairos from up to $5 billion to up to $4.5 billion in the aggregate at any one time, subject to certain offsets, with the max imum amount of annual capital calls reduced to $400 million, plus certain amounts previously distributed. In addition, we have separately committed to fund Atairos $40 million annually for a management fee, subject to certain adjustments. The management company investors have committed to fund from $50 million to $100 million, with at least $40 million to be funded by our former CFO, subject to his continued role with Atairos. Our economic interests do not carry voting rights and obligate us to absorb approximately 99% of any losses and they provide us the right to receive approximately 86% of any residual returns in Atairos, in either case on a cumulative basis.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "question": "Compare Comcast's wireless gateway procurement strategy in 2022 with its network deployment investment focus in 2024.",
      "answer": "In 2022, Comcast's relationship with wireless gateways was primarily centered on procurement, as the company purchased a significant amount of customer premise equipment, including wireless gateways, from a limited number of suppliers to provide services to residential and business customers. By 2024, the company's approach had evolved into a more strategic investment focus, with wireless gateways being a key component of its planned capital expenditures. Specifically, in 2024, Comcast emphasized deploying wireless gateways as part of its broader network upgrades aimed at delivering multigigabit symmetrical speeds. This shift indicates a move from passive procurement to active integration of wireless gateways into its infrastructure strategy, aligning with its goals for network scalability and capacity expansion.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 - In 2022, Comcast was purchasing wireless gateways as part of its customer premise equipment supply chain.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 - In 2024, Comcast was strategically investing in the deployment of wireless gateways as part of its network infrastructure upgrades.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The relationship evolved from procurement to strategic deployment, indicating a deeper integration of wireless gateways into Comcast's infrastructure planning."

We also offer Ethernet network services, which  connect  multiple  locations  and  provide  higher  downstream  and  upstream  speed  options  to  medium-sized  customers  and larger enterprises, and advanced voice services, as well as video solutions for hotels and other large venues. In addition, we provide cellular backhaul services to mobile network operators to help manage their network bandwidth.\n\nOur business services offerings for medium-sized and enterprise customers also include a software-defined networking product, and larger enterprises may also receive support services related to Wi-Fi networks, router management, network security, business continuity risks and other services. These services are primarily provided to Fortune 1000 companies and other large enterprises with  multiple  locations  both  within  and  outside  of  our  cable  distribution  footprint,  where  we  provide  coverage  outside  of  our service areas through agreements with other companies to use their networks.\n\n## Advertising\n\nWe generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time that our advertising business sells to local, regional and national advertisers as part of our distribution agreements with cable networks, and we also generate revenue from selling advertising on our digital  platforms.  Our  advertising  business  also  represents  the  advertising  sales  efforts  of  other  multichannel  video  providers  in some markets and offers additional technology, tools, data-driven services and marketplace solutions to customers in the media industry to facilitate advertisers more effectively engaging with their target audiences.\n\n## Other\n\nOur security and automation services provide home monitoring services and the ability to manage other functions within the home, such as lighting and room temperature, through our online portal, mobile apps and the X1 platform. We also license our technology platforms to other multichannel video providers.\n\n## Network and Technology\n\nOur  Cable  Communications  cable  distribution  system  uses  a  hybrid  fiber-optic  and  coaxial  cable  network  that  we  believe  is sufficiently flexible and scalable to support our future technology requirements and enables us to continue to grow capacity and capabilities  over  time.  This  network  provides  the  two-way  transmissions  that  are  essential  to  providing  broadband  services, interactive  video  services  such  as  integrated  search  functionality,  On  Demand  and  DVR,  voice  services,  and  security  and automation  services.  Leveraging  DOCSIS  3.1  technology,  Cable  Communications  currently  deploys  broadband  services  with downstream speeds for residential customers up to over a gigabit per second across nearly our entire footprint. We continue to evolve and enhance our network and plan to leverage DOCSIS 4.0 technology to begin deploying multigigabit symmetrical speeds in the future. Additionally, Cable Communications has been automating many core network functions in order to expand capacity and increase operating efficiency and to identify and fix network issues before they affect our customers.\n\nCable  Communications  continues  to  focus  on  technology  initiatives  to  design,  develop  and  deploy  next-generation  media  and content  delivery  platforms,  such  as  the  X1  and  Flex  platforms  and  cloud  DVR  technology  that  use  Internet  Protocol  ('IP') technology and our own cloud network servers to deliver video and advanced search capability. These platforms are based on our global technology platform, which integrates linear television networks, certain owned and third-party DTC streaming services and other  internet-based  apps,  and  on  demand  content  in  one  unified  experience  with  voice-activated  remote  control  search  and interactive  features.  Cable  Communications  also  pursues  technology  initiatives  related  to  broadband  services  that  leverage  our global technology platform, providing customers with in-and-out-of-home Wi-Fi, the ability to manage their Wi-Fi network and connected home with our xFi whole-home application and online portal, advanced security technology and other features.\n\n## Sources of Supply and Other Operations\n\nTo offer video services, Cable Communications licenses substantial amounts of programming from cable and broadcast networks, as  well  as  from  local  broadcast  television  stations.  The  fees  associated  with  these  programming  distribution  agreements  are generally based on the number of subscribers who are able to watch the programming and the platforms on which the content is provided. We seek to include in distribution agreements the rights to offer such programming through multiple delivery platforms, such as through our On Demand service, online portal, mobile apps and Flex.\n\nFor  wireless  services,  we  have  an  MVNO  agreement  that  allows  us  to  offer  services  using  Verizon's  wireless  network  and  we purchase from a limited number of suppliers a significant number of wireless handsets, tablets and smart watches that we sell to wireless customers.\n\nCable  Communications  purchases  from  a  limited  number  of  suppliers  a  significant  amount  of  customer  premise  equipment, including  wireless  gateways  and  set-top  boxes,  network  equipment  and  services  to  provide  services  to  residential  and  business customers.\n\nCable Communications uses two primary vendors to provide customer billing for our residential and business customers.\n\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

In addition, we expect to continue investment in existing and new attractions at our Universal theme parks, including Epic Universe. Capital expenditures for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors, including competition, changes in technology, regulatory changes, the timing and rate of deployment of new services, the capacity required for existing services, the timing of new attractions at our theme parks and potential acquisitions.\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nNet  cash  used  in  financing  activities  decreased  in  2024  primarily  due  to  repayment  of  a  collateralized  obligation  in  the  prior  year  (see  Note  7),  a  decrease  in repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program and employee plans, lower repurchases and repayments of debt in the current year, repayments of short-term borrowings, net in the prior year and higher proceeds from borrowings in the current year.\n\nIn September 2024, we issued \u20ac1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate euro senior notes maturing in 2032 and 2036 and entered into a corresponding cross-currency swap, effectively converting the debt to an aggregate U.S. dollar principal amount of $2.0 billion with a weighted-average interest rate of 4.72%. We also issued \u00a3750 million ($1.0 billion using ex change rates on the date of issuance) principal amount of fix ed rate sterling senior notes maturing in 2040 with an interest rate of 5.25%. The net proceeds from this issuance were intended for working capital and general corporate purposes, including the early redemption of $725 million of  our  outstanding  5.25%  Notes  due  2025,  which  was  completed  in  October  2024,  and  the  repayment  of  certain  of  our  other  outstanding  debt  with  near-term maturities. In May 2024, we issued $3.3 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate senior notes, which have maturities ranging between 2029 and 2054 and a weighted-average interest rate of 5.38%. The net proceeds from this issuance were used for the repayment of our outstanding commercial paper, and for working capital and general corporate purposes.\n\nIn 2024, we made debt repayments of $3.6 billion, including $1.9 billion principal amount of notes due at maturity and $750 million of 5.250% Notes due 2025, $391 million of 3.950% Notes due 2025, $256 million of 3.375% Notes due 2025, and $104 million of 3.150% Notes due 2026.\n\nWe have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. Any such repurchases may be effected through privately negotiated transactions, market transactions, tender offers, redemptions or otherwise. In particular, we may repurchase varying amounts of our outstanding public notes and debentures with short to medium term maturities through privately negotiated or market transactions. See Notes 6 and 7 for additional information on our financing activities.\n\n## Share Repurchases and Dividends\n\nIn the second quarter of 2021, we restarted our share repurchase program, which had been paused since the beginning of 2019. In January 2024, our Board of Directors terminated our existing program and approved a new share repurchase program authorization of $15 billion effective as of January 26, 2024, which had no expiration date. In 2024, we repurchased a total of 212 million shares of our Class A common stock for $8.6 billion under our authorization programs. We did not purchase any shares outside of these programs. As of December 31, 2024, we had $7.0 billion remaining under the authorization, and in January 2025, our Board of Directors terminated the existing program and approved a new share repurchase program authorization of $15 billion, which has no expiration date. We expect to repurchase additional shares of our Class A common stock under this new authorization in the open market or in private transactions, subject to market and other conditions.\n\nIn 2024, our Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends of $0.31 per share, including our fourth quarter dividend payable in January 2025 and we made dividend payments of $4.8 billion. In January 2025, our Board of Directors approved a 6.5% increase in our dividend to $1.32 per share on an annualized basis and approved our first quarter dividend of $0.33 per share, to be paid in April 2025. We ex pect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

The accounting guidance requires nonmarketable equity securities to be recorded at cost and adjusted to fair value at each reporting period. However, the guidance allows for a measurement alternative, which is to record the investments at cost, less impairment, if any, and subsequently adjust for observable price changes of identical or similar investments of the same issuer.  We generally apply the measurement alternative, adjusting the investments for observable price changes of identical or similar investments of the same issuer, to our nonmarketable equity securities. When an observable event occurs, we estimate the fair values of our nonmarketable equity securities primarily based on Level 2 inputs that are derived from observable price changes of similar securities adjusted for insignificant differences in rights and obligations. The changes in value are recorded in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net.\n\n## Other Investments\n\nOther investments also includes certain short-term instruments with maturities over three months when purchased, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit and U.S. government obligations, that are generally accounted for at amortized cost. We had no short-term instruments as of December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, these short-term instruments totaled $254 million. The carrying amounts of these investments approximate their fair values, which are primarily based on Level 2 inputs  that  use  interest  rates  for  instruments  with  similar  terms  and  remaining  maturities.  Proceeds  from  short-term  instruments  in  2024,  2023  and 2022  were $702 million, $560 million and $1.6 billion, respectively. Purchases of short-term instruments in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $443 million, $506 million and $1.8 billion, respectively.\n\n## Impairment Testing of Investments\n\nWe  review  our  investment  portfolio,  other  than  our  marketable  equity  securities,  each  reporting  period  to  determine  whether  there  are  identified  events  or circumstances that would indicate there is a decline in the fair value. For our nonpublic investments, if there are no identified events or circumstances that would have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment, then the fair value is not estimated. For our equity method investments, if an investment is deemed to have experienced an other-than-temporary decline below its cost basis, we reduce the carrying amount of the investment to its quoted or estimated fair value, as applicable, and establish a new cost basis for the investment. For our nonmarketable equity securities, we record the impairment to realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. For our equity method investments, we record the impairment to other income (loss), net.\n\n## Consolidated Variable Interest Entity\n\n## Universal Beijing Resort\n\nIn 2018, we entered into an agreement with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies to build and operate a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China ('Universal  Beijing  Resort'), which opened in  September 2021.  We own a 30% interest in Universal Beijing Resort and the construction was funded through a combination of debt financing and equity contributions from the partners in accordance with their equity interests. The debt financing, which is being provided by a syndicate of Chinese financial institutions, contains certain covenants and a maximum borrowing limit of \u00a529.7 billion RMB (approximately $4.2 billion). The debt financing is secured by the assets of Universal Beijing Resort and the equity interests of the investors. As of December 31, 2024, Universal Beijing Resort had $3.4 billion of debt outstanding, including $3.0 billion principal amount of a term loan outstanding under the debt financing agreement. As of December 31, 2023, Universal Beijing Resort had $3.5 billion of debt outstanding, including $3.1 billion principal amount of a term loan outstanding under the debt financing agreement.\n\nWe have concluded that Universal Beijing Resort is a VIE based on its governance structure, and we consolidate it because we have the power to direct activities that most significantly impact its economic performance. There are no liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other financial commitments between us and Universal Beijing Resort, and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss is our 30% interest. Universal Beijing Resort's results of operations are reported in our Theme Parks segment. Our consolidated statements of cash flows includes the costs of construction and related borrowings in the 'construction of Universal Beijing Resort' and 'proceeds from borrowings' captions, respectively, and equity contributions from the noncontrolling interests are included in other financing activities.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, our consolidated balance sheets included assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort totaling $7.3 billion and $7.0 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, our consolidated balance sheets included assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort totaling $7.8 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively. The assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort primarily consist of property and equipment, operating lease assets and liabilities, and debt.",

      "question": "How has the positioning and market strategy for Disney+ Hotstar evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of its regional branding and service structure?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Disney+ Hotstar was described as a DTC service primarily in India that offered general entertainment, family, and sports programming. It was positioned as a distinct regional brand within Disney\u2019s broader Direct-to-Consumer portfolio. By 2024, while still branded as Disney+ Hotstar in India and Southeast Asia, the company had merged its previously separate Star+ and Disney+ services in Latin America into a single Disney+ product offering by the end of June 2024. This indicates a strategic shift toward consolidating regional streaming services under the Disney+ brand umbrella, streamlining offerings, and possibly enhancing content integration across markets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, Disney+ Hotstar was specifically branded for India, offering a mix of entertainment and sports content, and was listed as a distinct DTC service within the portfolio.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the company merged Star+ and Disney+ into a single product in Latin America, signaling a shift toward brand unification and simplified service structures.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a broader evolution in market strategy, moving from regionally differentiated branding (e.g., Hotstar in India, Star+ in Latin America) to a more unified Disney+ global identity with localized branding."

See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\n\n## New Accounting Pronouncements\n\nSee Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements.\n\n## DTC PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS, KEY DEFINITIONS AND SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\n\n## Product Offerings\n\nIn the U.S., Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu SVOD Only are each offered as a standalone service or as part of various multi-product offerings. Hulu Live TV + SVOD includes Disney+ and ESPN+. Disney+ is available in more than 150 countries and territories outside the U.S. and Canada. In India and certain other Southeast Asian countries, the service is branded Disney+ Hotstar. In certain Latin American countries prior to July 2024, we offered Disney+ as well as Star+, a general entertainment SVOD service, which was available on a standalone basis or together with Disney+ (Combo+). At the end of June 2024, we merged these services into a single Disney+ product offering. Depending on the market, our services can be purchased on our websites or through third-party platforms/apps or are available via wholesale arrangements.\n\n## Paid Subscribers\n\nPaid subscribers reflect subscribers for which we recognized subscription revenue. Certain product offerings provide the option for an extra member to be added to an account (extra member add-on). These extra members are not counted as paid subscribers. Subscribers cease to be a paid subscriber as of their effective cancellation date or as a result of a failed payment method. Subscribers to multi-product offerings in the U.S. are counted as a paid subscriber for each of the Company's services included in the multi-product offering and subscribers to Hulu Live TV + SVOD are counted as one paid subscriber for each of the Hulu Live TV + SVOD, Disney+ and ESPN+ services. In Latin America prior to July 2024, if a subscriber had either the standalone Disney+ or Star+ service or subscribed to Combo+, the subscriber was counted as one Disney+ paid subscriber. Subscribers include those who receive an entitlement to a service through wholesale arrangements, including those for which the service is available to each subscriber of an existing content distribution tier. When we aggregate the total number of paid subscribers across our DTC streaming services, we refer to them as paid subscriptions.\n\n## International Disney+ (excluding Disney+ Hotstar)\n\nInternational Disney+ (excluding Disney+ Hotstar) includes the Disney+ service outside the U.S. and Canada.\n\n## Average Monthly Revenue Per Paid Subscriber\n\nHulu and ESPN+ average monthly revenue per paid subscriber is calculated based on the average of the monthly average paid subscribers for each month in the period. The monthly average paid subscribers is calculated as the sum of the beginning of the month and end of the month paid subscriber count, divided by two. Disney+ average monthly revenue per paid subscriber is calculated using a daily average of paid subscribers for the period. Revenue includes subscription fees, advertising (excluding revenue earned from selling advertising spots to other Company businesses), premium and feature add-on revenue and extra member add-on revenue but excludes Pay-Per-View revenue. Advertising revenue generated by content on one DTC streaming service that is accessed through another DTC streaming service by subscribers to both streaming services is allocated between both streaming services. The average revenue per paid subscriber is net of discounts on offerings that carry more than one service. Revenue is allocated to each service based on the relative retail or wholesale price of each service on a standalone basis. Hulu Live TV + SVOD revenue is allocated to the SVOD services based on the wholesale price of the Hulu SVOD Only, Disney+ and ESPN+ multiproduct offering. In general, wholesale arrangements have a lower average monthly revenue per paid subscriber than subscribers that we acquire directly or through third-party platforms.",

      "answer": "In 2023, ABC Network was positioned as a core component of Disney's 'Linear Networks' within the Entertainment segment, specifically highlighting its domestic footprint through eight owned ABC television stations and its role in content distribution. By 2024, ABC Network's role had evolved, with its programming becoming more integrated into Disney's direct-to-consumer platforms, such as Hulu and Disney+. Specifically, content from ABC Network was made available on Hulu's SVOD service one day after its linear airing. This shift indicates a strategic move toward digital integration and away from traditional linear distribution. Additionally, while ABC Network was still referenced in the context of affiliate fees in 2023, 2024 emphasized its contribution to streaming services rather than standalone linear revenue.",

Outside the U.S., Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar also include international sports programming. The services are offered individually or in various bundles, which may include ESPN+ (see Sports segment discussion), to customers directly or through third-party distributors on mobile and internet connected devices. The majority of Direct-to-Consumer revenue is derived from subscription fees and advertising.\n\n## Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar\n\nDisney+ is a subscription-based DTC service with Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic branded programming, which are all top-level selections or 'tiles' within the Disney+ interface. In the U.S., subscribers to both Disney+ and Hulu may access certain Hulu programming through a tile on Disney+. Outside the U.S., Disney+ includes a Star branded tile, which features general entertainment programming. In Latin America, Disney+ includes an ESPN branded tile, which features a variety of sports content including live events. The Company plans to launch an ESPN branded tile on Disney+ in the U.S. in early fiscal 2025.\n\nIn certain Latin American countries prior to July 2024, we offered Disney+ as well as Star+, a standalone service with a variety of general entertainment and family content and live sports programming. At the end of June 2024, we merged these services into a single Disney+ product offering.\n\nAs of September 28, 2024, the estimated number of paid Disney+ subscribers, based on internal management reports, was approximately 123 million.\n\nDisney+ Hotstar is a subscription-based DTC service available in India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. Programming includes television shows, movies, sports and original series in approx imately 10 languages, in addition to gaming and social features.

Cumulatively through September 28, 2024, the Company has released approximately 1,100 full-length live-action films and 100 full-length animated films. In the domestic and most major international markets, we generally distribute and market our films directly. In certain international markets our films are distributed by independent companies. In some territories, certain films may be ex clusively distributed on our DTC streaming services. During fiscal 2025, we expect to release approximately 15 films.",

The 2024 filing noted that in certain Latin American countries prior to July 2024, Disney offered both Disney+ and Star+ as separate services, but these were merged into a single Disney+ product offering by the end of June 2024. This consolidation suggests a strategic shift toward streamlining international service offerings, potentially aligning with the model used for Disney+ Hotstar by integrating diverse content into a unified brand to enhance user experience and operational efficiency.",

See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\n\n## New Accounting Pronouncements\n\nSee Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements.\n\n## DTC PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS, KEY DEFINITIONS AND SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\n\n## Product Offerings\n\nIn the U.S., Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu SVOD Only are each offered as a standalone service or as part of various multi-product offerings. Hulu Live TV + SVOD includes Disney+ and ESPN+. Disney+ is available in more than 150 countries and territories outside the U.S. and Canada. In India and certain other Southeast Asian countries, the service is branded Disney+ Hotstar. In certain Latin American countries prior to July 2024, we offered Disney+ as well as Star+, a general entertainment SVOD service, which was available on a standalone basis or together with Disney+ (Combo+). At the end of June 2024, we merged these services into a single Disney+ product offering. Depending on the market, our services can be purchased on our websites or through third-party platforms/apps or are available via wholesale arrangements.\n\n## Paid Subscribers\n\nPaid subscribers reflect subscribers for which we recognized subscription revenue. Certain product offerings provide the option for an extra member to be added to an account (extra member add-on). These extra members are not counted as paid subscribers. Subscribers cease to be a paid subscriber as of their effective cancellation date or as a result of a failed payment method. Subscribers to multi-product offerings in the U.S. are counted as a paid subscriber for each of the Company's services included in the multi-product offering and subscribers to Hulu Live TV + SVOD are counted as one paid subscriber for each of the Hulu Live TV + SVOD, Disney+ and ESPN+ services. In Latin America prior to July 2024, if a subscriber had either the standalone Disney+ or Star+ service or subscribed to Combo+, the subscriber was counted as one Disney+ paid subscriber. Subscribers include those who receive an entitlement to a service through wholesale arrangements, including those for which the service is available to each subscriber of an existing content distribution tier. When we aggregate the total number of paid subscribers across our DTC streaming services, we refer to them as paid subscriptions.\n\n## International Disney+ (excluding Disney+ Hotstar)\n\nInternational Disney+ (excluding Disney+ Hotstar) includes the Disney+ service outside the U.S. and Canada.\n\n## Average Monthly Revenue Per Paid Subscriber\n\nHulu and ESPN+ average monthly revenue per paid subscriber is calculated based on the average of the monthly average paid subscribers for each month in the period. The monthly average paid subscribers is calculated as the sum of the beginning of the month and end of the month paid subscriber count, divided by two. Disney+ average monthly revenue per paid subscriber is calculated using a daily average of paid subscribers for the period. Revenue includes subscription fees, advertising (excluding revenue earned from selling advertising spots to other Company businesses), premium and feature add-on revenue and extra member add-on revenue but excludes Pay-Per-View revenue. Advertising revenue generated by content on one DTC streaming service that is accessed through another DTC streaming service by subscribers to both streaming services is allocated between both streaming services. The average revenue per paid subscriber is net of discounts on offerings that carry more than one service. Revenue is allocated to each service based on the relative retail or wholesale price of each service on a standalone basis. Hulu Live TV + SVOD revenue is allocated to the SVOD services based on the wholesale price of the Hulu SVOD Only, Disney+ and ESPN+ multiproduct offering. In general, wholesale arrangements have a lower average monthly revenue per paid subscriber than subscribers that we acquire directly or through third-party platforms.",

      "question": "How has Disney's relationship with National Geographic magazine evolved between 2023 and 2024 in terms of its business structure and strategic positioning within the company's portfolio?",
      "answer": "In 2023, National Geographic magazine was explicitly described as part of the Entertainment segment under Content Sales/Licensing, and was noted as being 73% owned by Disney. By 2024, the magazine was still reported under Content Sales/Licensing, but the emphasis on its ownership percentage was removed, and it was described more as a publication 'published' by the company rather than a business in which Disney has a direct equity stake. This shift indicates a more operational rather than ownership-focused relationship in 2024 compared to 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2023, National Geographic magazine was described as part of the Entertainment segment under Content Sales/Licensing and noted as 73% owned by Disney.",
        "In 2024, the magazine was again reported under Content Sales/Licensing, but the ownership percentage was not mentioned, and the language shifted to 'publishes' rather than 'owned'.",
        "The change in language and omission of ownership percentage suggests a shift in strategic positioning, moving from a partially owned asset to a more integrated operational component."

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n## Direct-to-Consumer\n\nDisney+, Disney+ Hotstar and Hulu are subscription services that provide video streaming of the Company's general entertainment and family programming and similar programming from third parties. Outside the U.S., Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar also include international sports programming. The services are offered individually or in various bundles, which may include ESPN+ (see Sports segment discussion), to customers directly or through third-party distributors on mobile and internet connected devices. The majority of Direct-to-Consumer revenue is derived from subscription fees and advertising.\n\n## Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar\n\nDisney+ is a subscription-based DTC service with Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic branded programming, which are all top-level selections or 'tiles' within the Disney+ interface. In the U.S., subscribers to both Disney+ and Hulu may access certain Hulu programming through a tile on Disney+. Outside the U.S., Disney+ includes a Star branded tile, which features general entertainment programming. In Latin America, Disney+ includes an ESPN branded tile, which features a variety of sports content including live events. The Company plans to launch an ESPN branded tile on Disney+ in the U.S. in early fiscal 2025.\n\nIn certain Latin American countries prior to July 2024, we offered Disney+ as well as Star+, a standalone service with a variety of general entertainment and family content and live sports programming. At the end of June 2024, we merged these services into a single Disney+ product offering.\n\nAs of September 28, 2024, the estimated number of paid Disney+ subscribers, based on internal management reports, was approximately 123 million.\n\nDisney+ Hotstar is a subscription-based DTC service available in India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. Programming includes television shows, movies, sports and original series in approx imately 10 languages, in addition to gaming and social features. Disney+ Hotstar has exclusive streaming rights to certain cricket programming.\n\nAs of September 28, 2024, the estimated number of paid Disney+ Hotstar subscribers, based on internal management reports, was approximately 36 million.\n\nDisney+ and Disney+ Hotstar offer content from the Company's various studios, including library titles, as well as content acquired from third parties.\n\nThe majority of Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar revenue is derived from subscription fees and, to a lesser extent, advertising. The Company offers an adsupported Disney+ service in the U.S., Canada and select Latin American and European markets.\n\n## Hulu\n\nHulu is a domestic subscription-based DTC service with general entertainment content from the Company's various studios as well as content licensed from third parties. Hulu's revenue is derived from subscription fees and advertising. Hulu offers subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) services with or without advertising in addition to a digital OTT MVPD (Live TV) service. The Live TV service is available with either of Hulu's SVOD services and includes live linear streams of various cable and broadcast networks. In addition, Hulu offers subscriptions to premium services such as Max, Cinemax, Starz and Paramount+ with Showtime, which can be added to the Hulu service. Certain programming from ABC Network, Freeform and FX Channels is also available on the Hulu SVOD service one day after the linear airing on these channels. As of September 28, 2024, the estimated number of paid Hulu subscribers, based on internal management reports, was approximately 52 million.\n\n## Content Sales/Licensing and Other\n\nThe majority of Content Sales/Licensing revenue is derived from TV/VOD, theatrical and home entertainment distribution. In addition, revenue is generated from music distribution, stage plays and post-production services through Industrial Light &amp; Magic and Skywalker Sound.\n\nThe Company also publishes National Geographic magazine, which is reported with Content Sales/Licensing.\n\n## TV/VOD Distribution\n\nWe license our content to third-party television networks, television stations and other video service providers for distribution to viewers on television or a variety of internet-connected devices, including through other DTC services.\n\n## Theatrical Distribution\n\nThe Company licenses full-length live-action and animated films to theaters globally. Cumulatively through September 28, 2024, the Company has released approximately 1,100 full-length live-action films and 100 full-length animated films. In the domestic and most major international markets, we generally distribute and market our films directly. In certain international markets our films are distributed by independent companies. In some territories, certain films may be ex clusively distributed on our DTC streaming services. During fiscal 2025, we expect to release approximately 15 films.",

They may offer more compelling content or secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video. In addition, new technological developments, including the development and use of generative artificial intelligence, are rapidly evolving. If our competitors gain an advantage by using such technologies more effectively to satisfy consumer demand, our ability to compete successfully and our results of operations could be adversely impacted. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. Piracy also threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. In light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth, and our efforts to prevent that growth may be insufficient. If we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors and win moments of truth, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share, revenues or profitability.\n\n## We face risks, such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute through our service.\n\nAs a producer and distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright and trademark infringement, or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute. We also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service, including marketing materials. We devote significant resources toward the development, production, marketing and distribution of original programming. We believe that original and exclusive programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings, enhance our brand and otherwise attract and retain members. To the extent our programming does not meet our expectations, in particular, in terms of costs, viewing and popularity, our business, including our brand and results of operations may be adversely impacted. As a content producer, we are responsible for production costs and other expenses, such as ongoing guild payments, and take on risks associated with production, such as completion and key talent risk. Further, negotiations or renewals related to entertainment industry collective bargaining agreements have, and in the future, could negatively impact timing and costs associated with our productions. We contract with third parties related to the development, production, marketing and distribution of our original programming. We may face potential liability or may suffer significant losses in connection with these arrangements, including but not limited to if such third parties violate applicable law, become insolvent or engage in fraudulent behavior. To the extent we create and sell physical or digital merchandise relating to our programming, and/or license such rights to third parties, we could become subject to product liability, intellectual property or other claims related to such merchandise. We may decide to remove content from our service, not to place licensed or produced content on our service or discontinue or alter production of original content if we believe such content might not be well received by our members, is prohibited by law, or could be damaging to our brand or business.\n\nTo the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks, including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on or is removed from our service, or if we become liable for content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute, our business may suffer. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations. We may not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims.\n\n## If we are not able to manage change and growth, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nWe are expanding our operations, scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members and features related to our services, such as introducing games and advertising on our service, as well as offering live programming and expanding our consumer products and experiences. We are also scaling our own studio operations to produce original content. As our international offering evolves, we are managing and adjusting our business to address varied content offerings, consumer customs and practices, in particular those dealing with e-commerce and streaming video, as well as differing legal and regulatory environments. As we scale our streaming service and introduce new features such as our ad-supported subscription plan and live programming, we are developing technology and utilizing third-party 'cloud' computing, technology and other services. As we scale our content production, including games, and introduce new features and expand our consumer products and experience offerings, we are building out expertise in a number of disciplines, including creative, marketing, legal, finance, licensing, merchandising and other resources, which requires significant resources and management attention. Further, we may expand our content and service offerings in a manner that is not well received by consumers. As we grow our operations, we may face integration and operational challenges as well as potential unknown liabilities and reputational concerns in connection with partners we work with or companies we may acquire or control. If we are not able to manage the growing complexity of our business, including improving, refining or evolving our corporate culture, as well as our systems and operational practices related to our streaming operations and original content, our business may be adversely affected.\n\n## If we fail to maintain a positiv e reputation concerning our serv ice and the content w e offer, w e may not be able to attract or retain members, w e may face regulatory scrutiny and our operating results may be adversely affected.\n\nWe believe that a positive reputation concerning our service is important in attracting and retaining members. To the extent our content is perceived as low quality, offensive or otherwise not compelling to consumers, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted. To the extent our content is deemed controversial or offensive by government regulators, we may face direct or indirect",

      "answer": "In 2023, Netflix specifically mentioned that payment processing fees paid to integrated payment partners were part of other operating costs within the cost of revenues. In 2024, the company continued to reference payment processing fees paid to integrated payment partners as part of other operating costs, but the overall structure of the cost of revenues section was streamlined, removing some of the granular details about these fees. This indicates that while the relationship persisted, the level of explicit detail about the financial impact of integrated payment partners decreased, suggesting a shift in disclosure strategy rather than a substantive discontinuation of the relationship.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, payment processing fees paid to integrated payment partners were explicitly mentioned as part of other operating costs, indicating a clear disclosure of their financial relevance.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, while the payment processing fees to integrated payment partners were still referenced, the level of detail was reduced, and the section was more generalized, suggesting a less prominent emphasis in disclosures.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a shift in how Netflix communicates its reliance on integrated payment partners \u2014 not a discontinuation of the relationship, but a reduction in the specificity of the disclosure, which could imply either internal optimization or strategic simplification of reporting."

Business\n\n## ABOUT US\n\nNetflix , Inc. ('Netflix ', 'the Company', 'registrant', 'we', or 'us') is one of the world's leading entertainment services with approx imately 302 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.\n\nOur core strategy is to grow our business globally within the parameters of our operating margin target. We strive to continuously improve our members' experience by offering compelling content that delights them and attracts new members. We aim to offer a range of pricing plans, including our ad-supported subscription plan, to meet a variety of consumer needs. We seek to drive conversation around our content to further enhance member joy, and we are continuously enhancing our user interface to help our members more easily choose content that they will find enjoyable.\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\nWe operate as one operating segment. Our revenues are primarily derived from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. See Note 12, Segment and Geographic Information , in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further detail.\n\n## COMPETITION\n\nThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete with a broad set of activities for consumers' leisure time, including other entertainment video providers, such as linear television, streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers, as well as user-generated content, some of which are by professional content creators, and more broadly against other sources of entertainment, such as social media, that our members could choose in their moments of free time. We also compete against entertainment video providers and content producers in obtaining content for our service, both for licensed content and for original content projects.\n\nWhile consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of \"winning moments of truth.\" In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, we seek to continually improve our service, including both our technology and our content offerings.\n\n## SEASONALITY\n\nOur membership growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy internet-connected screens and when they tend to increase their viewing. Historically, the fourth quarter represents our greatest streaming membership growth. In addition, our membership growth can be impacted by our content release schedule and changes to pricing and plans.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Netflix emphasized its limited experience with advertising and outlined several dependencies, particularly on third-party service providers for ad management and the need to attract and retain advertisers. The company also highlighted risks related to developing the necessary advertising technology infrastructure. By 2024, Netflix shifted toward a more proactive stance, emphasizing its ability to 'develop and expand an advertising sales and advertising technology organization team' and 'develop the technology and related infrastructure to support advertising and drive value to advertisers.' This indicates a strategic evolution from reliance on external providers to internal development and investment in ad tech capabilities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, Netflix expressed uncertainty and dependency on third-party providers for advertising technology and highlighted risks related to its limited experience and ability to attract advertisers.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, Netflix emphasized proactive development of internal advertising sales and technology teams, signaling a strategic shift toward building its own advertising infrastructure.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a transformation in Netflix\u2019s advertising technology strategy\u2014from external dependence and uncertainty in 2023 to internal development and investment in 2024."

The license periods and the terms and conditions of such rights vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions and other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certain programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our member acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\n\nMusic and certain authors' performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations ('CMOs') and similar entities that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in intellectual property (e.g., remuneration rights) in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation and negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights is likely to ex pose us to greater distribution ex penses in certain markets.\n\n## If our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark, copyright, and patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the perception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace, and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected.\n\nWe currently hold various domain names relating to our brand, including Netflix.com. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our website and our service. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\n\n## Intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our technology, business processes, and content.\n\nTrademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes, the content we produce and distribute through our service, and consumer products,",

Business\n\n## ABOUT US\n\nNetflix , Inc. ('Netflix ', 'the Company', 'registrant', 'we', or 'us') is one of the world's leading entertainment services with approx imately 302 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.\n\nOur core strategy is to grow our business globally within the parameters of our operating margin target. We strive to continuously improve our members' experience by offering compelling content that delights them and attracts new members. We aim to offer a range of pricing plans, including our ad-supported subscription plan, to meet a variety of consumer needs. We seek to drive conversation around our content to further enhance member joy, and we are continuously enhancing our user interface to help our members more easily choose content that they will find enjoyable.\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\nWe operate as one operating segment. Our revenues are primarily derived from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. See Note 12, Segment and Geographic Information , in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further detail.\n\n## COMPETITION\n\nThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete with a broad set of activities for consumers' leisure time, including other entertainment video providers, such as linear television, streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers, as well as user-generated content, some of which are by professional content creators, and more broadly against other sources of entertainment, such as social media, that our members could choose in their moments of free time. We also compete against entertainment video providers and content producers in obtaining content for our service, both for licensed content and for original content projects.\n\nWhile consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of \"winning moments of truth.\" In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, we seek to continually improve our service, including both our technology and our content offerings.\n\n## SEASONALITY\n\nOur membership growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy internet-connected screens and when they tend to increase their viewing. Historically, the fourth quarter represents our greatest streaming membership growth. In addition, our membership growth can be impacted by our content release schedule and changes to pricing and plans.",

      "question": "How has Google's financial relationship with Google Network Partners evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of the cost structure and payment obligations?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Google's cost of revenues included significant Traffic Acquisition Costs (TAC) paid to Google Network partners, primarily for ads displayed on their properties, with a noted higher cost percentage compared to Google Search properties due to the substantial share of advertiser revenues paid out as TAC. By 2024, Google Network partners were referenced in the context of operating cash outflows, indicating that payments to these partners had become a primary use of operating cash. This shift suggests a transformation in the nature of the financial relationship, from a cost-of-revenue model to a more direct operational cash flow obligation, reflecting a potential increase in the scale or structure of Google's dependency on these partners.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Google Network partners were primarily referenced in the cost of revenues section, with TAC being a major component, indicating a cost-based relationship tied to ad placements.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, Google Network partners were referenced in the context of cash outflows from operating activities, suggesting a shift toward a more direct financial commitment or increased scale of payments.",
        "Step 3: The change from a cost-based categorization in 2022 to a cash flow-based categorization in 2024 indicates a transformation in the financial relationship with Google Network partners, likely reflecting a strategic or structural evolution in how Google engages with these partners."

Our operating expenses include costs related to R&amp;D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of these expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to the changes in revenue.\n\n## Cost of Revenues\n\nCost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n\n- TAC includes:\n- Amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution  partners  include  browser  providers,  mobile  carriers,  original  equipment  manufacturers,  and software developers.\n- Amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n- Other cost of revenues includes:\n- Content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee).\n- Expenses associated with our data centers (including bandwidth, compensation expenses, depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs) as well as other operations costs (such as content review as well as customer and product support costs).\n- Inventory and other costs related to the hardware we sell.\n\nThe cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search &amp; other properties, because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners.\n\n## Operating Expenses\n\nOperating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either R&amp;D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative.\n\nThe main components of our R&amp;D expenses are:\n\n- compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&amp;D related to our existing and new products and services;\n- depreciation; and\n- professional services fees primarily related to consulting and outsourcing services.\n\nThe main components of our sales and marketing expenses are:\n\n- compensation  expenses  for  employees  engaged  in  sales  and  marketing,  sales  support,  and  certain  customer service functions; and\n- spending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services.\n\nThe main components of our general and administrative expenses are:\n\n- compensation  expenses  for  employees  in  finance,  human  resources,  information  technology,  legal,  and  other administrative support functions;\n- expenses related to legal matters, including fines and settlements; and\n- professional services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and outsourcing services.",

In Google Serv ices, we also generate cash through consumer subscriptions, the sale of apps and in-app purchases, and devices. In Google Cloud, we generate cash through consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, applications, and other cloud serv ices.\n\nOur primary uses of cash from operating activ ities include payments to distribution and Google Network partners, to employees for compensation, and to content prov iders. Other uses of cash from operating activ ities include payments to suppliers for dev ices, to tax authorities for income taxes, and other general corporate expenditures.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activ ities increased from 2023 to 2024 due to an increase in cash receiv ed from customers, partially offset by an increase in cash payments for cost of rev enues and operating expenses.\n\n## Cash Used in Investing Activities\n\nCash provided by inv esting activ ities consists primarily of maturities and sales of inv estments in marketable and non-marketable securities. Cash used in  inv esting  activ ities  consists  primarily  of  purchases  of  marketable  and  non-marketable  securities,  purchases  of  property  and  equipment,  and payments for acquisitions.\n\nNet  cash  used  in  inv esting  activ ities  increased  from  2023  to  2024  primarily  due  to  an  increase  in  purchases  of  property  and  equipment  and purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by increases in maturities and sales of marketable securities. T he increase in purchases of property and equipment is primarily driv en by inv estments in technical infrastructure.\n\n## Cash Used in Financing Activities\n\nCash provided by financing activ ities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from the sale of interests in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activ ities consists primarily of repurchases of stock, net payments related to stock-based award activ ities, payment of div idends, and repayments of debt.\n\nNet  cash  used  in  financing  activ ities  increased  from  2023  to  2024  due  to  div idend  payments  and  net  payments  related  to  stock-based  award activ ities, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from issuance of debt, net of repayments.",

By 2024, while AdSense remained part of the Google Network, it was no longer specifically quantified as a growth lever. Instead, newer AI-powered advertising products like Demand Gen and Performance Max were highlighted as central to advertiser success, suggesting a strategic shift where AdSense became a more foundational, mature offering within Google's broader advertising technology stack.",

        "The shift from AdSense being a highlighted growth contributor in 2022 to a less prominent role in 2024, while newer AI-based products are emphasized, indicates a strategic evolution where AdSense has matured and become more foundational within the ecosystem."

T hat is why we continue to inv est in platforms like our Android mobile operating system, Chrome browser, and Chrome operating system, as well as our family of dev ices. We see tremendous potential for dev ices to be helpful and make people's liv es easier by combining the best of our AI, software, and hardware. This potential is reflected in our latest generation of devices, such as the new Pixel 9 series and the Pixel Watch 3. Creating products and serv ices that people rely on ev ery day is a journey that we are inv esting in for the long-term.\n\n## How We Make Money\n\nWe  have  built  world-class  adv ertising  technologies  for  adv ertisers,  agencies,  and  publishers  to  power  their  digital  marketing  businesses.  Our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses through our wide range of products across dev ices and formats, and we aim to ensure positiv e user experiences by serv ing the right ads at the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies. AI has been foundational to our adv ertising business for more than a decade. Products like Demand Gen, Performance Max, and Product Studio use the full power of our AI to help adv ertisers find untapped and incremental conv ersion opportunities.\n\nGoogle  Serv ices  generates  rev enues  primarily  by  deliv ering  both  performance  and  brand  adv ertising  that  appears  on  Google  Search  &amp;  other properties,  YouT ube,  and  Google  Network  partners'  properties  (\"Google  Network  properties\").  We  continue  to  inv est  in  both  performance  and  brand advertising and seek to improv e the measurability of adv ertising so adv ertisers understand the effectiv eness of their campaigns.\n\n- Performance advertising creates and deliv ers relev ant ads that users will click on leading to direct engagement with adv ertisers. Performance advertising lets our adv ertisers connect with users while driv ing measurable results. Our ads tools allow performance adv ertisers to create simple text-based ads.\n- Brand advertising helps  enhance  users'  awareness of  and  affinity  for  adv ertisers'  products  and  serv ices,  through  v ideos,  text,  images,  and other  interactiv e  ads  that  run  across  v arious  dev ices.  We  help  brand  adv ertisers  deliv er  digital  v ideos  and  other  types  of  ads  to  specific audiences for their brand-building marketing campaigns.\n\nWe have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad adv ertising practices and protecting users on the web. We focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and adv ertisers in many ways, including filtering out inv alid traffic, remov ing billions of bad ads from our systems every year, and closely monitoring the sites, apps, and v ideos where ads appear and blocklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content.\n\nIn addition, Google Serv ices increasingly generates rev enues from products and serv ices beyond adv ertising, including:\n\n- consumer subscriptions, which primarily include rev enues from YouTube serv ices, such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;\n- platforms , which primarily include rev enues from Google Play sales of apps and in-app purchases; and\n- devices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of dev ices.\n\n## Google Cloud\n\nThrough our Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace offerings, Google Cloud generates rev enues primarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, applications, and other cloud serv ices. Customers use Google Cloud in multiple ways such as:\n\n- AI-optimized Infrastructure: prov ides  open,  reliable,  and  scalable  compute,  networking, and storage to enable customers to run workloads anywhere - on our Cloud, at the edge, or in their data centers. It can be used to migrate and modernize IT systems and to train and serv e various types of AI models.\n- Developer Platform: prov ides dev elopers, through the Vertex AI platform, the ability to train, tune, augment, test, and deploy applications using Gemini and other leading generativ e AI models. We offer widely used first-party, third-party, and open models along with serv ices such as v ector search, grounding, and distillation to further improv e the cost and quality of models.\n- Cybersecurity: prov ides  AI  powered  cybersecurity  solutions  to  help  customers  analyze,  detect,  protect,  and  respond  to  a  broad  range  of cybersecurity  threats,  to  further  strengthen  security  outcomes,  prioritize  which  threats  to  inv estigate,  and  identify  attack  paths,  as  well  as accelerate resolution of cybersecurity threats.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Google highlighted that an evolving foreign policy landscape could subject the company to 'new regulatory costs and challenges,' specifically mentioning data transfers between the EU and the UK, as well as new customer requirements. By 2024, the scope of regulatory challenges expanded significantly. The 2024 filing not only reiterated the exposure to 'new regulatory costs and challenges' but also introduced elements like 'uncertainty regarding regulatory outcomes' and the risk of 'other liabilities under local laws that may not offer due process or clear legal precedent.' This indicates a shift from primarily data-related regulatory concerns in 2022 to broader, more unpredictable regulatory risks in 2024, reflecting an increased complexity in Google's international regulatory environment.",

        "Step 1: Identify the scope and nature of regulatory cost risks in 2022, specifically referencing data transfers and customer requirements.",

Sometimes,  these  issues  may  be  caused  by  components  we  purchase  from  other  manufacturers  or suppliers. If the quality of our products and services does not meet expectations or our products or services are defective, it could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nWe require our suppliers and business partners to comply with laws and, where applicable, our company policies, such  as  the  Google  Supplier  Code  of  Conduct,  regarding  workplace  and  employment  practices,  data  security, environmental compliance, and intellectual property licensing, but we do not control them or their practices. Violations of law or unethical business practices could result in supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, harm to key relationships, and damage to our reputation. Their failure  to  procure  necessary  license  rights  to  intellectual  property  could  affect  our ability to sell our products or services and expose us to litigation or financial claims.\n\nInterruption  to,  interference  with,  or  failure  of  our  complex  information  technology  and  communications systems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services, which could harm our reputation, financial  condition,  and  operating  results.  In  addition,  problems  with  the  design  or  implementation  of  our  new global enterprise resource planning system could harm our business and operations.\n\nThe  availability  of  our  products  and  services  and  fulfillment  of  our  customer  contracts  depend  on  the  continuing operation  of  our  information  technology  and  communications  systems.  Our  systems  are  vulnerable  to  damage, interference, or interruption from modifications or upgrades, terrorist attacks, natural disasters or pandemics, the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutoffs  associated  with  wildfire  prevention,  and  increased  storm  severity),  power  loss,  telecommunications  failures, computer viruses, ransomware attacks, computer denial of service attacks, phishing schemes, or other attempts to harm or access our systems. Some of our data centers are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes or other natural disasters. Our data centers are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism, and, in some cases, to  potential  disruptions  resulting  from  problems  experienced  by  facility  operators.  Some  of  our  systems  are  not  fully redundant, and disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The occurrence of a natural disaster or pandemic,  closure  of  a  facility,  or  other  unanticipated  problems  affecting  our  data  centers  could  result  in  lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, our products and services are highly technical and complex and have contained in the  past,  and  may  contain  in  the  future,  errors  or  vulnerabilities,  which  could  result  in  interruptions  in  or  failure  of  our services or systems.\n\nIn  addition,  we  rely  extensively  on  information  systems  and  technology  to  manage  our  business  and  summarize operating  results.  We  are  in  the  process  of  a  multi-year  implementation  of  a  new  ERP  system,  which  is  designed  to accurately  maintain  our  financial  records,  enhance  the  flow  of  financial  information,  improve  data  management,  and provide timely information to our management team. As the phased implementation continues, we may experience delays, increased costs, and other difficulties.  Failure  to  successfully  design  and  implement  the  ERP  system  as  planned  could harm  our  business,  financial  condition,  and  operating  results. Additionally,  if  we  do  not  effectively  implement  the  ERP system as planned or the ERP system does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be negatively affected.\n\nOur  international  operations  expose  us  to  additional  risks  that  could  harm  our  business,  our  financial condition, and operating results.\n\nOur  international  operations  are  significant  to  our  revenues  and  net  income,  and  we  plan  to  continue  to  grow internationally.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Alphabet Inc.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\n\n## Basis of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nPreparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  GAAP  requires  us  to  make  estimates  and assumptions  that  affect  the  amounts  reported  and  disclosed  in  the  financial  statements  and  the  accompanying  notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties, including the effects of COVID-19. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; fair values of financial instruments, intangible assets, and goodwill; useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment; income taxes; and contingent liabilities, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\n\nIn  January  2021,  we  completed  an  assessment  of  the  useful  lives  of  our  servers  and  network  equipment  and adjusted the estimated useful life  of  our  servers  from  three  years  to  four  years  and  the  estimated  useful  life  of  certain network equipment from three years to five years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal year 2021. Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 2020 and those acquired during the year ended December 31, 2021, the effect of this change in estimate was a reduction in depreciation expense of $2.6 billion and an increase in net income of $2.0 billion, or $3.02 per basic share and $2.98 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, and the collectibility  of  an  amount  that  we  expect  in  exchange  for  those  goods  or  services  is  probable.  Sales  and  other  similar taxes are excluded from revenues.\n\n## Advertising Revenues\n\nWe generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on:\n\n- Google Search and other properties, including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use  Google.com  as  their  default  search  in  browsers,  toolbars,  etc.  and  other  Google  owned  and  operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n- YouTube properties; and\n- Google Network properties, including revenues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\n\nOur  customers  generally  purchase  advertising  inventory  through  Google  Ads,  Google  Ad  Manager,  and  Google Marketing Platform, among others.\n\nWe offer advertising by delivering both performance and brand advertising. We recognize revenues for performance advertising when a user engages with the advertisement, such as a click, a view, or a purchase. For brand advertising, we recognize revenues when the ad is displayed, or a user views the ad.\n\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed on Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues, and amounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing.",

      "question": "How has the role of Google Play in generating non-advertising revenue evolved between 2022 and 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Google Play was introduced as part of the company's broader strategy to expand non-advertising revenues, specifically through the sales of apps, in-app purchases, and digital content. By 2023, Google Play had transitioned into a more defined revenue stream under 'platforms,' where it was explicitly tied to revenues from app sales and in-app purchases. This evolution indicates a strategic shift toward solidifying Google Play\u2019s role as a key monetization platform rather than just a component of diversification. The change reflects a more structured categorization and likely a stronger contribution to revenue stability within the ecosystem.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nInternational  revenues  represent  a  significant  portion  of  our  revenues  and  are  subject  to  fluctuations  in  foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings.\n\n## \u00b7 The portion of revenues that we derive from non-advertising revenues is increasing and may adversely affect margins.\n\nNon-advertising revenues have grown over time. We expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our offerings through products and services like Google Cloud, Google Play, hardware products, and YouTube subscriptions. We currently derive non-advertising revenues primarily from sales of apps and in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud services and subscription and other services. A number of Other Bets initiatives are in their initial development stages, and as such, revenues from these businesses could be volatile.  In  addition,  the  margins  on  these  revenues  vary  significantly  and  may  be  lower  than  the margins on our advertising revenues.\n\n## \u00b7 As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and capital expenditures.\n\nWe continue to make significant R&amp;D investments in areas of strategic focus across Google Services, Google Cloud and Other Bets. We also expect to continue to invest in land and buildings for data centers and offices, and information technology assets, which includes servers and network equipment, to support the long-term growth of our business. In addition, acquisitions and strategic investments contribute to the breadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in  engineering  and  other  functional  areas,  and  build  strong  partnerships  around  strategic  initiatives.  For  example,  in January 2021 we closed the acquisition of Fitbit, Inc. for $2.1 billion, which is expected to help spur innovation in wearable devices.\n\n## \u00b7 We face continuing changes in regulatory conditions, laws, and public policies, which could affect our business practices and financial results.\n\nChanges in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range of topics and related legal matters have resulted in fines and caused us to change our business practices. As these global trends continue, our cost of doing business may increase, and our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products or services may be limited. Examples include the antitrust complaints filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and a  number  of  state Attorneys  General,  the  Digital  Markets Act  in  Europe,  and  various  legislative  proposals  in  the  U.S. focused on large technology platforms.\n\n## \u00b7 Our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them.\n\nOur employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. We expect to continue hiring talented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs. For additional information see Culture and Workforce in Part I, Item 1 'Business.'\n\n## Seasonality and other\n\nOur  advertising  revenues  are  affected  by  seasonal  fluctuations  in  internet  usage,  advertising  expenditures,  and underlying  business  trends,  such  as  traditional  retail  seasonality.  Additionally,  our  non-advertising  revenues,  including those  generated  from  Google  Cloud,  Google  Play,  hardware,  and  YouTube,  may  be  affected  by  fluctuations  driven  by changes in pricing, digital content releases, fee structures, new product and service launches, other market dynamics, as well as seasonality.\n\n## Revenues and Monetization Metrics\n\n## Google Services\n\nGoogle Services revenues consist of revenues generated from advertising ('Google advertising') as well as revenues from other sources ('Google other revenues').\n\n## Google Advertising\n\nGoogle advertising revenues are comprised of the following:\n\n- Google Search &amp; other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n- YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and",

      "answer": "In 2022, Google Ad Manager was explicitly cited as one of the key drivers behind the $8.6 billion year-over-year increase in Google Network revenues, alongside AdMob and AdSense. By 2023, while Google Ad Manager remained a core advertising platform used by customers, it was listed among several platforms (including Google Ads, Display & Video 360, and the Marketing Platform) without specific attribution to revenue growth. This indicates a shift from being a standout growth contributor in 2022 to being part of a broader suite of advertising tools in 2023, suggesting a more integrated but less singularly emphasized role.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Google Play was specifically mentioned as generating revenues from 'sales of apps and in-app purchases and digital content sold in the Google Play store.' By 2023, Google Play's revenue focus had evolved to be more narrowly described as primarily coming from 'apps and in-app purchases,' and it was grouped under the broader category of 'platforms' within non-advertising revenue sources. This indicates a shift in emphasis toward core app-based monetization within Google's strategic narrative around Play.",

We see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful and make people's lives easier by combining the best of our AI, software and hardware. This potential is reflected in our latest generation of hardware products such as Pixel 5a 5G and Pixel 6 phones, the Fitbit Charge 5, Chromecast with Google TV, and the new Google Nest Cams and Nest Doorbell. Creating products that people rely on every day is a journey that we are investing in for the long run.\n\nThe key to building helpful products for users is our commitment to privacy, security, and user choice. We protect user privacy and security with products that are secure by default and private by design, and that keep users in control of their data.  Our  privacy-preserving  technologies  safeguard  individual  privacy  and  enhance  data  protection.  As  the  Internet evolves, so does our approach to privacy and security. We continue to enhance our anti-malware features in Chrome and drive improvements such as auto-delete controls that automatically delete web and app searches after 18 months. And we continue to keep users and their passwords safe through advances like our built-in password manager.\n\n## How we make money\n\nWe have built  world-class  advertising  technologies  for  advertisers,  agencies,  and  publishers  to  power  their  digital marketing businesses. Our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses through our wide range of products across devices and formats, and we aim to ensure positive user experiences by serving the right ads at the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies.\n\nGoogle Services generates revenues primarily by delivering both performance and brand advertising that appears on Google Search &amp; other properties, YouTube and Google Network partners' properties (\"Google Network properties\"). We continue  to  invest  in  both  performance  and  brand  advertising  and  seek  to  improve  the  measurability  of  advertising  so advertisers understand the effectiveness of their campaigns.\n\n- Performance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click on, leading to direct engagement with advertisers. Performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving measurable results. Our ads tools allow performance advertisers to create simple text-based ads.\n- Brand advertising helps enhance users' awareness of and affinity for advertisers' products and services, through videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across various devices. We help brand advertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brand-building marketing campaigns.\n\nWe have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web. We focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways, including filtering out invalid traffic, removing billions of bad ads from our systems every year, and closely monitoring the sites, apps, and videos where ads appear and blocklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content.\n\nWe continue to look to the future and are making long-term investments that we expect to grow revenues beyond advertising, including revenues from Google Play, hardware, and YouTube non-advertising.\n\n- Google Play generates revenues from sales of apps and in-app purchases and digital content sold in the Google Play store.\n- Hardware generates revenues from sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, Pixel phones, and other devices.\n- YouTube non-advertising generates revenues from YouTube Premium and YouTube TV subscriptions and other services.\n\n## Google Cloud\n\nGoogle  was  a  company  built  in  the  cloud.  We  continue  to  invest  in  infrastructure,  security,  data  management, analytics,  and  AI.  We  see  significant  opportunity  in  helping  businesses  utilize  these  strengths  with  features  like  data migration,  modern  development  environments,  and  machine  learning  tools  to  provide  enterprise-ready  cloud  services, including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace. Google Cloud Platform enables developers to build, test, and deploy  applications  on  its  highly  scalable  and  reliable  infrastructure.  Google  Workspace  collaboration  tools  -  which include apps like Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, Meet and more - are designed with real-time collaboration and machine intelligence  to  help  people  work  smarter.  Because  more  and  more  of  today's  digital  experiences  are  being  built  in  the cloud, Google Cloud products help businesses of all sizes take advantage of the latest technology advances to operate more efficiently.\n\n- Google Cloud Platform generates revenues from infrastructure, platform and other services.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Comcast had a Fourth Amended and Restated Shareholders Agreement with Atairos Group, Inc., which was further amended in June 2023. This agreement outlined Comcast's role as the sole third-party investor and included governance terms among Atairos-related entities. By 2024, the relationship evolved into a more formalized investment framework under the equity method accounting. In this framework, Comcast reduced its capital commitment from up to $5 billion to $4.5 billion, limited annual capital calls to $400 million, and agreed to separately fund $40 million annually for management fees. Additionally, the 2024 filing clarified that Comcast absorbs approximately 99% of Atairos\u2019 losses and receives approximately 86% of residual returns, while Atairos\u2019 management companies (led by Comcast\u2019s former CFO) retained all voting rights. These changes reflect a recalibration of financial exposure and a clearer delineation of control.",

Equity method investments are recorded at cost and are adjusted to recognize (1) our share, based on percentage ownership or other contractual basis, of the investee's net income or loss after the date of investment, (2) amortization of the recorded investment that exceeds our share of the book value of the investee's net assets, (3) additional contributions made and dividends or other distributions received, and (4) impairments resulting from other-than-temporary declines in fair value. For some investments, we record our share of the investee's net income or loss one quarter in arrears due to the timing of our receipt of such information. G ains or losses on the sale of equity method investments are recorded to other income (loss), net. If an equity method investee were to issue additional securities that would change our proportionate share of the entity, we would recognize the change, if any, as a gain or loss to oth er income (loss), net. Cash distributions received from equity method investments are considered returns on investment and are presented within operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows to the extent of cumulative equity in net income of the investee. Additional distributions are presented as investing activities. Distributions presented within operating activities totaled $297 million, $217 million and $162 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Atairos\n\nOn January 1, 2016, we established Atairos G roup, Inc., a strategic company focused on investing in and operating companies in a range of industries and business sectors, both domestically and internationally. Atairos is controlled by management companies led by our former CFO through interests that carry all of the voting rights. We are the only third-party investor in Atairos.\n\nIn November 2020, we amended our agreement with Atairos, which primarily extended the investment term of the agreement from up to 12 years to up to 16.5 years, extended the period in which capital can be recycled to the full investment period and decreased our commitment to fund Atairos from up to $5 billion to up to $4.5 billion in the aggregate at any one time, subject to certain offsets, with the max imum amount of annual capital calls reduced to $400 million, plus certain amounts previously distributed. In addition, we have separately committed to fund Atairos $40 million annually for a management fee, subject to certain adjustments. The management company investors have committed to fund from $50 million to $100 million, with at least $40 million to be funded by our former CFO, subject to his continued role with Atairos. Our economic interests do not carry voting rights and obligate us to absorb approximately 99% of any losses and they provide us the right to receive approximately 86% of any residual returns in Atairos, in either case on a cumulative basis.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "answer": "In 2023, Comcast specifically noted an increase in capital expenditures directly related to the development of Epic Universe in Orlando, with a total of $8.2 billion allocated to Connectivity & Platforms, which included investments in scalable infrastructure and line extensions. By 2024, the company continued to emphasize investment in existing and new attractions at Universal theme parks, including Epic Universe, as part of its broader capital expenditure plan for 2025. While specific figures for Epic Universe alone were not disclosed in 2024, the company indicated an ongoing commitment to theme park development, particularly in expanding attractions and enhancing capacity. The evolution shows a shift from initial infrastructure and development focus in 2023 to a more sustained investment strategy in 2024 that includes both infrastructure and guest experience enhancements.",

In addition, we expect to continue investment in existing and new attractions at our Universal theme parks, including Epic Universe. Capital expenditures for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors, including competition, changes in technology, regulatory changes, the timing and rate of deployment of new services, the capacity required for existing services, the timing of new attractions at our theme parks and potential acquisitions.\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nNet  cash  used  in  financing  activities  decreased  in  2024  primarily  due  to  repayment  of  a  collateralized  obligation  in  the  prior  year  (see  Note  7),  a  decrease  in repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program and employee plans, lower repurchases and repayments of debt in the current year, repayments of short-term borrowings, net in the prior year and higher proceeds from borrowings in the current year.\n\nIn September 2024, we issued \u20ac1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate euro senior notes maturing in 2032 and 2036 and entered into a corresponding cross-currency swap, effectively converting the debt to an aggregate U.S. dollar principal amount of $2.0 billion with a weighted-average interest rate of 4.72%. We also issued \u00a3750 million ($1.0 billion using ex change rates on the date of issuance) principal amount of fix ed rate sterling senior notes maturing in 2040 with an interest rate of 5.25%. The net proceeds from this issuance were intended for working capital and general corporate purposes, including the early redemption of $725 million of  our  outstanding  5.25%  Notes  due  2025,  which  was  completed  in  October  2024,  and  the  repayment  of  certain  of  our  other  outstanding  debt  with  near-term maturities. In May 2024, we issued $3.3 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate senior notes, which have maturities ranging between 2029 and 2054 and a weighted-average interest rate of 5.38%. The net proceeds from this issuance were used for the repayment of our outstanding commercial paper, and for working capital and general corporate purposes.\n\nIn 2024, we made debt repayments of $3.6 billion, including $1.9 billion principal amount of notes due at maturity and $750 million of 5.250% Notes due 2025, $391 million of 3.950% Notes due 2025, $256 million of 3.375% Notes due 2025, and $104 million of 3.150% Notes due 2026.\n\nWe have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. Any such repurchases may be effected through privately negotiated transactions, market transactions, tender offers, redemptions or otherwise. In particular, we may repurchase varying amounts of our outstanding public notes and debentures with short to medium term maturities through privately negotiated or market transactions. See Notes 6 and 7 for additional information on our financing activities.\n\n## Share Repurchases and Dividends\n\nIn the second quarter of 2021, we restarted our share repurchase program, which had been paused since the beginning of 2019. In January 2024, our Board of Directors terminated our existing program and approved a new share repurchase program authorization of $15 billion effective as of January 26, 2024, which had no expiration date. In 2024, we repurchased a total of 212 million shares of our Class A common stock for $8.6 billion under our authorization programs. We did not purchase any shares outside of these programs. As of December 31, 2024, we had $7.0 billion remaining under the authorization, and in January 2025, our Board of Directors terminated the existing program and approved a new share repurchase program authorization of $15 billion, which has no expiration date. We expect to repurchase additional shares of our Class A common stock under this new authorization in the open market or in private transactions, subject to market and other conditions.\n\nIn 2024, our Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends of $0.31 per share, including our fourth quarter dividend payable in January 2025 and we made dividend payments of $4.8 billion. In January 2025, our Board of Directors approved a 6.5% increase in our dividend to $1.32 per share on an annualized basis and approved our first quarter dividend of $0.33 per share, to be paid in April 2025. We ex pect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "question": "How has the nature of CMCSA's relationship with local broadcast television stations evolved from 2023 to 2024, particularly in terms of competitive positioning and dependency for content distribution?",
      "answer": "In 2023, CMCSA's Media segment directly competed with local broadcast television stations for viewers' attention and advertising revenue. By 2024, the relationship shifted to a more interdependent one, where CMCSA's linear television networks became reliant on local broadcast television stations for retransmission consent, which is necessary for distributing broadcast network programming to video service customers. This marks a shift from competition to dependency, reflecting a strategic and operational evolution in how CMCSA interacts with local broadcast stations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, CMCSA's Media segment competed directly with local broadcast television stations for audience share and advertising dollars, as stated in the 'Competition' section under 'Media'.",
        "Step 2: By 2024, CMCSA's broadcast networks depended on affiliation agreements and retransmission consent from local broadcast stations to ensure programming reach, indicating a shift to reliance on these stations for distribution.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a transformation in the relationship from competition to dependency, likely influenced by evolving media distribution models and industry consolidation."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe also create content for licensing to third parties and to our linear television networks or Peacock. The inability to license such content on acceptable terms or at all could negatively impact our business. Moreover, we may generate lower revenue when we opt to retain our content for our own use, including for Peacock, rather than licensing it to third parties who pay licensing fees for such content.\n\nIf  our  content  does  not  achieve  sufficient  consumer  acceptance,  or  if  we  cannot  obtain  or  retain  rights  to  popular  content  on  acceptable  terms,  or  at  all,  our businesses may be adversely affected.\n\n## Programming expenses for our video services are increasing on a per subscriber basis, which could adversely affect our video businesses.\n\nWe expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to be the largest single expense item for our Residential Connectivity &amp; Platforms business and to continue to increase on a per subscriber basis. Part of these programming expenses include payments to certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to video services customers; we expect to continue to be subject to demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations. These market factors may be exacerbated by consolidation in the media industry, which may further  increase  our  programming  ex penses.  If  we  are  unable  to  offset  programming  cost  increases  through  rate  increases,  the  sale  of  additional  services,  cost management or other initiatives, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\nMoreover, as our contracts with programming providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms, or at all, in which case we may be unable to provide such programming as part of our video services, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\n## The loss of programming distribution agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect our businesses.\n\nOur linear television networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain distribution agreements with traditional and virtual multichannel video providers. The number of subscribers to our television networks has been, and likely will continue to be, reduced as a result of fewer subscribers to multichannel video providers as the media distribution business model changes. Similarly, multichannel video providers may elect not to enter into agreements to distribute some or all of our linear television networks as a result of these changing market dynamics. In addition, our broadcast television networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain network affiliation agreements with third-party local broadcast television stations in the markets where we do not own the affiliated local broadcast television station. Our owned local broadcast television stations must elect, with respect to retransmission by certain multichannel video providers, either 'must-carry' status, in which we require the provider to carry the station without paying any compensation to us, or 'retransmission consent,' in which we give up our right to mandatory carriage and instead seek to negotiate the terms and conditions of carriage, including the amount of compensation, if any, paid to us by such provider.\n\nFor all of these types of arrangements, our ability to renew agreements on acceptable terms may be affected by evolving market dynamics and industry consolidation. There can be no assurance that any of these agreements will be entered into or renewed in the future on similar terms. The inability to enter into or renew some or all of these agreements could reduce our revenues and the reach of our programming, which could adversely affect our businesses.\n\n## Our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of others.\n\nWe rely on our intellectual property, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other third parties, to use various technologies, conduct our business operations and sell our products and services. Legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or other violation by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability, or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question, from importing into the United States or other jurisdictions in which we operate hardware or software that uses such intellectual property or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted. We may need to change our business practices if any of these events occur, which may limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming, costly to defend and may divert management's attention and resources away from our businesses. Moreover, if we are unable to obtain, or continue to obtain, licenses from our vendors and other third parties on reasonable terms, or at all, our businesses could be adversely affected.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\nWhile a portion of our customers are subject to contracts for their services, which are typically 1 month to 2 years in length, based on our evaluation of the terms of these contracts, we recognize revenue for these services primarily on a basis that is consistent with our customers that are not subject to contracts and recognize revenue as the services are provided on a monthly basis. Installation fees for these customers are deferred and recognized as revenue over the period of benefit to the  customer,  which  is  less  than  a  year.  Certain  international  customers  are  under  contracts,  with  terms  typically  ranging  from  rolling  monthly  to  24  months, depending on the service, and may only discontinue service in accordance with the terms of their contracts. We recognize revenue for these customers as the services are provided over the contract period. At any given time, the amount of future revenue to be earned from these customers related to existing agreements is equal  to  less  than 10%  of  our  annual  Residential  Connectivity  &amp;  Platforms  revenue  and  will  generally  be  recognized  within 24  months.  Sales  commissions  are generally expensed as incurred, as the related period of benefit is less than a year. Sales commissions for the international customers under contract are generally deferred and recognized over the respective contract terms.\n\nOur services generally involve customer premise equipment, such as wireless gateways and set-top boxes, that are generally considered part of our services for revenue recognition. We recognize revenue from the sale of devices, including wireless devices and Sky G lass smart televisions, when they are transferred to the customer. Under an equipment installment plan, customers typically have the option to finance wireless devices and Sky G lass smart televisions interest-free over 24 months, and up to 48 months for international customers. Equipment installment plan receivables under these arrangements are recorded net of imputed interest when the devices are transferred to the customer.\n\nWe also have arrangements to sell certain DTC streaming services to our customers. We have concluded we are the sales agent in these arrangements, and we record net commission revenue as earned, which is generally as customers are billed on a monthly basis, within domestic broadband and international connectivity revenue.\n\nUnder the terms of our domestic cable franchise agreements, we are generally required to pay the cable franchising authority an amount based on gross video revenue. We generally pass these and other similar fees through to our domestic customers and classify these fees in the respective Residential Connectivity &amp; Platforms services revenue, with the corresponding costs included in other operating and administrative expenses.\n\n## Advertising\n\nRevenue is generated from the sale of advertising and technology, tools and solutions relating to advertising businesses. As part of distribution agreements with domestic cable networks, we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time that we sell to advertisers. In addition, we generate revenue from the sale of advertising on our owned Sky-branded entertainment television networks and our digital platforms. In most cases, the available advertising units are sold by our sales force. We also enter into representation agreements under which we sell advertising on behalf of third parties. Since we are acting as the principal in these arrangements, we record the advertising that is sold in advertising revenue and the fees paid to the third parties in other operating and administrative expenses. In some cases, we work with representation firms as an extension of our sales force to sell a portion of the advertising units allocated to us and record the revenue net of agency commissions.\n\nWe have determined that a contract exists for our advertising sales arrangements once all terms and conditions are agreed upon, typically when the number of advertising units is specifically identified and scheduled. Advertisements are generally aired or delivered within one year once all terms and conditions are agreed upon. Revenue from these arrangements is recognized in the period in which advertisements are aired or delivered. Payment terms vary by contract, although terms generally  require  payment  within 30  to 60  days  from  when  advertisements  are  aired  or  delivered.  We  also  provide  technology,  tools,  data-driven  services  and marketplace solutions to customers in the media industry to facilitate the more effective engagement of advertisers with their target audiences and recognize revenue when these services are provided.\n\n## Business Services Connectivity Segment\n\nBusiness Services Connectivity generates revenue from subscribers to a variety of our products and services which are offered to businesses. Our connectivity service offerings for small business locations in the United States primarily include broadband, wireline voice and wireless services that are similar to those provided to our residential customers and include certain other features specific to businesses. Our enterprise solutions offerings for medium-sized customers and larger enterprises also include ethernet network services, advanced voice services and a software-defined networking product. We also have certain business connectivity service offerings in the United Kingdom.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "question": "How has Comcast's involvement with Universal Beijing Resort evolved from 2023 to 2024 in terms of debt levels, ownership structure, and financial risk exposure?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Universal Beijing Resort had $3.5 billion of debt outstanding, including a $3.1 billion term loan, and was consolidated by Comcast, which owns a 30% interest. By 2024, the debt level slightly decreased to $3.4 billion, with the term loan principal reducing to $3.0 billion. Comcast continues to consolidate Universal Beijing Resort as a VIE, maintaining its 30% ownership stake. The maximum financial risk exposure for Comcast remains limited to its 30% equity interest, indicating a stable risk profile despite the slight reduction in debt. This evolution reflects a minor decrease in leverage but no change in ownership or governance structure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 (2023): Universal Beijing Resort had $3.5 billion in debt, including a $3.1 billion term loan, and Comcast owned 30% and consolidated the entity.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 (2024): Universal Beijing Resort had $3.4 billion in debt, including a $3.0 billion term loan, and Comcast still owns 30% and consolidates the entity.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change: Debt levels slightly decreased, but ownership and consolidation status remained unchanged, indicating a minor reduction in financial leverage but stable exposure."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\n## Nonmarketable Equity Securities\n\nWe classify  investments  without  readily  determinable  fair  values  that  are  not  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  as  nonmarketable  equity  securities.  The accounting guidance requires nonmarketable equity securities to be recorded at cost and adjusted to fair value at each reporting period. However, the guidance allows for a measurement alternative, which is to record the investments at cost, less impairment, if any, and subsequently adjust for observable price changes of identical or similar investments of the same issuer.  We generally apply the measurement alternative, adjusting the investments for observable price changes of identical or similar investments of the same issuer, to our nonmarketable equity securities. When an observable event occurs, we estimate the fair values of our nonmarketable equity securities primarily based on Level 2 inputs that are derived from observable price changes of similar securities adjusted for insignificant differences in rights and obligations. The changes in value are recorded in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net.\n\n## Other Investments\n\nOther investments also includes certain short-term instruments with maturities over three months when purchased, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit and U.S. government obligations, that are generally accounted for at amortized cost. We had no short-term instruments as of December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, these short-term instruments totaled $254 million. The carrying amounts of these investments approximate their fair values, which are primarily based on Level 2 inputs  that  use  interest  rates  for  instruments  with  similar  terms  and  remaining  maturities.  Proceeds  from  short-term  instruments  in  2024,  2023  and 2022  were $702 million, $560 million and $1.6 billion, respectively. Purchases of short-term instruments in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $443 million, $506 million and $1.8 billion, respectively.\n\n## Impairment Testing of Investments\n\nWe  review  our  investment  portfolio,  other  than  our  marketable  equity  securities,  each  reporting  period  to  determine  whether  there  are  identified  events  or circumstances that would indicate there is a decline in the fair value. For our nonpublic investments, if there are no identified events or circumstances that would have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment, then the fair value is not estimated. For our equity method investments, if an investment is deemed to have experienced an other-than-temporary decline below its cost basis, we reduce the carrying amount of the investment to its quoted or estimated fair value, as applicable, and establish a new cost basis for the investment. For our nonmarketable equity securities, we record the impairment to realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. For our equity method investments, we record the impairment to other income (loss), net.\n\n## Consolidated Variable Interest Entity\n\n## Universal Beijing Resort\n\nIn 2018, we entered into an agreement with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies to build and operate a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China ('Universal  Beijing  Resort'), which opened in  September 2021.  We own a 30% interest in Universal Beijing Resort and the construction was funded through a combination of debt financing and equity contributions from the partners in accordance with their equity interests. The debt financing, which is being provided by a syndicate of Chinese financial institutions, contains certain covenants and a maximum borrowing limit of \u00a529.7 billion RMB (approximately $4.2 billion). The debt financing is secured by the assets of Universal Beijing Resort and the equity interests of the investors. As of December 31, 2024, Universal Beijing Resort had $3.4 billion of debt outstanding, including $3.0 billion principal amount of a term loan outstanding under the debt financing agreement. As of December 31, 2023, Universal Beijing Resort had $3.5 billion of debt outstanding, including $3.1 billion principal amount of a term loan outstanding under the debt financing agreement.\n\nWe have concluded that Universal Beijing Resort is a VIE based on its governance structure, and we consolidate it because we have the power to direct activities that most significantly impact its economic performance. There are no liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other financial commitments between us and Universal Beijing Resort, and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss is our 30% interest. Universal Beijing Resort's results of operations are reported in our Theme Parks segment. Our consolidated statements of cash flows includes the costs of construction and related borrowings in the 'construction of Universal Beijing Resort' and 'proceeds from borrowings' captions, respectively, and equity contributions from the noncontrolling interests are included in other financing activities.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, our consolidated balance sheets included assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort totaling $7.3 billion and $7.0 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, our consolidated balance sheets included assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort totaling $7.8 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively. The assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort primarily consist of property and equipment, operating lease assets and liabilities, and debt.",

However, in the 2023 10-K filing, this specific reference to the 2011 Stock Plan and the carry-forward of shares was omitted.

      "answer": "In 2022, the filing referenced the 'Amended and Restated Executive Severance and Retention Incentive Plan' with a filing date of September 10, 2021, indicating that the plan had undergone revisions by that date. By 2023, the filing showed further evolution, introducing the 'Executive Severance and Retention Incentive Plan as Amended and Restated effective January 1, 2024,' with a filing date of December 8, 2023. This demonstrates Netflix\u2019s ongoing adjustments to executive compensation frameworks, with a forward-looking amendment effective in 2024.",

        "Step 1: In the 2022 filing, the Executive Severance and Retention Incentive Plan was described as 'Amended and Restated' with a filing date of September 10, 2021, indicating a prior revision.",
        "Step 2: In the 2023 filing, the same plan was referenced as 'Amended and Restated effective January 1, 2024,' with a new filing date of December 8, 2023, showing a further update with a future effective date.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a continuous refinement of Netflix\u2019s executive compensation strategy, with the 2023 filing introducing a plan amendment set to take effect in the following year."

      "answer": "In 2022, Netflix was in compliance with all covenant limitations tied to its Senior Notes, which included restrictions on creating liens, entering into sale and lease-back transactions, incurring additional indebtedness by certain subsidiaries, and merging or transferring substantial assets. These notes included various euro-denominated tranches with principal amounts totaling \u20ac5,170 million. By 2024, Netflix remained in compliance with these covenants, but the scope of limitations had slightly evolved\u2014specifically, certain Senior Notes no longer referenced restrictions on sale and lease-back transactions, suggesting a narrowing of covenant scope for some notes. Additionally, in 2024, Netflix repaid $400 million of its 5.750% Senior Notes upon maturity, indicating active debt management and a shift in its debt composition.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the 2020 Stock Plan was referenced primarily through its inclusion in the exhibit list as a filed document (Def 14A, filed April 22, 2020), with no detailed description of its provisions or activities. In contrast, by 2024, the 2020 Stock Plan was not only explicitly described in detail but also linked to specific equity compensation activities, including the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, and restricted stock units (RSUs) with defined vesting schedules and performance-based criteria. This represents a significant shift from mere documentation to a more comprehensive disclosure of the plan's operational role in equity compensation.",

        "In 2022, the 2020 Stock Plan was listed in the exhibits as a filed document without elaboration on its structure or use in compensation.",
        "By 2024, the 2020 Stock Plan was described in detail, including its role in granting various types of stock awards and specific terms such as vesting periods and performance criteria.",
        "The change indicates a shift from passive documentation to active disclosure and explanation of the plan\u2019s function in the company\u2019s equity compensation strategy."

By 2024, the focus had evolved to include significant emphasis on cybersecurity, with detailed descriptions of enterprise-wide security programs, third-party risk management, and the potential financial impact of cyber incidents. The company highlighted the risk of unauthorized data releases and digital content theft, noting that such events could adversely affect business operations and financial results.

If we revise such estimates it could result in greater in-period ex penses, which could cause us to miss our earnings guidance or negatively impact the results we report which could negatively impact our stock price. Further, events outside of our control may cause actual results to differ from our forecast.\n\n## Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\n\nNone.\n\n## Item 1C. Cybersecurity\n\nWe have an enterprise-wide information security program designed to identify, protect, detect and respond to and manage reasonably foreseeable cybersecurity risks and threats. To protect our information systems from cybersecurity threats, we use various security tools that help prevent, identify, escalate, investigate, resolve and recover from identified vulnerabilities and security incidents in a timely manner. These include, but are not limited to, internal reporting, monitoring and detection tools, and a bug bounty program to allow security researchers to assist us in identifying vulnerabilities in our products before they are exploited by malicious threat actors. We also maintain a third party security program to identify, prioritize, assess, mitigate and remediate third party risks; however, we rely on the third parties we use to implement security programs commensurate with their risk, and we cannot ensure in all circumstances that their efforts will be successful.\n\nWe regularly assess risks from cybersecurity and technology threats and monitor our information systems for potential vulnerabilities. We use a widelyadopted risk quantification model to identify, measure and prioritize cybersecurity and technology risks and develop related security controls and safeguards. We conduct regular reviews and tests of our information security program and also leverage audits by our internal audit team, tabletop exercises, penetration and vulnerability testing, red team ex ercises, simulations, and other ex ercises to evaluate the effectiveness of our information security program and improve our security measures and planning. We also engage an external auditor to conduct an annual payment card industry data security standard review of our security controls protecting payment information, as well as third-party penetration testing of our cardholder environment and related systems. The results of these assessments are reported to the Audit Committee.\n\nOur systems and those of third parties with which we do business have experienced and may continue to experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of personal information (of third parties, employees, and our members) and other data, confidential information or intellectual property, and we have ex perienced unauthorized releases of certain digital content assets and unintended disclosure of personal information due to incidents related to third parties. However, to date these incidents have not had a material impact on our service, systems or business. Any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of members and adversely affect our business and results of operation. Further, a penetration of our systems or a third-party's systems or other misappropriation or misuse of personal information could subject us to business, regulatory, litigation and reputation risk, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See \"Risk Factors - Any significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized access, disclosure or destruction of data, including member and corporate information, or theft of intellectual property, including digital content assets, which could adversely impact our business.\"\n\nThe Vice President of Security and Privacy Engineering leads our global information security organization responsible for overseeing the Netflix information security program. Our VP of Security and Privacy Engineering has over 30 years of industry experience, including serving in similar roles leading and overseeing cybersecurity programs at other public companies. Team members who support our information security program have relevant educational and industry experience, including holding similar positions at large technology companies. The teams provide regular reports to senior management and other relevant teams on various cybersecurity threats, assessments and findings.\n\nThe Board oversees our annual enterprise risk assessment, where we assess key risks within the company, including security and technology risks and cybersecurity threats. The Audit Committee of the Board oversees our cybersecurity risk and receives regular reports from our VP of Security and Privacy Engineering on various cybersecurity matters, including risk assessments, mitigation strategies, areas of emerging risks, incidents and industry trends, and other areas of importance.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Netflix experienced a 19% revenue increase driven by an 11% growth in average paying memberships and a 7% rise in average monthly revenue per membership, partly due to price increases and favorable foreign exchange rates. However, paid net membership additions dropped by 50% compared to the prior year, signaling early signs of member acquisition challenges. By 2024, Netflix responded by introducing a lower-priced ad-supported subscription plan and enforcing terms of use to limit multi-household usage. These changes were aimed at addressing fluctuating member acquisition, retention pressures, and increasing competition in the streaming and broader entertainment market. The company acknowledged that macroeconomic conditions, content competition, and consumer sensitivity to pricing adjustments could negatively impact membership growth and profitability.",

The increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership resulted from our price changes and favorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Paid net membership additions for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased 50% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Our service continues to grow globally, with over 90% of the paid net membership additions for the year ended December 31, 2021 coming from outside the United States and Canada (UCAN) region.\n\nThe increase in operating margin is due primarily to content amortization growing at a slower rate as compared to the 19% increase in revenues in part as a result of delays in content releases due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict. See Item 1A: \"Risk Factors\" section set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details. While most of our productions have resumed, certain of our productions continue to experience disruption, as do the productions of our third-party content suppliers. Other partners have similarly had their operations disrupted, including those partners that we use for our operations as well as development, production and post-production of content. Production disruptions and new health and safety protocols and requirements can result in additional costs including additional pay to cast and crew and use of PPE and testing.

In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business\n\n## If our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.\n\nWe must continually add new members both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. Our ability to continue to attract and retain members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members in countries around the globe with compelling content choices that keep our members engaged with our service, effectively drive conversation around our content and service, as well as provide a quality experience for choosing and enjoying TV series, films and games. Our penetration and growth rates have fluctuated and vary across the jurisdictions where we provide our service. In countries where we have been operating for many years or where we are highly penetrated, our membership growth is slower than in newer or less penetrated countries. Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain members. Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as linear television, and streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers, as well as user-generated content, some of which are by professional content creators, and more broadly other sources of entertainment, such as social media, that our members could choose in their moments of free time.\n\nMembers cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, that they need to cut household expenses, dissatisfaction with content, a preference for competitive services and customer service issues that they believe are not satisfactorily resolved. Membership growth is also impacted by seasonality, with the fourth quarter historically representing our greatest growth, as well as the timing of our content release schedules. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, may also adversely impact our ability to attract and retain members. If we do not grow as expected, given, in particular, that our content costs are largely fix ed in nature, we may not be able to adjust our ex penditures or increase our (per membership) revenues, including by adjusting membership pricing, commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operations may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in providing compelling content, retaining our existing members and attracting new members, our business will be adversely affected.\n\n## If we do not continuously provide value to our members, including making improvements to our service in a manner that is favorably received by them, our revenue, results of operations and business will be adversely affected.\n\nIf consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existing features, adjust pricing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain members, and accordingly, our revenue and results of operations may be adversely affected. We expanded our entertainment video offering to include games and, more recently, live programming. If our efforts to sustain and improve our existing TV and film offering, as well as develop and expand our video entertainment options, are not done in a manner valued by our current and future members, our ability to attract and retain members may be negatively impacted. We may also seek to extend our business into new products and services to help drive growth. For example, we continue to expand our offering of consumer products and live experiences. To the extent we cannot successfully find and develop new products, experiences and services to help drive growth, or we do not realize the expected benefits or generate additional revenue from such new products, experiences, and services, our future results of operations and growth may be adversely impacted.\n\nWe have and may, from time to time, adjust our membership pricing, our membership plans, or our pricing model itself, including for example, the lower-priced ad-supported subscription plan. Similarly, we have increased enforcement of and will continue to enforce our terms of use to limit multi-household usage and shared viewing outside of a household. These and other adjustments we make may not be well-received by consumers, and could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain members, revenue and our results of operations. In addition, many of our members rejoin our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts to satisfy our ex isting members or adjustments to our service are not successful, we may not be able to attract or retain members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be adversely affected.\n\n## Changes in competitive offerings for entertainment video could adversely impact our business.\n\nThe market for entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. We face competition from traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers and platforms. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content, large content libraries, and significant",

      "question": "How has the structure and distribution rate of the Tower Preferred Interests evolved from 2022 to 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2022, the Tower Preferred Interests were divided into two series: the September series (Class A-1) totaling $1,500 with a 5.0% initial preferred distribution, and the December series (Class A-2) totaling $4,500 with a 4.75% initial preferred distribution. These distributions reset every five years. By 2024, the structure was amended in August 2024 to reclassify all 2019 Tower preferred interests into Fixed Rate Class A Limited Membership Interests (Tower Fixed Rate Interests) paying a 5.90% preferred distribution. Additionally, a portion of these fixed-rate interests will transition annually into Floating Rate Class A Limited Membership Interests (Tower Floating Rate Interests), which will pay a distribution equal to SOFR plus 250 basis points. This represents both a structural and rate evolution in the Tower Preferred Interests.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, the Tower Preferred Interests were split into two series with distinct dollar amounts and distribution rates (Class A-1: $1,500 at 5.0%, Class A-2: $4,500 at 4.75%).",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the structure was amended to create Fixed Rate and Floating Rate classes, with the fixed rate set at 5.90% and floating rate tied to SOFR + 250 bps, effective November 2024.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a transformation in both the structure (from two fixed series to a hybrid fixed/floating structure) and the distribution rate (increase from 5.0% and 4.75% to 5.90% for the fixed portion)."

          "chunk_text": "The membership interests in Tower Holdings consist of (1) common interests, which are held by a consolidated subsidiary of AT&amp;T, and (2) two series of preferred interests (collectively the 'Tower preferred interests'). The September series (Class A-1) of the preferred interests totals $1,500 and pays an initial preferred distribution of 5.0%, and the December series (Class A-2) totals $4,500 and pays an initial preferred distribution of 4.75%. Distributions are paid quarterly, subject to declaration, and reset every five years. Any failure to declare or pay distributions on the Tower preferred interests would not impose any limitation on cash movements between affiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&amp;T shares. We can call the Tower preferred interests at the issue price beginning five years from the issuance date or upon the receipt of proceeds from the sale of the underlying assets.\n\nThe holders of the Tower preferred interests have the option to require redemption upon the occurrence of certain contingent events, such as the failure of AT&amp;T to pay the preferred distribution for two or more periods or to meet certain other requirements, including a minimum credit rating. If notice is given upon such an event, all other holders of equal or more subordinate classes of membership interests in Tower Holdings are entitled to receive the same form of consideration payable to the holders of the preferred interests, resulting in a deemed liquidation for accounting purposes.\n\n## Telco LLC\n\nIn September 2020, we issued $2,000 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests out of a newly created limited liability company (Telco LLC) that was formed to hold telecommunication-related assets.\n\nMembers' equity in Telco LLC consist of (1) member's interests, which are held by a consolidated subsidiary of AT&amp;T, and (2) preferred interests (Telco preferred interests), which pay an initial preferred distribution of 4.25% annually, subject to declaration, and subject to reset every seven years. Failure to pay distributions on the Telco preferred interests would not limit cash movements between affiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&amp;T shares.

If notice is given, all other holders of equal or more subordinate classes of members' equity are entitled to receive the same form of consideration payable to the holders of the preferred interests, resulting in a deemed liquidation for accounting purposes.\n\n## PR Holdings\n\nIn 2019, we issued $1,950 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests in a subsidiary (PR Holdings) that held notes secured by the proceeds from our agreement to sell wireless and wireline operations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. These preferred interests were redeemed on November 6, 2020. (See Note 6)\n\nThe membership interests in PR Holdings consisted of (1) common interests, which were held by consolidated subsidiaries of AT&amp;T, and (2) preferred interests (PR preferred interests). The PR preferred interests paid an initial preferred distribution at an annual rate of 4.75%. Distributions were paid quarterly, subject to declaration.\n\n## NOTE 18. SALES OF RECEIVABLES\n\nWe have agreements with various third-party financial institutions pertaining to the sales of certain types of our accounts receivable. The most significant of these programs are discussed in detail below and generally consist of (1) receivables arising from equipment installment plans, which are sold for cash and a deferred purchase price, and (2) revolving service and trade receivables. Under these programs, we transfer receivables to purchasers in exchange for cash and additional consideration upon settlement of the receivables, where applicable. Under the terms of our agreements for these programs, we continue to bill and collect the payments from our customers on behalf of the financial institutions.\n\nThe sales of receivables did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income or to 'Total Assets' reported on our consolidated balance sheets. We reflect cash receipts on sold receivables as cash flows from operations in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Cash receipts on the deferred purchase price are classified as cash flows from investing activities.",

The liabilities associated with the Mobility preferred interests were considered Level 3 under the Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure framework (see Note 12). The difference between the carrying value of the Mobility preferred interest, which represented fair value at contribution, and the fair value of the instrument upon settlement and/or balance sheet reclassification was recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 213 million Mobility preferred interests outstanding, which had a redemption value of approximately $5,340 and paid cash distributions of $373 per annum, subject to declaration. In April 2023, we accepted the December 2022 put option notice from the AT&amp;T pension trust and repurchased the remaining 213 million Mobility preferred interests for a purchase price, including accrued and unpaid distributions, of $5,414.\n\n## Tower Holdings Preferred Interests\n\nIn 2019, we issued $6,000 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests in a wireless subsidiary (Tower Holdings) that holds interests in various tower assets and have the right to receive approximately $6,000 if the purchase options from the tower companies are exercised.\n\nThe membership interests in Tower Holdings consist of (1) common interests, which are held by a consolidated subsidiary of AT&amp;T, and (2) two series of preferred interests (collectively the '2019 Tower preferred interests'). The 2019 Tower preferred interests were subject to reset in December 2024 and included a September series (Tower Class A-1) totaling $1,500 that paid an initial preferred distribution of 5.0%, and a December series (Tower Class A-2) totaling $4,500 that paid an initial preferred distribution of 4.75%.\n\nIn August 2024, we amended the 2019 Tower preferred interests, effective November 2024, to reset the rate and restructure the membership interests whereby all of the 2019 Tower preferred interests are now designated Fixed Rate Class A Limited Membership Interests (Tower Fixed Rate Interests). A portion of the Tower Fixed Rate Interests will move to Floating Rate Class A Limited Membership Interests (Tower Floating Rate Interests) each year over a five-year period. The Tower Fixed Rate Interests pay a preferred distribution of 5.90%, and the Tower Floating Rate Interests, which could equal $525 by 2028 if not called prior, pay a preferred distribution equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus 250 basis points, as defined in the agreement. Distributions are paid quarterly, subject to declaration, and reset every five years. Any failure to declare or pay distributions on the Tower Fix ed Rate Interests or Tower Floating Rate Interests (collectively, the 'Tower preferred interests') would not impose any limitation on cash movements between affiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&amp;T shares. We can call the Tower preferred interests at the issue price beginning in November 2029, and we can call the Tower Floating Rate Interests at any time. The Tower preferred interests are included in 'Noncontrolling interest' on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe holders of the Tower preferred interests have the option to require redemption upon the occurrence of certain contingent events, such as the failure of AT&amp;T to pay the preferred distribution for two or more periods or to meet certain other requirements, including a minimum credit rating. If notice is given upon such an event, all other holders of equal or more subordinate classes of membership interests in Tower Holdings are entitled to receive the same form of consideration payable to the holders of the preferred interests, resulting in a deemed liquidation for accounting purposes.\n\n## Telco LLC Preferred Interests\n\nIn September 2020, we issued $2,000 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests (Telco Class A-1) out of a newly created limited liability company (Telco LLC) that was formed to hold telecommunications-related assets. In April 2023, we expanded our September 2020 transaction and issued an additional $5,250 of nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests (Telco Class A-2 and A-3). As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, cumulative preferred interests in our Telco LLC totaled $7,250 (collectively the 'Telco preferred interests').\n\nMembers' equity in Telco LLC consists of (1) members' interests, which are held by a consolidated subsidiary of AT&amp;T, (2) Telco Class A-1 preferred interests, which pay an initial preferred distribution of 4.25% annually, subject to declaration, and subject to reset every seven years, and (3) Telco Class A-2 and A-3 preferred interests, which pay an initial preferred distribution of 6.85% annually, subject to declaration, and subject to reset on November 1, 2027, and every seven years thereafter. Failure to pay distributions on the Telco preferred interests would not limit cash movements between affiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&amp;T shares. We can call the Telco preferred interests at the issue price beginning seven years from the issuance date. The Telco preferred interests are included in 'Noncontrolling interest' on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe holders of the Telco preferred interests have the option to require redemption upon the occurrence of certain contingent events, such as the failure of Telco LLC to pay the preferred distribution for two or more periods or to meet certain other requirements, including a minimum credit rating.

      "question": "How has the structure and total value of Telco LLC's preferred interests evolved from 2022 to 2024, and what changes were made to the distribution rates and reset schedules during this period?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Telco LLC had $2,000 in nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests (Telco Class A-1) with an initial preferred distribution rate of 4.25% annually, subject to reset every seven years. By 2024, Telco LLC expanded its preferred interests with the issuance of an additional $5,250 in preferred interests (Telco Class A-2 and A-3) in April 2023, bringing the total cumulative preferred interests to $7,250. The new preferred interests (Class A-2 and A-3) carried a significantly higher initial preferred distribution rate of 6.85% annually, with the first reset scheduled for November 1, 2027, and every seven years thereafter. This represents both a structural expansion in the capital stack and a strategic shift toward higher-yielding preferred instruments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 - In 2022, Telco LLC had only $2,000 in Class A-1 preferred interests with a 4.25% annual distribution rate reset every seven years.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 - In 2024, Telco LLC had expanded to include $7,250 in preferred interests, including $5,250 in new Class A-2 and A-3 interests with a 6.85% annual distribution rate and a reset schedule starting in 2027.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The change represents a transformation in both the scale and structure of Telco LLC's preferred capital, with a significant increase in total value and a shift to a multi-tiered preferred structure with higher initial distribution rates."

The September series (Class A-1) of the preferred interests totals $1,500 and pays an initial preferred distribution of 5.0%, and the December series (Class A-2) totals $4,500 and pays an initial preferred distribution of 4.75%. Distributions are paid quarterly, subject to declaration, and reset every five years. Any failure to declare or pay distributions on the Tower preferred interests would not impose any limitation on cash movements between affiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&amp;T shares. We can call the Tower preferred interests at the issue price beginning five years from the issuance date or upon the receipt of proceeds from the sale of the underlying assets.\n\nThe holders of the Tower preferred interests have the option to require redemption upon the occurrence of certain contingent events, such as the failure of AT&amp;T to pay the preferred distribution for two or more periods or to meet certain other requirements, including a minimum credit rating. If notice is given upon such an event, all other holders of equal or more subordinate classes of membership interests in Tower Holdings are entitled to receive the same form of consideration payable to the holders of the preferred interests, resulting in a deemed liquidation for accounting purposes.\n\n## Telco LLC\n\nIn September 2020, we issued $2,000 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests out of a newly created limited liability company (Telco LLC) that was formed to hold telecommunication-related assets.\n\nMembers' equity in Telco LLC consist of (1) member's interests, which are held by a consolidated subsidiary of AT&amp;T, and (2) preferred interests (Telco preferred interests), which pay an initial preferred distribution of 4.25% annually, subject to declaration, and subject to reset every seven years.

If notice is given, all other holders of equal or more subordinate classes of members' equity are entitled to receive the same form of consideration payable to the holders of the preferred interests, resulting in a deemed liquidation for accounting purposes.\n\n## PR Holdings\n\nIn 2019, we issued $1,950 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests in a subsidiary (PR Holdings) that held notes secured by the proceeds from our agreement to sell wireless and wireline operations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. These preferred interests were redeemed on November 6, 2020. (See Note 6)\n\nThe membership interests in PR Holdings consisted of (1) common interests, which were held by consolidated subsidiaries of AT&amp;T, and (2) preferred interests (PR preferred interests). The PR preferred interests paid an initial preferred distribution at an annual rate of 4.75%. Distributions were paid quarterly, subject to declaration.\n\n## NOTE 18. SALES OF RECEIVABLES\n\nWe have agreements with various third-party financial institutions pertaining to the sales of certain types of our accounts receivable. The most significant of these programs are discussed in detail below and generally consist of (1) receivables arising from equipment installment plans, which are sold for cash and a deferred purchase price, and (2) revolving service and trade receivables. Under these programs, we transfer receivables to purchasers in exchange for cash and additional consideration upon settlement of the receivables, where applicable. Under the terms of our agreements for these programs, we continue to bill and collect the payments from our customers on behalf of the financial institutions.\n\nThe sales of receivables did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income or to 'Total Assets' reported on our consolidated balance sheets. We reflect cash receipts on sold receivables as cash flows from operations in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Cash receipts on the deferred purchase price are classified as cash flows from investing activities.",

The liabilities associated with the Mobility preferred interests were considered Level 3 under the Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure framework (see Note 12). The difference between the carrying value of the Mobility preferred interest, which represented fair value at contribution, and the fair value of the instrument upon settlement and/or balance sheet reclassification was recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 213 million Mobility preferred interests outstanding, which had a redemption value of approximately $5,340 and paid cash distributions of $373 per annum, subject to declaration. In April 2023, we accepted the December 2022 put option notice from the AT&amp;T pension trust and repurchased the remaining 213 million Mobility preferred interests for a purchase price, including accrued and unpaid distributions, of $5,414.\n\n## Tower Holdings Preferred Interests\n\nIn 2019, we issued $6,000 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests in a wireless subsidiary (Tower Holdings) that holds interests in various tower assets and have the right to receive approximately $6,000 if the purchase options from the tower companies are exercised.\n\nThe membership interests in Tower Holdings consist of (1) common interests, which are held by a consolidated subsidiary of AT&amp;T, and (2) two series of preferred interests (collectively the '2019 Tower preferred interests'). The 2019 Tower preferred interests were subject to reset in December 2024 and included a September series (Tower Class A-1) totaling $1,500 that paid an initial preferred distribution of 5.0%, and a December series (Tower Class A-2) totaling $4,500 that paid an initial preferred distribution of 4.75%.\n\nIn August 2024, we amended the 2019 Tower preferred interests, effective November 2024, to reset the rate and restructure the membership interests whereby all of the 2019 Tower preferred interests are now designated Fixed Rate Class A Limited Membership Interests (Tower Fixed Rate Interests). A portion of the Tower Fixed Rate Interests will move to Floating Rate Class A Limited Membership Interests (Tower Floating Rate Interests) each year over a five-year period. The Tower Fixed Rate Interests pay a preferred distribution of 5.90%, and the Tower Floating Rate Interests, which could equal $525 by 2028 if not called prior, pay a preferred distribution equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus 250 basis points, as defined in the agreement. Distributions are paid quarterly, subject to declaration, and reset every five years. Any failure to declare or pay distributions on the Tower Fix ed Rate Interests or Tower Floating Rate Interests (collectively, the 'Tower preferred interests') would not impose any limitation on cash movements between affiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&amp;T shares. We can call the Tower preferred interests at the issue price beginning in November 2029, and we can call the Tower Floating Rate Interests at any time. The Tower preferred interests are included in 'Noncontrolling interest' on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe holders of the Tower preferred interests have the option to require redemption upon the occurrence of certain contingent events, such as the failure of AT&amp;T to pay the preferred distribution for two or more periods or to meet certain other requirements, including a minimum credit rating. If notice is given upon such an event, all other holders of equal or more subordinate classes of membership interests in Tower Holdings are entitled to receive the same form of consideration payable to the holders of the preferred interests, resulting in a deemed liquidation for accounting purposes.\n\n## Telco LLC Preferred Interests\n\nIn September 2020, we issued $2,000 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests (Telco Class A-1) out of a newly created limited liability company (Telco LLC) that was formed to hold telecommunications-related assets. In April 2023, we expanded our September 2020 transaction and issued an additional $5,250 of nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests (Telco Class A-2 and A-3). As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, cumulative preferred interests in our Telco LLC totaled $7,250 (collectively the 'Telco preferred interests').\n\nMembers' equity in Telco LLC consists of (1) members' interests, which are held by a consolidated subsidiary of AT&amp;T, (2) Telco Class A-1 preferred interests, which pay an initial preferred distribution of 4.25% annually, subject to declaration, and subject to reset every seven years, and (3) Telco Class A-2 and A-3 preferred interests, which pay an initial preferred distribution of 6.85% annually, subject to declaration, and subject to reset on November 1, 2027, and every seven years thereafter. Failure to pay distributions on the Telco preferred interests would not limit cash movements between affiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&amp;T shares. We can call the Telco preferred interests at the issue price beginning seven years from the issuance date. The Telco preferred interests are included in 'Noncontrolling interest' on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe holders of the Telco preferred interests have the option to require redemption upon the occurrence of certain contingent events, such as the failure of Telco LLC to pay the preferred distribution for two or more periods or to meet certain other requirements, including a minimum credit rating.

      "question": "How did AT&T's approach to managing its capital structure through preferred interests evolve from 2023 to 2024, particularly regarding the repurchase of Mobility Preferred Interests and the expansion of Tower Holdings and Telco LLC preferred interests?",
      "answer": "In 2023, AT&T repurchased the remaining 213 million Mobility Preferred Interests for $5,414, removing $2,650 from 'Accounts payable and accrued liabilities' and $2,670 from 'Other noncurrent liabilities.' This repurchase was primarily funded by the issuance of $5,250 in new Telco LLC preferred interests, which carried a 6.85% annual distribution rate. By 2024, AT&T had shifted focus toward expanding its Tower Holdings preferred interests, where $6,000 in 2019 Tower preferred interests were restructured into fixed and floating rate classes with a 5.90% base rate and SOFR + 250 bps, respectively. Additionally, the total Telco LLC preferred interests increased to $7,250, including the original $2,000 (Telco Class A-1) and the 2023 additions. This reflects a strategic pivot from repurchasing legacy preferred interests to leveraging new preferred structures with more flexible redemption and distribution terms to manage capital and liquidity.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, AT&T repurchased the remaining Mobility Preferred Interests for $5,414, funded largely by the issuance of new Telco LLC preferred interests.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, AT&T restructured Tower Holdings preferred interests and expanded Telco LLC holdings, indicating a shift in capital structure strategy.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a strategic evolution from reducing legacy liabilities (Mobility repurchase) to proactively managing capital through new preferred instruments with tailored distribution and reset features."

The liabilities associated with the Mobility preferred interests were considered Level 3 under the Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure framework (see Note 12). The difference between the carrying value of the Mobility preferred interest, which represented fair value at contribution, and the fair value of the instrument upon settlement and/or balance sheet reclassification was recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 213 million Mobility preferred interests outstanding, which had a redemption value of approximately $5,340 and paid cash distributions of $373 per annum, subject to declaration. In April 2023, we accepted the December 2022 put option notice from the AT&amp;T pension trust and repurchased the remaining 213 million Mobility preferred interests for a purchase price, including accrued and unpaid distributions, of $5,414.\n\n## Tower Holdings Preferred Interests\n\nIn 2019, we issued $6,000 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests in a wireless subsidiary (Tower Holdings) that holds interests in various tower assets and have the right to receive approximately $6,000 if the purchase options from the tower companies are exercised.\n\nThe membership interests in Tower Holdings consist of (1) common interests, which are held by a consolidated subsidiary of AT&amp;T, and (2) two series of preferred interests (collectively the '2019 Tower preferred interests'). The 2019 Tower preferred interests were subject to reset in December 2024 and included a September series (Tower Class A-1) totaling $1,500 that paid an initial preferred distribution of 5.0%, and a December series (Tower Class A-2) totaling $4,500 that paid an initial preferred distribution of 4.75%.\n\nIn August 2024, we amended the 2019 Tower preferred interests, effective November 2024, to reset the rate and restructure the membership interests whereby all of the 2019 Tower preferred interests are now designated Fixed Rate Class A Limited Membership Interests (Tower Fixed Rate Interests). A portion of the Tower Fixed Rate Interests will move to Floating Rate Class A Limited Membership Interests (Tower Floating Rate Interests) each year over a five-year period. The Tower Fixed Rate Interests pay a preferred distribution of 5.90%, and the Tower Floating Rate Interests, which could equal $525 by 2028 if not called prior, pay a preferred distribution equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus 250 basis points, as defined in the agreement. Distributions are paid quarterly, subject to declaration, and reset every five years. Any failure to declare or pay distributions on the Tower Fix ed Rate Interests or Tower Floating Rate Interests (collectively, the 'Tower preferred interests') would not impose any limitation on cash movements between affiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&amp;T shares. We can call the Tower preferred interests at the issue price beginning in November 2029, and we can call the Tower Floating Rate Interests at any time. The Tower preferred interests are included in 'Noncontrolling interest' on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe holders of the Tower preferred interests have the option to require redemption upon the occurrence of certain contingent events, such as the failure of AT&amp;T to pay the preferred distribution for two or more periods or to meet certain other requirements, including a minimum credit rating. If notice is given upon such an event, all other holders of equal or more subordinate classes of membership interests in Tower Holdings are entitled to receive the same form of consideration payable to the holders of the preferred interests, resulting in a deemed liquidation for accounting purposes.\n\n## Telco LLC Preferred Interests\n\nIn September 2020, we issued $2,000 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests (Telco Class A-1) out of a newly created limited liability company (Telco LLC) that was formed to hold telecommunications-related assets. In April 2023, we expanded our September 2020 transaction and issued an additional $5,250 of nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests (Telco Class A-2 and A-3). As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, cumulative preferred interests in our Telco LLC totaled $7,250 (collectively the 'Telco preferred interests').\n\nMembers' equity in Telco LLC consists of (1) members' interests, which are held by a consolidated subsidiary of AT&amp;T, (2) Telco Class A-1 preferred interests, which pay an initial preferred distribution of 4.25% annually, subject to declaration, and subject to reset every seven years, and (3) Telco Class A-2 and A-3 preferred interests, which pay an initial preferred distribution of 6.85% annually, subject to declaration, and subject to reset on November 1, 2027, and every seven years thereafter. Failure to pay distributions on the Telco preferred interests would not limit cash movements between affiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&amp;T shares. We can call the Telco preferred interests at the issue price beginning seven years from the issuance date. The Telco preferred interests are included in 'Noncontrolling interest' on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe holders of the Telco preferred interests have the option to require redemption upon the occurrence of certain contingent events, such as the failure of Telco LLC to pay the preferred distribution for two or more periods or to meet certain other requirements, including a minimum credit rating.

      "question": "How did the treatment and financial impact of the Mobility Preferred Interests evolve from 2023 to 2024, particularly in terms of redemption obligations and their effect on earnings per share calculations?",
      "answer": "In 2023, AT&T reclassified the Mobility Preferred Interests from equity to a liability due to the certainty of redemption, recording $2,670 in current liabilities and $2,670 in noncurrent liabilities. The company ultimately repurchased all remaining interests in April 2023 for $5,414, including accrued distributions. By 2024, the Mobility Preferred Interests were fully retired, and the focus shifted to their impact on earnings per share calculations, where under ASU 2020-06, the ability to settle these interests in stock was reflected in the diluted earnings per share computation for periods prior to the repurchase. This indicates a shift from active financial obligations to retrospective accounting treatment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, the Mobility Preferred Interests had a redemption value of $5,340, with $2,670 classified as current liabilities and $2,670 as noncurrent liabilities, culminating in a full repurchase for $5,414.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the Mobility Preferred Interests were no longer outstanding, but their prior existence affected diluted earnings per share calculations under ASU 2020-06.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a transformation from an active financial liability to a retrospective accounting impact, indicating resolution of the obligation with a moderate magnitude of change."

On December 27, 2022, the AT&T pension trust provided written notice of its right to require us to purchase the remaining 213 million, or approximately $5,340, of Mobility preferred interests outstanding. The terms of the instruments limited the amount we were required to redeem in any 12-month period to approximately 107 million shares, or $2,670. With the certainty of redemption, the Mobility preferred interests were reclassified from equity to a liability at fair value, with approximately $2,670 recorded in current liabilities as 'Accounts payable and accrued liabilities,' representing the amount required to be redeemed within one year, and $2,670 recorded in 'Other noncurrent liabilities.' The liabilities associated with the Mobility preferred interests were considered Level 3 under the Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure framework (see Notes 12 and 14). The difference between the carrying value of the Mobility preferred interest, which represented fair value at contribution, and the fair value of the instrument upon settlement and/or balance sheet reclassification was recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 213 million Mobility preferred interests outstanding, which had a redemption value of approximately $5,340 and paid cash distributions of $373 per annum, subject to declaration. In April 2023, we accepted the December 2022 put option notice from the AT&T pension trust and repurchased the remaining 213 million Mobility preferred interest for a purchase price, including accrued and unpaid distributions, of $5,414. |\n| Tower Holdings Preferred Interests In 2019, we issued $6,000 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests in a wireless subsidiary (Tower Holdings) that holds interests in various tower assets and have the right to receive approximately $6,000 if the purchase options from the tower companies are exercised.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| The membership interests in Tower Holdings consist of (1) common interests, which are held by a consolidated subsidiary of AT&T, and (2) two series of preferred interests (collectively the 'Tower preferred interests'). The September series (Tower Class A-1) of the preferred interests totals $1,500 and pays an initial preferred distribution of 5.0%, and the December series (Tower Class A-2) totals $4,500 and pays an initial preferred distribution of 4.75%. Distributions are paid quarterly, subject to declaration, and reset every five years. Any failure to declare or pay distributions on the Tower preferred interests would not impose any limitation on cash movements between affiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&T shares. We can call the Tower preferred interests at the issue price beginning five years from the issuance date or upon the receipt of proceeds from the sale of the underlying assets. The Tower preferred interests are included in 'Noncontrolling interest' on the consolidated balance sheets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| The holders of the Tower preferred interests have the option to require redemption upon the occurrence of certain contingent events, such as the failure of AT&T to pay the preferred distribution for two or more periods or to meet certain other requirements, including a minimum credit rating. If notice is given upon such an event, all other holders of equal or more subordinate classes of membership interests in Tower Holdings are entitled to receive the same form of consideration payable to the holders of the preferred interests, resulting in a deemed liquidation for accounting purposes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Telco LLC Preferred Interests In September 2020, we issued $2,000 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests (Telco Class A-1) out of a newly created limited liability company (Telco LLC) that was formed to hold telecommunication-related assets.

      "answer": "In 2023, the Telco Preferred Interests consisted of $2,000 of Class A-1 preferred interests issued in September 2020, paying a 4.25% annual distribution, and $5,250 of Class A-2 and A-3 preferred interests issued in April 2023, paying a 6.85% annual distribution. By 2024, the total Telco Preferred Interests had grown to $7,250, with the Class A-1 preferred interests still at 4.25% and the Class A-2 and A-3 interests remaining at 6.85%, both subject to reset every seven years. Additionally, in 2024, AT&T clarified that failure to pay distributions would not restrict cash movements or its ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares. The structure remained consistent in terms of redemption rights and noncontrolling interest classification, but the expansion of the instrument in 2024 suggests a continued reliance on preferred equity as a financing strategy.",

        "Step 2: In 2024, the total value of Telco Preferred Interests was $7,250, maintaining the same distribution rates and reset schedules, with no indication of redemption or restructuring.",
        "Step 3: The evolution shows a quantitative increase in the total preferred interest amount with no change in structure or terms, indicating a stable and ongoing financing strategy using preferred equity."

The liabilities associated with the Mobility preferred interests were considered Level 3 under the Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure framework (see Note 12). The difference between the carrying value of the Mobility preferred interest, which represented fair value at contribution, and the fair value of the instrument upon settlement and/or balance sheet reclassification was recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 213 million Mobility preferred interests outstanding, which had a redemption value of approximately $5,340 and paid cash distributions of $373 per annum, subject to declaration. In April 2023, we accepted the December 2022 put option notice from the AT&amp;T pension trust and repurchased the remaining 213 million Mobility preferred interests for a purchase price, including accrued and unpaid distributions, of $5,414.\n\n## Tower Holdings Preferred Interests\n\nIn 2019, we issued $6,000 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests in a wireless subsidiary (Tower Holdings) that holds interests in various tower assets and have the right to receive approximately $6,000 if the purchase options from the tower companies are exercised.\n\nThe membership interests in Tower Holdings consist of (1) common interests, which are held by a consolidated subsidiary of AT&amp;T, and (2) two series of preferred interests (collectively the '2019 Tower preferred interests'). The 2019 Tower preferred interests were subject to reset in December 2024 and included a September series (Tower Class A-1) totaling $1,500 that paid an initial preferred distribution of 5.0%, and a December series (Tower Class A-2) totaling $4,500 that paid an initial preferred distribution of 4.75%.\n\nIn August 2024, we amended the 2019 Tower preferred interests, effective November 2024, to reset the rate and restructure the membership interests whereby all of the 2019 Tower preferred interests are now designated Fixed Rate Class A Limited Membership Interests (Tower Fixed Rate Interests). A portion of the Tower Fixed Rate Interests will move to Floating Rate Class A Limited Membership Interests (Tower Floating Rate Interests) each year over a five-year period. The Tower Fixed Rate Interests pay a preferred distribution of 5.90%, and the Tower Floating Rate Interests, which could equal $525 by 2028 if not called prior, pay a preferred distribution equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus 250 basis points, as defined in the agreement. Distributions are paid quarterly, subject to declaration, and reset every five years. Any failure to declare or pay distributions on the Tower Fix ed Rate Interests or Tower Floating Rate Interests (collectively, the 'Tower preferred interests') would not impose any limitation on cash movements between affiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&amp;T shares. We can call the Tower preferred interests at the issue price beginning in November 2029, and we can call the Tower Floating Rate Interests at any time. The Tower preferred interests are included in 'Noncontrolling interest' on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe holders of the Tower preferred interests have the option to require redemption upon the occurrence of certain contingent events, such as the failure of AT&amp;T to pay the preferred distribution for two or more periods or to meet certain other requirements, including a minimum credit rating. If notice is given upon such an event, all other holders of equal or more subordinate classes of membership interests in Tower Holdings are entitled to receive the same form of consideration payable to the holders of the preferred interests, resulting in a deemed liquidation for accounting purposes.\n\n## Telco LLC Preferred Interests\n\nIn September 2020, we issued $2,000 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests (Telco Class A-1) out of a newly created limited liability company (Telco LLC) that was formed to hold telecommunications-related assets. In April 2023, we expanded our September 2020 transaction and issued an additional $5,250 of nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests (Telco Class A-2 and A-3). As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, cumulative preferred interests in our Telco LLC totaled $7,250 (collectively the 'Telco preferred interests').\n\nMembers' equity in Telco LLC consists of (1) members' interests, which are held by a consolidated subsidiary of AT&amp;T, (2) Telco Class A-1 preferred interests, which pay an initial preferred distribution of 4.25% annually, subject to declaration, and subject to reset every seven years, and (3) Telco Class A-2 and A-3 preferred interests, which pay an initial preferred distribution of 6.85% annually, subject to declaration, and subject to reset on November 1, 2027, and every seven years thereafter. Failure to pay distributions on the Telco preferred interests would not limit cash movements between affiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&amp;T shares. We can call the Telco preferred interests at the issue price beginning seven years from the issuance date. The Telco preferred interests are included in 'Noncontrolling interest' on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe holders of the Telco preferred interests have the option to require redemption upon the occurrence of certain contingent events, such as the failure of Telco LLC to pay the preferred distribution for two or more periods or to meet certain other requirements, including a minimum credit rating.

      "answer": "In 2023, AT&T repurchased all of its Mobility Preferred Interests, which had a redemption value of approximately $5,340 million and paid annual cash distributions of $373 million. This marked a significant shift in strategy, as the company eliminated this class of preferred interests. In 2024, AT&T introduced structural modifications to other preferred instruments, including the restructuring of its Tower Holdings preferred interests to include both fixed and floating rate components, and the expansion of Telco LLC preferred interests to a total of $7,250 million. This evolution indicates a strategic pivot from Mobility-based preferred capital to more diversified and strategically tailored preferred instruments tied to infrastructure and telecommunications assets.",

        "Step 2: In 2024, AT&T restructured its Tower Holdings preferred interests into fixed and floating rate classes and expanded Telco LLC preferred interests to $7,250 million, showing a deliberate shift toward more customized capital instruments.",

The liabilities associated with the Mobility preferred interests were considered Level 3 under the Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure framework (see Note 12). The difference between the carrying value of the Mobility preferred interest, which represented fair value at contribution, and the fair value of the instrument upon settlement and/or balance sheet reclassification was recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 213 million Mobility preferred interests outstanding, which had a redemption value of approximately $5,340 and paid cash distributions of $373 per annum, subject to declaration. In April 2023, we accepted the December 2022 put option notice from the AT&amp;T pension trust and repurchased the remaining 213 million Mobility preferred interests for a purchase price, including accrued and unpaid distributions, of $5,414.\n\n## Tower Holdings Preferred Interests\n\nIn 2019, we issued $6,000 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests in a wireless subsidiary (Tower Holdings) that holds interests in various tower assets and have the right to receive approximately $6,000 if the purchase options from the tower companies are exercised.\n\nThe membership interests in Tower Holdings consist of (1) common interests, which are held by a consolidated subsidiary of AT&amp;T, and (2) two series of preferred interests (collectively the '2019 Tower preferred interests'). The 2019 Tower preferred interests were subject to reset in December 2024 and included a September series (Tower Class A-1) totaling $1,500 that paid an initial preferred distribution of 5.0%, and a December series (Tower Class A-2) totaling $4,500 that paid an initial preferred distribution of 4.75%.\n\nIn August 2024, we amended the 2019 Tower preferred interests, effective November 2024, to reset the rate and restructure the membership interests whereby all of the 2019 Tower preferred interests are now designated Fixed Rate Class A Limited Membership Interests (Tower Fixed Rate Interests). A portion of the Tower Fixed Rate Interests will move to Floating Rate Class A Limited Membership Interests (Tower Floating Rate Interests) each year over a five-year period. The Tower Fixed Rate Interests pay a preferred distribution of 5.90%, and the Tower Floating Rate Interests, which could equal $525 by 2028 if not called prior, pay a preferred distribution equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus 250 basis points, as defined in the agreement. Distributions are paid quarterly, subject to declaration, and reset every five years. Any failure to declare or pay distributions on the Tower Fix ed Rate Interests or Tower Floating Rate Interests (collectively, the 'Tower preferred interests') would not impose any limitation on cash movements between affiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&amp;T shares. We can call the Tower preferred interests at the issue price beginning in November 2029, and we can call the Tower Floating Rate Interests at any time. The Tower preferred interests are included in 'Noncontrolling interest' on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe holders of the Tower preferred interests have the option to require redemption upon the occurrence of certain contingent events, such as the failure of AT&amp;T to pay the preferred distribution for two or more periods or to meet certain other requirements, including a minimum credit rating. If notice is given upon such an event, all other holders of equal or more subordinate classes of membership interests in Tower Holdings are entitled to receive the same form of consideration payable to the holders of the preferred interests, resulting in a deemed liquidation for accounting purposes.\n\n## Telco LLC Preferred Interests\n\nIn September 2020, we issued $2,000 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests (Telco Class A-1) out of a newly created limited liability company (Telco LLC) that was formed to hold telecommunications-related assets. In April 2023, we expanded our September 2020 transaction and issued an additional $5,250 of nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests (Telco Class A-2 and A-3). As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, cumulative preferred interests in our Telco LLC totaled $7,250 (collectively the 'Telco preferred interests').\n\nMembers' equity in Telco LLC consists of (1) members' interests, which are held by a consolidated subsidiary of AT&amp;T, (2) Telco Class A-1 preferred interests, which pay an initial preferred distribution of 4.25% annually, subject to declaration, and subject to reset every seven years, and (3) Telco Class A-2 and A-3 preferred interests, which pay an initial preferred distribution of 6.85% annually, subject to declaration, and subject to reset on November 1, 2027, and every seven years thereafter. Failure to pay distributions on the Telco preferred interests would not limit cash movements between affiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&amp;T shares. We can call the Telco preferred interests at the issue price beginning seven years from the issuance date. The Telco preferred interests are included in 'Noncontrolling interest' on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe holders of the Telco preferred interests have the option to require redemption upon the occurrence of certain contingent events, such as the failure of Telco LLC to pay the preferred distribution for two or more periods or to meet certain other requirements, including a minimum credit rating.

      "question": "How did AT&T's financial obligations and strategic approach to Mobility Preferred Interests evolve between 2023 and 2024, and what does this shift indicate about its broader capital structure management?",
      "answer": "In 2023, AT&T repurchased all remaining Mobility Preferred Interests for a total of $5,414 million, which included accrued and unpaid distributions, effectively eliminating this financial obligation. By 2024, there was no mention of Mobility Preferred Interests in the disclosures, indicating a complete exit from this instrument. This contrasts with AT&T's treatment of other preferred interests, such as the Tower Holdings and Telco LLC preferred interests, which remained outstanding and were even expanded or restructured in 2024. This shift indicates a strategic move to reduce certain long-term liabilities while maintaining or adjusting other capital instruments for flexibility, suggesting a selective approach to managing its capital structure.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, AT&T had $5,340 million in redemption value of Mobility Preferred Interests, which were repurchased in April 2023 for $5,414 million.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the Mobility Preferred Interests were no longer disclosed, while other preferred interests (e.g., Tower Holdings and Telco LLC) were actively managed or expanded.",
        "Step 3: The elimination of Mobility Preferred Interests while maintaining and restructuring other preferred instruments shows a strategic realignment in AT&T\u2019s capital structure management."

      "question": "How has Disney's approach to scripted programming evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of its international general entertainment channels and its strategic shift toward DTC platforms?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Disney operated approximately 220 General Entertainment channels outside the U.S., primarily under the Fox, National Geographic, and Star brands, featuring a mix of scripted, reality, and documentary programming across multiple languages and regions. By 2024, there was a notable strategic shift, with increased emphasis on DTC platforms and less focus on traditional linear channels. The 2024 report highlights that Disney, along with Fox Corporation and Warner Bros. Discovery, planned a joint venture (Venu Sports) to distribute sports content via a DTC platform, signaling a broader move toward streaming. Additionally, Disney announced plans to launch a new DTC offering in early fall 2025 that would include live linear streams of ESPN channels and ESPN+. This reflects a strategic pivot from scripted linear content toward live and sports-driven DTC offerings, indicating a transformation in Disney\u2019s programming and distribution priorities.",

Our international channels use content from the Company's various studios, including library titles, as well as content acquired from third parties.\n\nThe Company's increased focus on DTC distribution in international markets is expected to negatively impact the International Channels business as we shift the primary means of monetizing our content from licensing of linear channels to distribution on our DTC platforms.\n\n## General Entertainment\n\nThe Company operates approximately 220 General Entertainment channels outside the U.S. primarily under the Fox, National Geographic and Star brands, which are broadcast in approximately 40 languages and 180 countries/territories.\n\nFox branded channels air a variety of scripted, reality and documentary programming.

Channels are also broadcast in other countries in Asia Pacific and Latin America.\n\nIn addition, the Company operates UTV and Bindass branded channels principally in India. UTV Action and UTV Movies offer Bollywood movies as well as Hollywood, Asian and Indian regional movies dubbed in Hindi. Bindass is a youth entertainment channel.\n\n## Sports\n\nThe Company operates approximately 55 Sports channels outside the U.S. under the ESPN, Fox and Star brands, which are broadcast in approximately 10 languages and 105 countries/territories.\n\nESPN branded channels primarily operate in Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe.

The Company owns 51% of EMM.\n\nFox branded sports channels primarily operate in Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe. Fox Sports Premium, a pay television service in Argentina, airs the matches of the professional soccer league in Argentina.\n\nStar branded sports channels primarily operate in India and certain other countries in Asia Pacific. Star has rights to various sports programming including cricket, soccer, tennis and field hockey.\n\n## Family\n\nThe Company operates approximately 75 Family channels outside the U.S. primarily under the Disney brand, which are broadcast in approximately 25 languages and 175 countries/territories.",

With respect to the sale of advertising time, we compete with other television networks, independent television stations, MVPDs, other DTC streaming services and other advertising media such as digital content, newspapers, magazines, radio and billboards. Our television stations primarily compete for audiences and advertisers in local market areas.\n\nLinear Networks compete with other networks for carriage by MVPDs. The Company's contractual agreements with MVPDs are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Consolidation and other market conditions in the cable, satellite and telecommunication distribution industry, including subscriber levels, and other factors may adversely affect the Company's ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of its various programming services that are as favorable as those currently in place.\n\nContent Sales/Licensing businesses compete with all forms of entertainment and a significant number of companies that produce and/or distribute film and episodic content, distribute products in the home entertainment market, provide pay TV/VOD services, and produce music and live theater.\n\nThe operating results of Content Sales/Licensing fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods.\n\nWe also compete with other media and entertainment companies, independent production companies and video-on-demand services for creative and performing talent, story properties, show concepts, scripted and other programming, advertiser support, production facilities and exhibition outlets that are essential to the success of our Entertainment businesses.\n\nAdvertising revenues at Linear Networks and Direct-to-Consumer are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. In general, domestic advertising revenues are typically somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months. Affiliate revenues vary with the subscriber levels of MVPDs.\n\n## SPORTS\n\nThe Sports segment generally encompasses the Company's sports-focused global television and DTC video streaming content production and distribution activities.\n\nThe lines of business within Sports include the following:\n\n- ESPN (generally owned 80% by the Company)\n- Domestic:\n- Seven ESPN-branded television channels\n- ESPN on ABC (sports programmed on the ABC Network by ESPN)\n- ESPN+ DTC service\n- International: ESPN-branded channels outside of the U.S.\n- Star: Star-branded sports channels in India\n\nIn February 2024, the Company, Fox Corporation and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. announced plans to create a joint venture to offer a sports-focused DTC platform (Venu Sports) that will distribute each party's domestic sports networks, certain broadcast networks and sports streaming services. In August 2024, a motion for preliminary injunction in a matter before the District Court for the Southern District of New York was granted, enjoining the launch of Venu Sports. See Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding this legal matter. Further, the formation and launch of Venu Sports are subject to the finalization of definitive agreements among the parties.\n\nIn early fall 2025, the Company plans to launch a new DTC offering, which will include live linear streams of the domestic ESPN-branded television channels and ESPN+.\n\nThe significant revenues of Sports are as follows:\n\n- Affiliate fees\n- Advertising\n- Subscription fees\n- Other revenue - Fees from the following activities: pay-per-view events on ESPN+, sub-licensing of sports rights, programming ESPN on ABC and licensing the ESPN brand",

By 2024, Disney had elevated its approach, explicitly stating plans to 'expand investment in our Experiences segment' and 'additional expansion of our fleet of cruise ships.' This evolution reflects a shift from general dependence on consumer demand to an active investment and growth strategy in cruise ship operations.

Economic conditions can also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. In addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector such as current inflation in the domestic and global energy sector and other pronounced price increases generally and in certain other sectors, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and consumer products we offer, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs. A decline in economic conditions could impact implementation of our business plans, such as our plans to realign our cost structure and for the new DTC ad-supported service, pricing structure and price increases. In addition, actions to reduce inflation, including raising interest rates, increase our cost of borrowing, which in turn could make it more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or investments on favorable terms. Further, global economic conditions may impact foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. The current or continued strength in the value of the U.S. dollar has adversely impacted the U.S. dollar value of revenue we receive and expect to receive from other markets and may reduce international demand for our products and services. A decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar may increase our labor, supply or other costs in non-U.S. markets. Although we hedge exposure to certain foreign currency fluctuations, any such hedging activity may not substantially offset the negative financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and is not expected to offset all such negative financial impact, particularly in periods of sustained U.S. dollar strength relative to multiple foreign currencies. Further, economic or political conditions in countries outside the U.S. also have reduced, and could continue to reduce, our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in those countries or our ability to repatriate revenue from those countries. Broader supply chain delays, such as those currently impacting global distribution may further exacerbate current inflationary pressures and impact our ability to sell and deliver goods or otherwise disrupt our operations. The adverse impact on our businesses of the decline in economic conditions will depend, in part, on its severity and duration and our ability to mitigate the impacts of this decline on our businesses will be limited.\n\n## Changes in technology and in consumer consumption patterns may affect demand for our entertainment products, the revenue we can generate from these products or the cost of producing or distributing products.\n\nThe media entertainment and internet businesses in which we participate increasingly depend on our ability to successfully adapt to shifting patterns of content consumption through the adoption and exploitation of new technologies. New technologies affect the demand for our products, the manner in which our products are distributed to consumers, ways we charge for and receive revenue for our entertainment products and the stability of those revenue streams, the sources and nature of competing content offerings, the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired audiences. This trend has impacted the business model for certain traditional forms of distribution, as evidenced by the industry-wide decline in ratings for broadcast television, the reduction in demand for home entertainment sales of theatrical content, the development of alternative distribution channels for broadcast and cable programming and declines in subscriber levels for traditional cable channels, including for a number of our networks. In addition, theater-going to watch movies currently is, and may continue to be, below pre-COVID-19 levels. Declines in linear viewership have resulted in decreased advertising revenue. In order to respond to these developments, we regularly consider, and from time to time implement changes to our business models, most recently by developing, investing in and acquiring DTC products, initiating plans to again reorganize our media and entertainment businesses to advance our DTC strategies, and developing next generation storytelling offerings. There can be no assurance that our DTC offerings, next generation storytelling offerings and other efforts will successfully respond to these changes. In addition, declines in certain traditional forms of distribution may increase the cost of content allocable to our DTC offerings, negatively impacting the profitability of our DTC offerings. We expect to forgo revenue from traditional sources, particularly as we expand our DTC offerings. To date we have experienced significant losses in our DTC businesses. There can be no assurance that the DTC model and other business models we may develop will ultimately be profitable or as profitable as our existing or historic business models.\n\n## Misalignment with public and consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment, travel and consumer products could negatively impact demand for our entertainment offerings and products and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses.\n\nOur businesses create entertainment, travel and consumer products whose success depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently create compelling content, which may be distributed, among other ways, through broadcast, cable, internet or cellular technology, theme park attractions, hotels and other resort facilities and travel experiences and consumer products. Such distribution must meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market and respond to competition from an expanding array of choices facilitated by technological developments in the delivery of content. The success of our theme parks, resorts, cruise ships and experiences, as well as our theatrical releases, depends on demand for public or out-of-home",

In addition, third-party suppliers provide products and services essential to the operation of a number of our businesses. A wide variety of factors could influence the success of those third parties and if negative factors significantly impacted a sufficient number of those third parties or materially impacted a supplier of a significant product or service, the profitability of one or more of our businesses could be adversely affected. In specific geographic markets, we have experienced delayed and/or partial payments from certain third parties due to liquidity issues.\n\nWe obtain insurance against the risk of losses relating to some of these events, generally including certain physical damage to our property and resulting business interruption, certain injuries occurring on our property and some liabilities for alleged breach of legal responsibilities. When insurance is obtained it is subject to deductibles, exclusions, terms, conditions and limits of liability. The types and levels of coverage we obtain vary from time to time depending on our view of the likelihood of specific types and levels of loss in relation to the cost of obtaining coverage for such types and levels of loss and we ex perience losses not covered by our insurance, which could be material.\n\n## We face risks related to changes in our business strategy, which have affected and may continue to affect our cost structure, the profitability of our businesses and/or the value of our assets.\n\nWe adjust our business strategies from time to time in connection with changes in senior management and in our efforts to respond to changes in technology, consumer purchasing and consumption patterns, acceptance of our entertainment offerings, the market for advertising, macroeconomic conditions and other changes in the business environment. For example, in fiscal 2024, we announced entering into a definitive agreement to transfer Star India into a joint venture and related impairment charges; in fiscal 2023, we reorganized our media and entertainment operations, which had been previously reported in one segment, into two segments, Entertainment and Sports; in fiscal 2023 we announced that we would review content, primarily on our DTC services, for alignment with a strategic change in our approach to content curation, resulting in removal of certain content from our platforms and related impairment charges; in fiscal 2022, we announced plans to introduce an ad-supported Disney+ service, new pricing model and price increases and cost realignment; and we have announced exploration of a number of new types of businesses. Changes in strategy, such as was the case with the most recent reorganization of our media and entertainment operations, can lead to workforce disruptions. Our new business strategies are, among other things, subject to execution risk and may not produce the anticipated benefits, such as supporting our growth strategies and enhancing shareholder value. For example, notwithstanding our continuing efforts to rationalize costs, the cost of executing on our DTC strategy may continue to grow or be reduced more slowly than anticipated, which may impact our distribution strategy across businesses/distribution platforms, the types of content we distribute through various businesses/distribution platforms, the timing and sequencing of content windows and ultimately, the profitability of our DTC products and other businesses/distribution platforms. Over the long term, our new organization and strategies could be less successful than our previous organizational structure and strategies.\n\nIn addition, changing technology, consumer purchasing patterns and acceptance of content offerings and macroeconomic conditions may impair the value of our assets. We incur costs in connection with changes to our business strategy and have needed and may in the future need to write-down the value of our assets. Among other assets, we have impaired the value of our content primarily at our DTC services and goodwill and intangible assets at our linear networks and impaired the value of certain of our retail store assets. We may write down other assets as our strategy evolves to account for the business environment.\n\nWe also make investments in existing or new businesses, including investments in international expansion of our business and in new business lines. For example, in fiscal 2024, we announced plans for additional expansion of our fleet of cruise ships, and in recent years to ex pand investment in our Ex periences segment. In addition, in recent years, we have made significant investments in our businesses, such as expansion and renovation of certain of our theme parks, additional cruise ships, the acquisition of TFCF Corporation (TFCF) and investments related to DTC offerings. The ultimate success of these investments is uncertain, some of these and future investments may ultimately result in returns that are negative or lower than anticipated, and these investments may impact the resources available to, and the profitability of, our other businesses. In addition, our costs increase in connection with these investments, such as additional ex penses incurred with the launch on new cruise ships, and we may have significant charges associated with the write-down of assets if the investments are not as successful as anticipated, as occurred in connection with the closure of Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser. Even if our strategies are effective in the long term, our new offerings will generally not be profitable in the short term, results of our new offerings are unlikely to be even quarter over quarter and we may not ex pand into new markets as or when anticipated. Our ability to forecast for new businesses is impacted by our lack of experience operating in those new businesses, speed with which the competitive landscape changes, volatility beyond our control (such as the events beyond our control noted above) and our ability to obtain or develop the content and rights on which our projections are based. Accordingly, we may not achieve our forecasted outcomes.",

      "answer": "AT&T's financial guarantee relationship with Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. remained consistent between 2022 and 2023, with the company continuing to guarantee certain obligations of Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. in both years. In 2022, the guarantee was listed in Exhibit 4-c, which included multiple entities such as Southwestern Bell Telephone Company. In 2023, the guarantee was again referenced in Exhibit 4-c, maintaining the same inclusion of Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. within the list of guaranteed entities. This indicates no change in the nature or scope of the guarantee.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 - In 2022, AT&T guaranteed certain obligations of Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. as part of a broader guarantee agreement listed in Exhibit 4-c.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 - In 2023, AT&T continued to guarantee certain obligations of Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., with the guarantee still referenced in Exhibit 4-c.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - There was no change in the guarantee relationship; it remained stable across both years."

      "question": "How did AT&T's relationship with The Ohio Bell Telephone Company evolve between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of its guarantee obligations?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AT&T had a guarantee obligation covering The Ohio Bell Telephone Company as part of a broader list of subsidiaries under Exhibit 4-c, which was originally filed in 2011. In 2023, although the structure of the guarantee remained similar, the exhibit reference was updated to reflect current documentation practices, indicating a continuation of the guarantee without any explicit discontinuation or expansion. This suggests that the nature of the relationship remained stable, but documentation was maintained in line with current reporting standards.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, AT&T's 10-K filing under Exhibit 4-c explicitly listed The Ohio Bell Telephone Company among other entities for which AT&T provided guarantees, referencing the 2011 filing.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the same guarantee was still in place, with The Ohio Bell Telephone Company included in the list of covered entities under Exhibit 4-c, though the underlying documentation remained unchanged from 2011, suggesting no material change in the obligation.",
        "Step 3: The relationship did not show signs of expansion or reduction; however, the exhibit reference was maintained in the updated 2023 filing, indicating continuity and administrative updating rather than substantive change."

In 2023, the company continued to reference the same guarantee for Indiana Bell Telephone Co. Inc. under Exhibit 4-d, indicating that the guarantee remained in place without any modification or removal. Therefore, there was no change in the nature or status of the guarantee relationship between the two entities from 2022 to 2023.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, Indiana Bell Telephone Co. Inc. was explicitly listed in Exhibit 4-d as one of the entities whose obligations were guaranteed by AT&T.",

        "Step 3: Since the guarantee inclusion of Indiana Bell Telephone Co. Inc. was consistent across both years, the relationship remained stable with no evolution."

      "question": "How did Disney's strategic focus on cruise ships evolve between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of capital investment plans and operational risk considerations?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Disney highlighted cruise ships as a key part of its capital investment strategy within the Parks & Experiences segment, noting that a majority of its capital spending was directed toward theme parks, resorts, and cruise ships. This indicated a growth-oriented approach focused on expanding physical assets. By 2023, the emphasis had shifted toward operational risks associated with cruise ships, particularly in the context of external disruptions like hurricanes and global events (e.g., the impact of Hurricane Milton on Walt Disney World operations). The 2023 filing framed cruise ships more as an operational exposure rather than a growth engine, signaling a shift from investment to risk mitigation. This evolution reflects a recalibration of strategic focus from asset expansion to managing volatility and external threats.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Disney explicitly included cruise ships in its significant capital investment plans, showing a strategic intent to grow the cruise business as part of the Parks & Experiences segment.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, Disney discussed cruise ships primarily in the context of operational risks, such as weather-related disruptions and global events, indicating a shift from growth planning to risk exposure management.",
        "Step 3: The change in framing from capital investment to risk exposure reflects a strategic evolution in Disney's approach to cruise ships, likely influenced by recent operational challenges and market conditions."

      "question": "How did the structural change in Disney's relationship with A&E from 2022 to 2023 affect its reporting of subscriber numbers and financial stake in the partnership?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Disney reported A&E as a partner with 69 million domestic subscribers, indicating a collaborative but arms-length relationship. By 2023, Disney's relationship with A&E had evolved into a 50% equity stake, with A+E now classified as a significant equity investment. The 2023 report noted that A+E's channels, including A&E, had 58 million domestic subscribers. This shift from a partnership to a joint ownership model altered how Disney reported both subscriber data and financial performance, moving from simple subscriber counts in 2022 to including A+E\u2019s financial results under 'Equity in the income of investees' in 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [

      "answer": "In 2022, Disney's 10-K filing highlighted cruise ships as part of its broader Experiences segment but did not specifically emphasize capital investment in them, instead noting general risks from macroeconomic conditions such as inflation, supply chain delays, and currency fluctuations that could impact the implementation of business plans, including those for parks and resorts. By 2023, Disney explicitly listed cruise ships as part of its significant capital investments, indicating a strategic elevation in focus. The 2023 filing stated that the majority of the company\u2019s capital spend was directed toward parks and experiences, including 'new attractions, cruise ships, capital improvements and systems infrastructure.' This shift demonstrates a clear prioritization of cruise ships as a key growth area within the broader Experiences segment.",

        "Step 3: The change reflects a strategic shift from a general mention within Experiences to a named priority in capital allocation, indicating increased emphasis on cruise ship development."

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nof and prices for advertising on our broadcast and cable networks and owned stations, performance of our home entertainment releases, and purchases of Company-branded consumer products, and similar impacts can be expected as such conditions recur. The current decline in economic conditions could also reduce attendance at our parks and resorts, prices that MVPDs pay for our cable programming, purchases of and prices for advertising on our DTC products or subscription levels for our cable programming or DTC products, while also increasing the prices we pay for goods, services and labor. Economic conditions can also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. In addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector such as current inflation in the domestic and global energy sector and other pronounced price increases generally and in certain other sectors, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and consumer products we offer, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs. A decline in economic conditions could impact implementation of our business plans, such as our plans to realign our cost structure and for the new DTC ad-supported service, pricing structure and price increases. In addition, actions to reduce inflation, including raising interest rates, increase our cost of borrowing, which in turn could make it more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or investments on favorable terms. Further, global economic conditions may impact foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. The current or continued strength in the value of the U.S. dollar has adversely impacted the U.S. dollar value of revenue we receive and expect to receive from other markets and may reduce international demand for our products and services. A decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar may increase our labor, supply or other costs in non-U.S. markets. Although we hedge exposure to certain foreign currency fluctuations, any such hedging activity may not substantially offset the negative financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and is not expected to offset all such negative financial impact, particularly in periods of sustained U.S. dollar strength relative to multiple foreign currencies. Further, economic or political conditions in countries outside the U.S. also have reduced, and could continue to reduce, our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in those countries or our ability to repatriate revenue from those countries. Broader supply chain delays, such as those currently impacting global distribution may further exacerbate current inflationary pressures and impact our ability to sell and deliver goods or otherwise disrupt our operations. The adverse impact on our businesses of the decline in economic conditions will depend, in part, on its severity and duration and our ability to mitigate the impacts of this decline on our businesses will be limited.\n\n## Changes in technology and in consumer consumption patterns may affect demand for our entertainment products, the revenue we can generate from these products or the cost of producing or distributing products.\n\nThe media entertainment and internet businesses in which we participate increasingly depend on our ability to successfully adapt to shifting patterns of content consumption through the adoption and exploitation of new technologies. New technologies affect the demand for our products, the manner in which our products are distributed to consumers, ways we charge for and receive revenue for our entertainment products and the stability of those revenue streams, the sources and nature of competing content offerings, the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired audiences. This trend has impacted the business model for certain traditional forms of distribution, as evidenced by the industry-wide decline in ratings for broadcast television, the reduction in demand for home entertainment sales of theatrical content, the development of alternative distribution channels for broadcast and cable programming and declines in subscriber levels for traditional cable channels, including for a number of our networks. In addition, theater-going to watch movies currently is, and may continue to be, below pre-COVID-19 levels. Declines in linear viewership have resulted in decreased advertising revenue. In order to respond to these developments, we regularly consider, and from time to time implement changes to our business models, most recently by developing, investing in and acquiring DTC products, initiating plans to again reorganize our media and entertainment businesses to advance our DTC strategies, and developing next generation storytelling offerings. There can be no assurance that our DTC offerings, next generation storytelling offerings and other efforts will successfully respond to these changes. In addition, declines in certain traditional forms of distribution may increase the cost of content allocable to our DTC offerings, negatively impacting the profitability of our DTC offerings. We expect to forgo revenue from traditional sources, particularly as we expand our DTC offerings. To date we have experienced significant losses in our DTC businesses. There can be no assurance that the DTC model and other business models we may develop will ultimately be profitable or as profitable as our existing or historic business models.\n\n## Misalignment with public and consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment, travel and consumer products could negatively impact demand for our entertainment offerings and products and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses.\n\nOur businesses create entertainment, travel and consumer products whose success depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently create compelling content, which may be distributed, among other ways, through broadcast, cable, internet or cellular technology, theme park attractions, hotels and other resort facilities and travel experiences and consumer products. Such distribution must meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market and respond to competition from an expanding array of choices facilitated by technological developments in the delivery of content. The success of our theme parks, resorts, cruise ships and experiences, as well as our theatrical releases, depends on demand for public or out-of-home",
