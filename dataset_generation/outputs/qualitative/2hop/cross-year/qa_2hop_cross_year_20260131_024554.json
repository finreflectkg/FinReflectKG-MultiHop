      "question": "How did General Motors' financial and legal relationship with Stellantis evolve between 2022 and 2024, particularly regarding indemnification obligations and investment gains?",
      "answer": "In 2022, General Motors reported a gain of $0.2 billion related to Stellantis N.V. (Stellantis) warrants, indicating a positive financial relationship. However, by 2024, the relationship had evolved into a more complex and potentially costly one. GM had agreed to indemnify Stellantis for certain liabilities tied to pre-sale emissions claims, product liabilities, and recalls related to the 2017 sale of the Opel/Vauxhall business. Additionally, GM faced potential future liabilities from ongoing investigations into Opel\u2019s historical conduct in Europe. Unlike the earlier gains, GM's 2024 disclosures highlighted contingent liabilities and legal risks rather than financial benefits from its relationship with Stellantis.",

        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 (2022) \u2014 GM reported a $0.2 billion gain from Stellantis warrants, indicating a positive financial relationship.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 (2024) \u2014 GM had indemnification obligations toward Stellantis, including for emissions claims, recalls, and potential fines from historical Opel conduct, with no financial gains reported.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change \u2014 The relationship shifted from a source of financial gain to one of contingent liability and legal exposure."

After further investigation into the manufacturing processes at our battery supplier, LG  Energy Solution (LGES), and disassembling battery packs, we determined that the risk of battery cell defects was not confined to the initial recall population. As a result, in August 2021, we expanded the recall to include all 2017-2022 model year Chevrolet Bolt EV  and Chevrolet Bolt Electric Utility V ehicles (EUVs). LG Electronics, Inc. (LGE) and LGES (collectively, LG ), have agreed to reimburse GM for certain costs and expenses associated with the recall. The commercial negotiations with LG  also resolved other commercial matters associated with our Ultium Cells Holdings LLC joint venture with LGES. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2024, we had accrued a total of $2.6 billion and recognized receivables totaling $1.6 billion in connection with these matters. At December 31, 2024, our remaining accrual for these matters was $0.3 billion.  These charges reflect our current best estimate for the cost of the recall remedy, which includes non-traditional recall remedies provided by GM to enhance customer satisfaction. The actual costs of the recall could be materially higher or lower.\n\nIn addition, putative class actions have been filed against GM in the U.S. and Canada alleging that the batteries contained in the Bolt EV s and EUV s included in the recall population are defective. G M has agreed to settle the U.S. class actions for an immaterial amount and the settlement agreement is pending final court approval.\n\nOpel/Vauxhall Sale In  2017,  we  sold  the  Opel/V aux hall  Business  to  PSA  G roup  (now  Stellantis)  under  a  Master Agreement  (the Agreement).  We also sold the European financing subsidiaries and branches to Banque PSA Finance S.A. and BNP Paribas Personal Finance S.A. Although the sale reduced our new vehicle presence in Europe, we may still be impacted by actions taken by regulators related to vehicles sold before the sale. General Motors Holdings LLC agreed, on behalf of our wholly owned subsidiary (the Seller), to indemnify Stellantis for certain losses resulting from any inaccuracy of the representations and warranties or breaches of our covenants included in the Agreement and for certain other liabilities, including costs related to certain emissions claims, product liabilities and recalls. We are unable to estimate any reasonably possible material loss or range of loss that may result from these actions either directly or through an indemnification claim from Stellantis. Certain of these indemnification obligations are subject to time limitations, thresholds and/or caps as to the amount of required payments.\n\nCurrently, various consumer lawsuits have been filed against the Seller and Stellantis in G ermany, the UK, Austria and the Netherlands alleging that Opel and Vauxhall vehicles sold by the Seller violated applicable emissions standards. In addition, we indemnified Stellantis for an immaterial amount for certain recalls that Stellantis has conducted or will conduct, including recalls in certain geographic locations that Stellantis intends to conduct related to Takata inflators in legacy Opel vehicles. We may in the future be required to further indemnify Stellantis relating to its Takata recalls, but we believe such further indemnification to be remote at this time.\n\nEuropean Commission and UK Competition and Markets Authority Matter In March 2022, the European Commission and UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) conducted inspections at the premises of, and sent out formal requests for information to, several companies and associations active in the automotive sector. The investigations concern conduct related to coordination regarding the collection, treatment and recovery of end-of-life cars and vans, which are considered waste. GM was not the subject of the inspections but has since received requests for information related to activities conducted by Opel, a former subsidiary business we sold to  Stellantis in 2017.  G M has replied to the  European  Commission's and  CMA's requests for information.  The inspections and requests for information are preliminary investigatory steps and do not prejudge the outcome of the investigations, and as of December 31, 2024, we had accrued an immaterial amount related to this matter. If an infringement is established as to Opel's conduct, there are a range of possible outcomes, including fines, which could be material.\n\nPrivacy and Consumer Protection Matters There are putative class actions pending against GM in federal courts in the U.S. alleging violations of state and federal privacy and consumer protection laws related to the collection and use of certain consumer data obtained through our former OnStar Smart Driver product. In June 2024, those class actions were consolidated into a multi-district litigation proceeding in the Northern District of G eorgia. In addition, a number of federal and state agencies and attorneys general have opened investigations or made inquiries of us relating to these alleged consumer protection and privacy issues. The Company is fully cooperating with these agencies and attorneys general. At this stage, we are not able to estimate any reasonably possible or probable material loss or range of loss that may result from these actions.\n\nProduct Liability and Breach of Warranty We record liabilities related to product liability claims in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities for the ex pected cost of all known product liability claims, plus an estimate of the expected cost for product liability claims that have already been incurred and are expected to be filed in the future for which we are self-insured.

      "question": "How did General Motors' long-term rate of return assumptions on U.S. pension plan assets evolve between 2022 and 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's strategic asset mix adjustments?",
      "answer": "In 2022, General Motors reported that the weighted-average long-term rate of return on U.S. pension plan assets decreased from 5.6% at December 31, 2020, to 5.4% at December 31, 2021. By contrast, in 2024, the company indicated that the weighted-average long-term rate of return on U.S. pension plan assets increased from 6.3% at December 31, 2023, to 6.5% at December 31, 2024. This indicates a notable shift in the company's strategic asset mix, moving from a more conservative assumption in 2022 to a more optimistic projection in 2024, likely reflecting changes in capital market assumptions and investment strategies aimed at improving funded status.",

      "answer": "In 2022, General Motors highlighted that fleet transactions, especially sales to daily rental car companies, were generally less profitable compared to retail sales, and these vehicles were sold either directly or through the dealer network. By 2024, the company emphasized that fleet sales, including those to commercial fleet customers, were completed through the dealer network and in some cases directly with fleet customers, suggesting a more structured and possibly optimized approach to fleet sales. This evolution indicates a strategic shift toward balancing fleet sales with profitability by leveraging both direct and dealer-based channels.",

Segment Reporting\n\nOur chief operating decision-maker, who is our Chair and Chief Executive Officer, analyzes the results of our business through the following reportable segments: GMNA, GMI, Cruise and GM Financial. Our chief operating decision-maker evaluates the operating results and performance of our automotive segments and Cruise through EBIT-adjusted, which is presented net of noncontrolling interests. Our chief operating decision-maker evaluates GM Financial through EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are an integral part of its operational and financial performance. These financial metrics are used to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions and to monitor budget-to-actual variances on a monthly basis. To manage operations and make decisions regarding resource allocations, our chief operating decision-maker is regularly provided and reviews expense information at a consolidated, functional level for our global purchasing and supply chain, manufacturing and engineering functions. Warranty and quality metrics are also viewed on a consolidated basis. Currently, a focus is being placed on driving an efficient, consolidated fixed cost structure and managing overall global headcount. V ehiclelevel profitability metrics are also reviewed during the planning stage and throughout a program's life cycle on a forecasted basis, and not on an actual basis. Each segment has a manager responsible for executing our strategic initiatives.\n\nSubstantially all of the trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts produced are marketed through retail dealers in North America and through distributors and dealers outside of North America, the substantial majority of which are independently owned. In addition to the products sold to dealers for consumer retail sales, trucks, crossovers and cars are also sold to fleet customers, including daily rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing companies and governments. Fleet sales are completed through the dealer network and in some cases directly with fleet customers. Retail and fleet customers can obtain a wide range of after-sale vehicle services and products through the dealer network, such as maintenance, light repairs, collision repairs, vehicle accessories and extended service warranties.\n\nGMNA meets the demands of customers in North America and GMI primarily meets the demands of customers outside North America, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. We also have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet the demands of customers in other countries, primarily  China, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the  Baojun,  Buick,  Cadillac,  Chevrolet and  Wuling brands.  Cruise  is  our  global  segment  responsible  for  the  development  of  AV   technology,  and  includes  AV -related  engineering  and  other  costs.  We  provide automotive financing services through our GM Financial segment.\n\nOur automotive interest income and interest expense, legacy costs from the Opel/V auxhall Business (primarily pension costs), corporate expenditures and certain revenues and expenses that are not part of a reportable segment are recorded centrally in Corporate. Corporate assets primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and intersegment balances.

      "answer": "In 2022, General Motors continued to have supply-related transactions with Stellantis following the sale of the Opel/Vauxhall business, indicating an ongoing operational relationship. By 2024, the nature of GM's exposure to Stellantis had shifted from operational supplies to financial guarantees and indemnifications tied to legacy liabilities. Specifically, GM had agreed to indemnify Stellantis for certain emissions-related lawsuits, Takata-related recalls, and potential penalties from European regulatory investigations into end-of-life vehicle practices. Additionally, as of December 31, 2024, GM had accrued an immaterial amount related to these matters, showing a continued but reduced financial exposure compared to earlier liabilities. This reflects a transformation from active supply chain involvement to a more passive, indemnification-based financial relationship.",

        "Step 3: The shift from active supply arrangements to indemnification-based obligations indicates a transformation in the nature of GM\u2019s relationship with Stellantis, with reduced direct operational ties and continued, but limited, financial exposure."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n\nChevrolet Bolt Recall In July 2021, we initiated a voluntary recall for certain 2017-2019 model year Chevrolet Bolt EV s due to the risk that two manufacturing defects present in the same battery cell could cause a high voltage battery fire in certain of these vehicles. After further investigation into the manufacturing processes at our battery supplier, LG  Energy Solution (LGES), and disassembling battery packs, we determined that the risk of battery cell defects was not confined to the initial recall population. As a result, in August 2021, we expanded the recall to include all 2017-2022 model year Chevrolet Bolt EV  and Chevrolet Bolt Electric Utility V ehicles (EUVs). LG Electronics, Inc. (LGE) and LGES (collectively, LG ), have agreed to reimburse GM for certain costs and expenses associated with the recall. The commercial negotiations with LG  also resolved other commercial matters associated with our Ultium Cells Holdings LLC joint venture with LGES. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2024, we had accrued a total of $2.6 billion and recognized receivables totaling $1.6 billion in connection with these matters. At December 31, 2024, our remaining accrual for these matters was $0.3 billion.  These charges reflect our current best estimate for the cost of the recall remedy, which includes non-traditional recall remedies provided by GM to enhance customer satisfaction. The actual costs of the recall could be materially higher or lower.\n\nIn addition, putative class actions have been filed against GM in the U.S. and Canada alleging that the batteries contained in the Bolt EV s and EUV s included in the recall population are defective. G M has agreed to settle the U.S. class actions for an immaterial amount and the settlement agreement is pending final court approval.\n\nOpel/Vauxhall Sale In  2017,  we  sold  the  Opel/V aux hall  Business  to  PSA  G roup  (now  Stellantis)  under  a  Master Agreement  (the Agreement).  We also sold the European financing subsidiaries and branches to Banque PSA Finance S.A. and BNP Paribas Personal Finance S.A. Although the sale reduced our new vehicle presence in Europe, we may still be impacted by actions taken by regulators related to vehicles sold before the sale. General Motors Holdings LLC agreed, on behalf of our wholly owned subsidiary (the Seller), to indemnify Stellantis for certain losses resulting from any inaccuracy of the representations and warranties or breaches of our covenants included in the Agreement and for certain other liabilities, including costs related to certain emissions claims, product liabilities and recalls. We are unable to estimate any reasonably possible material loss or range of loss that may result from these actions either directly or through an indemnification claim from Stellantis. Certain of these indemnification obligations are subject to time limitations, thresholds and/or caps as to the amount of required payments.\n\nCurrently, various consumer lawsuits have been filed against the Seller and Stellantis in G ermany, the UK, Austria and the Netherlands alleging that Opel and Vauxhall vehicles sold by the Seller violated applicable emissions standards. In addition, we indemnified Stellantis for an immaterial amount for certain recalls that Stellantis has conducted or will conduct, including recalls in certain geographic locations that Stellantis intends to conduct related to Takata inflators in legacy Opel vehicles. We may in the future be required to further indemnify Stellantis relating to its Takata recalls, but we believe such further indemnification to be remote at this time.\n\nEuropean Commission and UK Competition and Markets Authority Matter In March 2022, the European Commission and UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) conducted inspections at the premises of, and sent out formal requests for information to, several companies and associations active in the automotive sector. The investigations concern conduct related to coordination regarding the collection, treatment and recovery of end-of-life cars and vans, which are considered waste. GM was not the subject of the inspections but has since received requests for information related to activities conducted by Opel, a former subsidiary business we sold to  Stellantis in 2017.  G M has replied to the  European  Commission's and  CMA's requests for information.  The inspections and requests for information are preliminary investigatory steps and do not prejudge the outcome of the investigations, and as of December 31, 2024, we had accrued an immaterial amount related to this matter. If an infringement is established as to Opel's conduct, there are a range of possible outcomes, including fines, which could be material.\n\nPrivacy and Consumer Protection Matters There are putative class actions pending against GM in federal courts in the U.S. alleging violations of state and federal privacy and consumer protection laws related to the collection and use of certain consumer data obtained through our former OnStar Smart Driver product. In June 2024, those class actions were consolidated into a multi-district litigation proceeding in the Northern District of G eorgia. In addition, a number of federal and state agencies and attorneys general have opened investigations or made inquiries of us relating to these alleged consumer protection and privacy issues. The Company is fully cooperating with these agencies and attorneys general. At this stage, we are not able to estimate any reasonably possible or probable material loss or range of loss that may result from these actions.\n\nProduct Liability and Breach of Warranty We record liabilities related to product liability claims in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities for the ex pected cost of all known product liability claims, plus an estimate of the expected cost for product liability claims that have already been incurred and are expected to be filed in the future for which we are self-insured.

By fiscal year 2024, this amount significantly decreased to $1.9 million in derivative assets under the same category. Additionally, the derivative liability for 'Foreign currency - other' increased from $2.0 million in 2023 to $4.7 million in 2024.

      "answer": "In 2023, Starbucks recognized revenue from ready-to-drink beverages under the 'Other Revenues' category, where sales were generally recognized upon shipment to customers depending on contract terms. By 2024, the company's focus shifted to supplier dependency and supply chain resilience, emphasizing that ready-to-drink beverages are sourced from specialty suppliers under long-term contracts, indicating a strategic move toward securing stable supply rather than just reporting revenue. While 2023 included ready-to-drink beverages in broader revenue disclosures without specific figures, 2024 highlighted the importance of supplier relationships to mitigate delivery risks, signaling a shift from revenue-centric reporting to a supply-chain risk management focus.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nTo help ensure the future supply of high-quality green coffee and to reinforce our leadership role in the coffee industry, Starbucks operates ten farmer support centers, including our China Farmer Support Center located in the Yunnan Province of this high-growth market. Farmer support centers are staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts who work with coffee farming communities to promote best practices in coffee production designed to improve both coffee quality and yields as well as agronomy support to address climate change and other impacts.\n\nIn addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy, particularly fluid milk, and to a lesser degree, plant-based dairy-free alternative products, such as oat milk and almond milk, to support the needs of our company-operated stores. We believe, based on the established relationship and historical performance of our dairy and plant-based dairy-free suppliers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient fluid milk and plant-based dairy-free alternatives to support our stores generally is remote.\n\nProducts other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in Starbucks stores include tea and a number of ready-to-drink beverages that are purchased from several specialty suppliers, usually under long-term supply contracts. Food products, such as pastries, breakfast sandwiches, and lunch items, are purchased from national, regional, and local sources. We also purchase a broad range of paper and plastic products, such as cups and cutlery, from several companies to support the needs of our retail stores as well as our manufacturing and distribution operations. We are also expanding our use of reusable packaging to reduce landfill waste. We believe, based on the established relationship and historical performance of our suppliers and manufacturers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient amounts of these items generally is remote.\n\n## Competition\n\nOur primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are specialty coffee retailers and shops. We believe that our customers choose among specialty coffee retailers and shops primarily on the basis of product quality, brand reputation, service, and convenience, as well as price. We continue to experience direct competition from large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector and the ready-to-drink coffee beverage market, in addition to both well-established and start-up companies in many international markets. We also compete with restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores.\n\nOur coffee and tea products sold through our Channel Development segment compete directly against specialty coffees and teas sold through grocery stores, warehouse clubs, specialty retailers, convenience stores, and foodservice accounts and also compete indirectly against all other coffees and teas on the market.\n\n## Trademarks, Copyrights, Patents, and Domain Names\n\nStarbucks owns and has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and in other countries throughout the world. Some of our trademarks, including Starbucks, the Starbucks logo, Starbucks Reserve, and Frappuccino, are of material importance. The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained.\n\nWe own numerous copyrights for items such as product packaging, promotional materials, in-store graphics, and training materials. We also hold patents on certain products, systems, and designs, which have an average remaining duration of approximately thirteen years. In addition, Starbucks has registered and maintains numerous Internet domain names, including 'Starbucks.com,' 'Starbucks.net,' and 'Starbucksreserve.com.'\n\n## Seasonality and Quarterly Results\n\nOur business is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations, of which our second fiscal quarter typically experiences lower revenues and operating income. Additionally, as Starbucks Cards are issued to, and loaded by, customers during the holiday season, we tend to have higher cash flows from operations during the first quarter of the fiscal year. However, since revenues from Starbucks Cards are recognized upon redemption and not when cash is loaded onto the Starbucks Cards, the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings is much less pronounced. As a result of moderate seasonal fluctuations, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.\n\n## Government Regulation\n\nAs a company with global operations, we are subject to the laws and regulations of the United States and the multiple foreign jurisdictions in which we operate as well as the rules, reporting obligations, and interpretations of all such requirements and obligations by various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions. In addition, changes to such laws, regulations, rules, reporting obligations, and related compliance obligations could result in significant costs but are not expected to have a material effect on our capital ex penditures, results of operations, and competitive position as compared to prior periods.",

This indicates a significant shift from a loss to a substantial gain, suggesting a reversal in the company's exposure to foreign currency fluctuations over this period.",

      "question": "How has Starbucks' investment relationship with Valor Siren Ventures I L.P. evolved between fiscal years 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of the carrying value of the investment and its financial impact on Starbucks' consolidated statements?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2023, Starbucks held a limited partnership interest in Valor Siren Ventures I L.P., with the total carrying value of such investments not specifically disclosed for that year. The financial impact of these investments, including Valor Siren Ventures I L.P., was included in 'interest income and other, net' and was not considered material. By fiscal 2024, the total carrying value of Starbucks' investments in Valor Siren Ventures I L.P. and II L.P. combined was $211.9 million as of September 29, 2024. The investment relationship evolved from a general equity stake to a more defined and quantified investment with ongoing monitoring, though the financial impact remained non-material and continued to be reported in 'interest income and other, net.'",

        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 (2023) \u2014 Starbucks held a limited partnership interest in Valor Siren Ventures I L.P., but the specific carrying value for this fund alone was not disclosed.",

      "question": "How has Starbucks' relationship with the Global Coffee Alliance evolved from fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2023 in terms of strategic emphasis and revenue contribution?",
      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, the Global Coffee Alliance contributed to the growth of the Channel Development segment, which saw a $250 million increase in revenue driven by product sales and royalty income from the alliance. By fiscal year 2023, the strategic emphasis on the Global Coffee Alliance had evolved, with Starbucks explicitly highlighting its licensing relationship with Nestl\u00e9 under the alliance as a core channel for product distribution, indicating a deeper integration and ongoing importance to Starbucks' global licensing and product expansion strategy. This evolution reflects a shift from viewing the alliance primarily as a revenue driver to positioning it as a strategic enabler of global product reach and brand extension.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, the evidence shows that the Global Coffee Alliance contributed $250 million in revenue growth to the Channel Development segment.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the alliance is described as a licensing mechanism with Nestl\u00e9, integral to Starbucks' global product distribution and brand extension strategy.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a shift from a revenue-focused relationship to a more strategically embedded partnership."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n## General\n\nOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted. Fiscal year 2022 included 52 weeks. Fiscal year 2021 included 53 weeks, with the 53rd week falling in the fourth fiscal quarter, and fiscal year 2020 included 52 weeks; comparable store sale percentages below are calculated excluding the 53rd week.\n\nThe discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended September 27, 2020, included in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ('MD&amp;A') can be found in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 3, 2021.\n\n## Overview\n\nWe have three reportable operating segments: 1) North America, which is inclusive of the U.S. and Canada; 2) International, which is inclusive of China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean; and 3) Channel Development. Non-reportable operating segments and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other.\n\nOur financial results and long-term growth model will continue to be driven by new store openings, comparable store sales and margin management. We believe these key operating metrics are useful to investors because management uses these metrics to assess the growth of our business and the effectiveness of our marketing and operational strategies. Throughout this MD&amp;A, we commonly discuss the following key operating metrics:\n\n- New store openings and store count\n- Comparable store sales\n- Operating margin\n\nStarbucks results for fiscal 2022 demonstrate the resiliency and strength of our brand. Consolidated revenues increased 11% to $32.3 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to $29.1 billion in fiscal 2021, primarily driven by strength in our U.S. business and growth in our International segment excluding China, partially offset by the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($496 million) and unfavorable foreign currency translation.\n\nFor both the North America segment and U.S. market, comparable store sales increased 12% for fiscal 2022 compared to an increase of 22% and 21% for the North America segment and the U.S. market, respectively, in fiscal 2021. Average ticket for the North America segment and the U.S. market grew 7% and 8%, respectively, primarily driven by strategic pricing and increased demand for food items in our U.S. market. The segment also experienced higher costs, primarily related to investments and growth in labor including enhanced store partner wages as well as increased spend on new partner training. Also contributing were inflationary pressures on commodities and our supply chain. In fiscal 2022, we announced our Reinvention Plan in the U.S. market to increase efficiency while elevating the partner and customer experience. We believe the investments in partner wages and training will increase retention and productivity while the acceleration of purpose-built store concepts and innovations in technologies will provide additional convenience and connection with our customers.\n\nFor the International segment, comparable store sales decreased by 9% for fiscal 2022 compared to an increase of 16% in fiscal 2021, driven by comparable store sales decline of 24% in our China market. During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2022, our China market experienced COVID-19 pandemic related restrictions in multiple cities that severely impacted customer mobility. Outside of China, strong growth in our major International markets, driven by product innovation and increasing digital capabilities, partially offset the unfavorability in our China market.\n\nRevenue for our Channel Development segment increased $250 million, or 16%, when compared with fiscal 2021, driven by higher product sales to and royalty revenue from the Global Coffee Alliance and growth in our global ready-to-drink business. Operating margin decreased 520 basis points to 44.3%, primarily due to a decline in our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture income due to inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints as well as business mix shift.\n\nDespite COVID-19 induced business interruptions, especially in our China market, we have seen the strength and resilience of our brand as well as strong customer demand across our portfolio. We expect inflationary pressures on commodities and supply chain to continue to a lesser extent in fiscal 2023, relative to the impact on our business and financial metrics, including operating margin, as compared to fiscal 2022. We anticipate that these should be offset by benefits from pricing decisions as well as from increased sales leverage and higher productivity driven by our Reinvention Plan. Absent significant and prolonged COVID-19 relapses or global economic disruptions, and based on the current trend of our business operations and our focused efforts on the Reinvention Plan, we are confident in the strength of our brand and strategy for sustainable, profitable growth over the long-term.",

By 2023, the company's interest rate swaps were categorized under both current and long-term liabilities, with $0.4 million listed under accrued liabilities (current) and $19.2 million under other long-term liabilities.

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Starbucks reported a foreign currency - other derivative asset of $55.3 million in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) with $32.5 million expected to be reclassified into earnings within 12 months. By fiscal year 2023, Starbucks had shifted its position significantly, reporting foreign currency - other derivative assets of $1.9 million in current assets and $1.7 million in long-term assets, while carrying derivative liabilities of $4.7 million in current liabilities and $4.1 million in long-term liabilities. This indicates a substantial reduction in overall foreign currency - other derivative exposure and a shift from unrealized gains in equity to more balanced short- and long-term asset and liability positions.",

        "Step 3: Analyze the change as a significant reduction in overall foreign currency - other derivative exposure with a more balanced approach to asset and liability positions."

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Starbucks reported foreign currency - other derivative assets of $103.9 million recognized in OCI before reclassifications and $22.0 million reclassified from AOCI to earnings. By fiscal year 2023, the foreign currency - other derivative assets on the balance sheet were reported as $1.9 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $1.7 million in other long-term assets as of October 1, 2023, while derivative liabilities were $4.7 million in accrued liabilities and $4.1 million in other long-term liabilities. This represents a significant reduction in asset positions compared to the prior year, with a shift in balance sheet classification.",

        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 (2022) - Starbucks disclosed $103.9 million in foreign currency - other gains recognized in OCI before reclassifications and $22.0 million reclassified from AOCI to earnings.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 (2023) - Starbucks reported foreign currency - other derivative assets of $1.9 million in prepaid expenses and $1.7 million in other long-term assets, and liabilities of $4.7 million in accrued liabilities and $4.1 million in other long-term liabilities as of October 1, 2023.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - There was a significant decrease in the magnitude of foreign currency - other derivative assets from 2022 to 2023, with a complete change in reporting methodology and balance sheet classification."

      "answer": "In 2023, McDonald's disclosed that developmental licensees paid royalties based on a percentage of sales and generally paid initial fees, and the company allocated consideration among lease and non-lease components using historical methods. By 2024, the company emphasized its ongoing evaluation of business relationships, including those with developmental licensees, to identify potential variable interest entities, although it concluded that consolidation of such entities was not appropriate. Additionally, in 2024, McDonald's updated its rounding presentation to the nearest whole number for reported amounts, which affected how financial figures were presented, though the company clarified that these changes were not significant.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, McDonald's disclosed specific financial arrangements with developmental licensees, including royalty structures and initial fees, and maintained a consistent allocation method for consideration in franchise contracts.",

        "Step 3: The evolution centers on a shift from a focus on contractual revenue allocation in 2023 to a broader emphasis on financial reporting standards and entity evaluation in 2024, indicating a more strategic and compliance-oriented approach to managing developmental licensee relationships."

Investments in affiliates owned 50% or less (primarily McDonald's China and Japan) are accounted for by the equity method.\n\nOn an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its business relationships such as those with franchisees, joint venture partners, developmental licensees, suppliers and advertising cooperatives to identify potential variable interest entities. Generally, these businesses qualify for a scope exception under the variable interest entity  consolidation guidance. The Company has concluded that consolidation of such entities is not appropriate for the periods presented.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the Company changed its rounding presentation to the nearest whole number in millions of reported amounts, except per share data or as otherwise designated. The change in rounding presentation has been applied to all prior year amounts presented. In certain circumstances, this change adjusted previously reported balances, however, these changes were not significant, and no other changes were made to previously reported financial information. A dditionally, certain columns and rows within the financial statements and tables presented may not add due to rounding. Percentages have been calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts for all periods presented.\n\n## ESTIMATES IN F INANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. A ctual results could differ from those estimates.\n\n## FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION\n\nGenerally, the functional currency of operations outside the U.S. is the respective local currency.",

      "answer": "In 2023, McDonald's described its relationship with franchisees as a collaborative partnership focused on consistency, quality, and revenue generation through rent, royalties based on a percent of sales, and initial fees. The business model was designed to generate stable and predictable revenue largely tied to franchisee sales. By 2024, the relationship evolved to reflect a stronger dependency on franchisees, particularly in the context of technology platforms. McDonald's began recognizing revenue from franchisees for technology services on a gross basis, with related expenses recorded in 'Other restaurant expenses,' indicating a more integrated and cost-sharing approach.

The pronouncement expands annual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company adopted the new standard in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. Refer to the Segment footnote on page 52 of this Form 10-K for the enhanced disclosures added as a result of the adoption of A SU 2023-07.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\" (\"ASU 2023-09\"). The pronouncement expands the disclosure requirements for income taxes, specifically related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. A SU 2023-09 is effectiv e for fiscal y ears beginning after December 15, 2024. We are currently in the process of determining the impact that A SU 2023-09 will have on the Company's consolidated financial statement disclosures.\n\n## Disaggregation - Income Statement Expenses\n\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, \"Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\" (\"ASU 2024-03\"). The pronouncement expands the disclosure requirements for expenses, specifically by providing more detailed information about the types of expenses in commonly presented expense captions. A SU 2024-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. We are currently in the process of determining the impact that A SU 2024-03 will have on the Company's consolidated financial statement disclosures.\n\n## REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nThe Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-owned and operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to developmental licensees and affiliates include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. The Company's Other revenues are primarily comprised of fees paid by franchisees to recover a portion of costs incurred by the Company for various technology platforms, revenues from brand licensing arrangements to market and sell consumer packaged goods using the M cDonald's brand and thirdparty revenues for the Dynamic Y ield business, for periods prior to its sale on A pril 1, 2022.\n\nSales by Company-owned and operated restaurants are recognized on a cash basis at the time of the underlying sale and are presented net of sales tax and other sales-related taxes. Royalty revenues are based on a percent of sales and recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Rental income includes both minimum rent payments, which are recognized straight-line over the franchise term and variable rent payments based on a percent of sales, which are recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Initial fees are recognized as the Company satisfies the performance obligation over the franchise term, which is generally 20 years.\n\nThe Company provides goods or services related to various technology platforms to certain franchisees that are distinct from the franchise agreement because they do not require integration with other goods or services that the Company provides. The Company has determined that it is the principal in these arrangements. Accordingly, the related revenue is presented on a gross basis on the Consolidated Statement of Income. These revenues are recognized as the goods or services are transferred to the franchisee, and related expenses are recognized as incurred, primarily within Other restaurant expenses. There may be a timing difference between the costs the Company incurs and the related fees the Company receives from franchisees, but the various technology platform fees are not designed to generate margins for the Company. Brand licensing arrangement revenues are based on a percent of sales and are recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. For periods prior to A pril 1, 2022, Dynamic Y ield third party revenues were generated from providing software as a service solutions to customers and were recognized over the applicable subscription period as the service was performed.\n\n## PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and amortization provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildings-up to 40 years; leasehold improvements-the lesser of useful lives of assets or lease terms, which generally include certain option periods; and equipment-3 to 12 years.\n\nThe Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods.\n\nThe Company may share in the cost of certain restaurant improvements with its franchisees. Since M cDonald's generally manages the project and provides up front funding in these instances, during the project the Company estimates which costs are the responsibility of M cDonald's and which are the responsibility of the franchisee, and allocates the corresponding costs between Property and equipment and Accounts receivable. Upon the completion of the project, the allocation of costs is finaliz ed and may result in immaterial adjustments to the balances and associated depreciation expense.\n\nRefer to the Property and Equipment footnote on page 54 of this Form 10-K for additional information.",

      "question": "How has McDonald's use of line of credit agreements evolved between 2023 and 2024 in relation to its financing activities and cash flow management?",
      "answer": "In 2023, McDonald's cash used for financing activities totaled $4.4 billion, a decrease of $2.2 billion compared to 2022, primarily due to increased bond issuances. The company's cash and equivalents balance was $4.6 billion at the end of 2023, reflecting sufficient liquidity supported by cash from operations and access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements. In 2024, cash used for financing activities increased to $7.5 billion, a rise of $3.1 billion compared to 2023, driven by decreased bond issuances. The company's cash and equivalents balance dropped to $1.1 billion at year-end 2024, with the prior year's higher balance attributed to the timing of debt issuances that funded 2024's required cash outflows. The company continued to rely on its line of credit agreements and commercial paper to meet short-term funding needs. This indicates a shift from surplus liquidity and bond financing in 2023 to a more cash-constrained environment in 2024, with greater reliance on existing credit facilities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, cash used for financing activities decreased to $4.4 billion due to increased bond issuances, and the company ended with a $4.6 billion cash balance, indicating strong liquidity and reduced reliance on credit facilities.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, cash used for financing activities increased to $7.5 billion due to reduced bond issuances, and the cash balance dropped to $1.1 billion, showing increased reliance on line of credit agreements to fund operations.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a shift in financing strategy and liquidity management, with a decrease in available cash and an increased dependence on line of credit agreements in 2024 compared to 2023."

Free cash flow was $6.7 billion in 2024, a decrease of $580 million or 8%. The Company's free cash flow conversion rate was 81% in 2024 and 86% in 2023.\n\nCash used for investing activities totaled $5.3 billion in 2024, an increase of $2.1 billion compared with 2023. The increase was primarily due to the Company's increased ownership stake in M cDonald's China business, the acquisition of M cDonald's business in Israel and higher capital expenditures due to restaurant development initiatives.\n\nCash used for financing activities totaled $7.5 billion in 2024, an increase of $3.1 billion compared with 2023. The increase was primarily due to decreased bond issuances in the current year.\n\nThe Company's cash and equivalents balance was $1.1 billion and $4.6 billion at year end 2024 and 2023, respectively. The higher cash balance in 2023 reflected the timing of certain debt issuances associated with the Company's required uses of cash in 2024. In addition to cash and equivalents on hand and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short-term funding needs through its continued access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements.\n\n## RESTAURANT DE VE LOPME NT AND CAPITAL E XPE N D ITU R E S\n\nIn 2024, the Company opened 2,116 restaurants and closed 461 restaurants.

      "answer": "In 2023, McDonald's revenue from franchisees primarily included rent and royalties based on a percentage of sales with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. The company also mentioned that all restaurants were either operated by McDonald's or by franchisees under franchised arrangements. By 2024, the revenue recognition model remained consistent, but the company provided more detailed disclosures on how it recognizes revenue from franchisees, including the treatment of technology platform fees, which are now presented on a gross basis on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Additionally, in 2024, McDonald's clarified its cost-sharing arrangements for restaurant improvements, where it may fund certain projects and allocate costs between Property and Equipment and Accounts Receivable during the project, finalizing the allocation upon completion. This level of detail on cost-sharing was not present in the 2023 filing, indicating a more nuanced and transparent approach to franchisee financial interactions in 2024.",

ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024.

We are currently in the process of determining the impact that A SU 2024-03 will have on the Company's consolidated financial statement disclosures.\n\n## REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nThe Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-owned and operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to developmental licensees and affiliates include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. The Company's Other revenues are primarily comprised of fees paid by franchisees to recover a portion of costs incurred by the Company for various technology platforms, revenues from brand licensing arrangements to market and sell consumer packaged goods using the M cDonald's brand and thirdparty revenues for the Dynamic Y ield business, for periods prior to its sale on A pril 1, 2022.\n\nSales by Company-owned and operated restaurants are recognized on a cash basis at the time of the underlying sale and are presented net of sales tax and other sales-related taxes. Royalty revenues are based on a percent of sales and recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Rental income includes both minimum rent payments, which are recognized straight-line over the franchise term and variable rent payments based on a percent of sales, which are recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Initial fees are recognized as the Company satisfies the performance obligation over the franchise term, which is generally 20 years.\n\nThe Company provides goods or services related to various technology platforms to certain franchisees that are distinct from the franchise agreement because they do not require integration with other goods or services that the Company provides. The Company has determined that it is the principal in these arrangements. Accordingly, the related revenue is presented on a gross basis on the Consolidated Statement of Income. These revenues are recognized as the goods or services are transferred to the franchisee, and related expenses are recognized as incurred, primarily within Other restaurant expenses. There may be a timing difference between the costs the Company incurs and the related fees the Company receives from franchisees, but the various technology platform fees are not designed to generate margins for the Company. Brand licensing arrangement revenues are based on a percent of sales and are recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. For periods prior to A pril 1, 2022, Dynamic Y ield third party revenues were generated from providing software as a service solutions to customers and were recognized over the applicable subscription period as the service was performed.\n\n## PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and amortization provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildings-up to 40 years; leasehold improvements-the lesser of useful lives of assets or lease terms, which generally include certain option periods; and equipment-3 to 12 years.\n\nThe Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods.\n\nThe Company may share in the cost of certain restaurant improvements with its franchisees. Since M cDonald's generally manages the project and provides up front funding in these instances, during the project the Company estimates which costs are the responsibility of M cDonald's and which are the responsibility of the franchisee, and allocates the corresponding costs between Property and equipment and Accounts receivable. Upon the completion of the project, the allocation of costs is finaliz ed and may result in immaterial adjustments to the balances and associated depreciation expense.\n\nRefer to the Property and Equipment footnote on page 54 of this Form 10-K for additional information.",

      "answer": "In 2023, McDonald's relationship with franchisees was primarily characterized by the acquisition of restaurants from franchisees, resulting in goodwill that was either fully or partially written off depending on the time of sale relative to acquisition. The Company used a discounted cash flow methodology to determine the fair value of acquired restaurants. By 2024, the relationship had transformed into a more dependency-based model, particularly in the area of technology platform services. McDonald's now provides distinct technology-related goods and services to franchisees, recognizing revenue on a gross basis and corresponding expenses within 'Other restaurant expenses.' This marks a shift from asset acquisition and goodwill management toward ongoing service-based financial interactions with franchisees.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, the Company's relationship with franchisees involved purchasing restaurants, generating goodwill, and managing write-offs based on sale timing (e.g., full write-off if sold within 24 months).",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the relationship evolved to include distinct service arrangements where the Company acts as principal in providing technology platforms to franchisees, recognizing revenue and expenses directly tied to these services.",

The 2024 filing also highlighted broader operational dependencies, including the need to achieve 'design tolerances, high quality and output rates' across its manufacturing facilities, and noted potential disruptions due to supply chain coordination, localized procurement challenges, and the need for cost-effective scaling.

In addition, we manufacture vehicle drive units and energy storage components there. Gigafactory Nevada allows us to access high volumes of lithium-ion battery cells manufactured by our partner Panasonic there while achieving a significant reduction in the cost of our battery packs. We continue to invest in Gigafactory Nevada to achieve additional output there.\n\n## Gigafactory New York in Buffalo, New York\n\nWe use Gigafactory New York for the development and production of our Solar Roof and other solar products and components, energy storage components and Supercharger components and for other functions.\n\n## Gigafactory Shanghai in China\n\nWe established Gigafactory Shanghai to increase the affordability of our vehicles for customers in local markets by reducing transportation and manufacturing costs and eliminating the impact of unfavorable tariffs. We continue to increase the degree of localized procurement and manufacturing there. Gigafactory Shanghai is representative of our plan to iteratively improve our manufacturing operations as we establish new factories, as we implemented the learnings from our Model 3 and Model Y ramp at the Fremont Factory to commence and ramp our production at Gigafactory Shanghai quickly and cost-effectively.\n\n## Other Manufacturing\n\nGenerally, we continue to expand production capacity at our existing facilities. We also intend to further increase costcompetitiveness in our significant markets by strategically adding local manufacturing, including at Gigafactory Berlin in Germany and Gigafactory Texas in Austin, Texas, which will begin production in 2022.\n\n## Supply Chain\n\nOur products use thousands of purchased parts that are sourced from hundreds of suppliers across the world. We have developed close relationships with vendors of key parts such as battery cells, electronics and complex vehicle assemblies. Certain components purchased from these suppliers are shared or are similar across many product lines, allowing us to take advantage of pricing efficiencies from economies of scale.\n\nAs is the case for most automotive companies, most of our procured components and systems are sourced from single suppliers. Where multiple sources are available for certain key components, we work to qualify multiple suppliers for them where it is sensible to do so in order to minimize production risks owing to disruptions in their supply. We also mitigate risk by maintaining safety stock for key parts and assemblies and die banks for components with lengthy procurement lead times.",

          "chunk_text": "## Solar Energy Offerings\n\nWe sell retrofit solar energy systems to customers and channel partners and also make them available through power purchase agreement ('PPA') arrangements. We purchase most of the components for our retrofit solar energy systems from multiple sources to ensure competitive pricing and adequate supply. We also design and manufacture certain components for our solar energy products.\n\nWe sell our Solar Roof, which combines premium glass roof tiles with energy generation, directly to customers, as well as through channel customers. We continue to improve our installation capability and efficiency, including through collaboration with real estate developers and builders on new homes.\n\n## Technology\n\n## Automotive\n\n## Battery and Powertrain\n\nOur core vehicle technology competencies include powertrain engineering and manufacturing and our ability to design vehicles that utilize the unique advantages of an electric powertrain. We have designed our proprietary powertrain systems to be adaptable, efficient, reliable and cost-effective while withstanding the rigors of an automotive environment. We offer dual motor powertrain vehicles, which use two electric motors to maximize traction and performance in an all-wheel drive configuration, as well as vehicle powertrain technology featuring three electric motors for further increased performance in certain versions of Model S and Model X.\n\nAmong other things, we maintain extensive testing and R&amp;D capabilities for battery cells, packs and systems, and have built an expansive body of knowledge on lithium-ion cell chemistry types and performance characteristics. In order to enable a greater supply of cells for our products with higher energy density at lower costs, we are currently using our expertise to develop a new proprietary lithium-ion battery cell and improved manufacturing processes.\n\n## Vehicle Control and Infotainment Software\n\nThe performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs require sophisticated control software. Control systems in our vehicles optimize performance, customize vehicle behavior, manage charging and control all infotainment functions. We develop almost all of this software, including most of the user interfaces, internally and update our vehicles' software regularly through over-the-air updates.\n\n## Self-Driving Development\n\nWe have expertise in developing technologies, systems and software to enable self-driving vehicles using primarily visionbased sensors. Our FSD Computer runs our neural networks in our vehicles, and we are also developing additional computer hardware to better enable the massive amounts of field data captured by our vehicles to continually train and improve these neural networks for real-world performance.\n\nCurrently, we offer in our vehicles certain advanced driver assist systems under our Autopilot and FSD options. Although at present the driver is ultimately responsible for controlling the vehicle, our systems provide safety and convenience functionality that relieves drivers of the most tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel much like the system that airplane pilots use, when conditions permit. As with other vehicle systems, we improve these functions in our vehicles over time through over-theair updates.\n\nWe intend to establish in the future an autonomous Tesla ride-hailing network, which we expect would also allow us to access a new customer base even as modes of transportation evolve.\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage\n\n## Energy Storage Products\n\nWe leverage many of the component-level technologies from our vehicles in our energy storage products. By taking a modular approach to the design of battery systems, we can optimize manufacturing capacity of our energy storage products. Additionally, our expertise in power electronics enables our battery systems to interconnect with electricity grids while providing fast-acting systems for power injection and absorption. We have also developed software to remotely control and dispatch our energy storage systems.\n\n## Solar Energy Systems\n\nWe have engineered Solar Roof over numerous iterations to combine aesthetic appeal and durability with power generation. The efficiency of our solar energy products is aided by our own solar inverter, which also incorporates our power electronics technologies. We designed both products to integrate with Powerwall.",

          "chunk_text": "## Energy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment\n\nThe long-term success of this business is dependent upon increasing margins through greater volumes. We continue to increase the production of our energy storage products to meet high levels of demand, including beginning construction of our Megafactory in Lathrop, California, but such production is also sensitive to global component constraints. For Megapack, energy storage deployments can vary meaningfully quarter to quarter depending on the timing of specific project milestones. For Powerwall, better availability and growing grid stability concerns drive higher customer interest, and we are emphasizing crossselling with our residential solar energy products. We remain committed to growing our retrofit solar energy business by offering a low-cost and simplified online ordering experience. In addition, we continue to improve our installation capabilities and price efficiencies for Solar Roof by on-boarding and training new installers, as well as collaborating with real estate developers and builders on new homes to reduce installation time and costs. As these product lines grow, we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products and hire additional personnel, particularly skilled electricians, to support the ramp of Solar Roof.\n\n## Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends\n\nOur capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time, and may further be impacted by uncertainties in future global market conditions. We are simultaneously ramping new products in the new Model S and Model X, Megapack and Solar Roof, ramping manufacturing facilities on three continents and piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies, and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall priority among projects, the pace at which we meet milestones, production adjustments to and among our various products, increased capital efficiencies and the addition of new projects. Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development and all other continuing infrastructure growth, we currently expect our capital expenditures to be between $5.00 to $7.00 billion in 2022 and each of the next two fiscal years.\n\nOur business has recently been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend, and with better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales growth is also facilitating positive cash generation. On the other hand, we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods depending on the specific pace of our capital-intensive projects and rising material prices and increasing supply chain and labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and labor availability associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, as our stock price has significantly increased, we have seen higher levels of early conversions of 'in-themoney' convertible senior notes, which obligates us to deliver cash and or shares pursuant to the terms of those notes. Overall, we expect our ability to be self-funding to continue as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales.\n\n## Operating Expense Trends\n\nAs long as we see expanding sales, and excluding the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions including increased labor costs and impairment charges on certain assets as explained below, we generally expect operating expenses relative to revenues to decrease as we continue to increase operational efficiency and process automation. We expect operating expenses to grow in 2022 as we are expanding our operations globally.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2021, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin. We believe in the long-term potential of digital assets both as an investment and also as a liquid alternative to cash. As with any investment and consistent with how we manage fiat-based cash and cash-equivalent accounts, we may increase or decrease our holdings of digital assets at any time based on the needs of the business and our view of market and environmental conditions. Digital assets are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules. Accordingly, any decrease in their fair values below our carrying values for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition will require us to recognize impairment charges, whereas we may make no upward revisions for any market price increases until a sale. For any digital assets held now or in the future, these charges may negatively impact our profitability in the periods in which such impairments occur even if the overall market values of these assets increase. For example, in the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded approximately $101 million of impairment losses resulting from changes to the carrying value of our bitcoin and gains of $128 million on certain sales of bitcoin by us.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ('GAAP'). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected.",

The unavailability of any component or supplier could result in production delays, idle manufacturing facilities, product design changes and loss of access to important technology and tools for producing and supporting our products, as well as impact our capacity expansion and our ability to fulfill our obligations under customer contracts. Moreover, significant increases in our production or product design changes by us have required and may in the future require us to procure additional components in a short amount of time. We have faced in the past, and may face suppliers who are unwilling or unable to sustainably meet our timelines or our cost, quality and volume needs, which may increase our costs or require us to replace them with other sources. Finally, as we construct new manufacturing facilities and add production lines to existing facilities, we may experience issues in correspondingly increasing the level of localized procurement at those facilities. While we believe that we will be able to secure additional or alternate sources or develop our own replacements for most of our components, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so quickly or at all. Additionally, we may be unsuccessful in our continuous efforts to negotiate with existing suppliers to obtain cost reductions and avoid unfavorable changes to terms, source less expensive suppliers for certain parts and redesign certain parts to make them less expensive to produce, especially in the case of increases in materials pricing.

In order to be successful, we will need to implement, maintain and ramp efficient and cost-effective manufacturing capabilities, processes and supply chains and achieve the design tolerances, high quality and output rates we have planned at our manufacturing facilities in California, Nevada, Texas, China, Germany and any future sites such as Mexico. We will also need to hire, train and compensate skilled employees to operate these facilities. Bottlenecks and other unexpected challenges such as those we experienced in the past may arise during our production ramps, and we must address them promptly while continuing to improve manufacturing processes and reducing costs. If we are not successful in achieving these goals, we could face delays in establishing and/or sustaining our product ramps or be unable to meet our related cost and profitability targets.\n\nWe have experienced, and may also experience similar future delays in launching and/or ramping production of our energy storage products and Solar Roof; new product versions or variants; new vehicles; and future products, features and services based on artificial intelligence. Likewise, we may encounter delays with the design, construction and regulatory or other approvals necessary to build and bring online future manufacturing facilities and products.

          "chunk_text": "Franchisees are responsible for reinvesting capital in their businesses over time. In addition, to accelerate implementation of certain initiatives, the Company may co-invest with franchisees to fund improvements to their restaurants or operating systems. These investments, developed in collaboration with franchisees, are designed to cater to consumer preferences, improve local business performance and increase the value of the M cDonald's brand through the development of modernized, more attractive and higher revenue generating restaurants.\n\nThe Company requires franchisees to meet rigorous standards and generally does not work with passive investors. The business relationship with franchisees is designed to facilitate consistency and high quality at all M cDonald's restaurants. Conventional franchisees contribute to the Company's revenue, primarily through the payment of rent and royalties based upon a percent of sales, with specified minimum rent payments, along with initial fees paid upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new franchise. The Company's heavily franchised business model is designed to generate stable and predictable revenue, which is largely a function of franchisee sales, and resulting cash flow streams.\n\n## Developmental License or Affiliate\n\nUnder a developmental license or affiliate arrangement, licensees are responsible for operating and managing their businesses, providing capital (including the real estate interest) and developing and opening new restaurants. The Company generally does not invest any restaurant capital under a developmental license or affiliate arrangement, and it receives a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally receives initial fees upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new license.\n\nWhile developmental license and affiliate arrangements are largely the same, affiliate arrangements are used in a limited number of foreign markets (primarily China and Japan) within the International Developmental Licensed M arkets &amp; Corporate segment as well as a limited number of individual restaurants within the International Operated M arkets segment, where the Company also has an equity investment and records its share of net results in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates.\n\n## PURPOSE, MISSION AND VALUE S\n\nThrough its size and scale, M cDonald's embraces and prioritizes its role and commitment to the communities in which it operates through its purpose to feed and foster communities, and its mission to make delicious feel-good moments easy for everyone. The Company is guided by five core values that define who it is and how it runs the business across the three-legged stool of M cDonald's franchisees, suppliers, and employees:\n\n1. Serve - We put our customers and people first;\n2. Inclusion - We open our doors to everyone;\n3. Integrity - We do the right thing;\n4. Community - We are good neighbors; and\n5. Family - We get better together.\n\nThe Company believes that its people, all around the world, set it apart and bring these values to life daily.\n\n## HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\nThe Company's people strategies aim to support an inclusive environment that represents the communities in which it operates. To do this, the Company offers quality training and learning opportunities and upholds high standards of health and safety designed to create and maintain a safe and respectful workplace for its employees. In support of the Company's values, the Company's annual incentive plan holds the Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") and Executive Officers accountable for efforts that drive employee engagement and our values.\n\nYou can find more information about the Company's human capital management and related initiatives in our 2023-2024 Purpose &amp; Impact Report and on the 'Our Purpose &amp; Impact' section of the Company's website.\n\n## People\n\nCompany employees, which include those in the Company's corporate and other offices as well as in Company-owned and operated restaurants, totaled over 150,000 worldwide as of year-end 2024, of which approximately 70% were based outside of the U.S. In addition to Company employees, the over two million individuals who work in M cDonald's franchised restaurants around the world are critical to the Company's success, enabling it to drive long-term value creation and further its purpose and mission. People are at the cornerstone of the Company's business and an essential part of the System.\n\n## Commitment to Inclusion\n\nInclusion is one of the Company's core values, which it strives to integrate into business operations to deliver an inclusive experience for stakeholders-including employees, franchisees, suppliers, customers and the communities in which the Company operates.\n\nGrounded in the Company's values, the Company believes in treating everyone with dignity, fairness and respect, always. There are four guiding principles the Company applies to evaluate its work: (i) our system thrives when we are shaped by the communities in which we operate, (ii) our early and full adoption of inclusion gives us a competitive advantage, (iii) individuals perform their best when they feel they belong and (iv) our priority is to be a responsible business, acting lawfully and being responsive to the business environment.\n\n## Safe &amp; Respectful Workplaces\n\nThe Company believes that it has a responsibility to help protect the health and safety of anyone who works at or enters a M cDonald's restaurant, a concept that is incorporated into Company policies, codes of conduct and guiding principles. The Company is committed to promoting safety in all of the Company's corporate and other offices and Company-owned and operated restaurants, as well as supporting franchisees to do the same in the restaurants they own and operate. The Company also works to foster respectful workplaces, where people can be themselves without fear of harassment, discrimination, retaliation or violence, and to help its franchisees do the same in their workplaces.\n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2024 Annual R eport 4",

      "question": "How has McDonald's relationship with franchisees evolved in terms of real estate ownership and co-investment strategy between 2022 and 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2022, McDonald's emphasized Systemwide coordination and alignment to manage ESG initiatives, including environmental sustainability and responsible sourcing, which required franchisee cooperation. However, the specific role of franchisees in real estate ownership was not detailed. By 2024, the company explicitly outlined its conventional franchise model, where it typically owns or secures long-term leases on land and buildings, while franchisees invest in equipment, signs, seating, and d\u00e9cor. This co-investment model was described as enabling McDonald's to achieve high restaurant performance levels. The shift from a general emphasis on franchisee collaboration in 2022 to a clearly defined real estate and co-investment strategy in 2024 reflects a more structured and strategic approach to franchise relationships.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, McDonald's highlighted the importance of franchisee alignment for ESG initiatives but did not specify franchisee involvement in real estate or investment responsibilities.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, McDonald's detailed its conventional franchise model, specifying that the company typically owns or secures real estate while franchisees invest in other capital assets, framing this as key to performance.",
        "Step 3: The evolution from general collaboration to a clearly articulated co-investment model indicates a strategic shift in how McDonald's positions franchisees in real estate and capital investment."

          "chunk_text": "## Our business is subject to an increasing focus on ESG matters.\n\nIn recent years, there has been an increasing focus by stakeholders - including employees, franchisees, customers, suppliers, governmental and non-governmental organizations and investors - on ESG matters. A failure, whether real or perceived, to address ESG matters or to achieve progress on our ESG initiatives could adversely affect our business, including by heightening other risks disclosed in these Risk Factors, such as those related to consumer behavior, consumer perceptions of our brand, labor availability and costs, supply chain interruptions, commodity costs, and legal and regulatory complexity. Conversely, our taking a position, whether real or perceived, on ESG, public policy, geopolitical and similar matters could adversely impact our business.\n\nThe standards we set for ourselves regarding ESG matters, and our ability to meet such standards, may also impact our business. For example, we are working to manage risks and costs to our System related to climate change, greenhouse gases, and diminishing energy and water resources, and we have announced initiatives relating to, among other things, environmental sustainability, responsible sourcing and increasing diverse representation across our System. We may face increased scrutiny related to reporting on and achieving these initiatives, as well as continued public focus on similar matters, such as packaging and waste, animal health and welfare, deforestation and land use. We may also face increased pressure from stakeholders to provide expanded disclosure and establish additional commitments, targets or goals, and take actions to meet them, which could expose us to additional market, operational, execution and reputational costs and risks. Moreover, addressing ESG matters requires Systemwide coordination and alignment, and the standards by which certain ESG matters are measured are evolving and subject to assumptions that could change over time.\n\n## Events such as severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, among others, can adversely affect our results and prospects.\n\nSevere weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, climate change or terrorist activities (or expectations about them) can adversely affect consumer behavior and confidence levels, supply availability and costs and local operations in impacted markets, all of which can affect our results and prospects. Climate change may also increase the frequency and severity of such weather-related events and natural disasters. Our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to some of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to cover our losses fully.\n\n## LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n\nThe Company has pending a number of lawsuits that have been filed in various jurisdictions. These lawsuits cover a broad variety of allegations spanning the Company's business. The following is a brief description of the more significant types of such claims and lawsuits. In addition, the Company is subject to various national and local laws and regulations that impact various aspects of its business, as discussed under 'Government Regulations' below. While the Company does not believe that any such claims, lawsuits, laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations, unfavorable rulings could occur. Were an unfavorable ruling to occur, it could result in a material adverse impact on the Company's net income for the period in which it occurs and/or future periods.\n\n## \u25aa Franchising\n\nA substantial number of McDonald's restaurants are franchised to independent owner/operators and developmental licensees under contractual arrangements with the Company. In the course of the franchise relationship, occasional disputes arise between the Company and its current or former franchisees relating to a broad range of subjects, including, but not limited to, quality, service and cleanliness issues, menu pricing, contentions regarding franchise grants or terminations, alleged discrimination, delinquent payments of rents and fees and claims for additional franchises or franchise renewals. Occasional disputes also arise between the Company and individuals who claim they should have been granted a franchise or who challenge the legal distinction between the Company and its franchisees for employment law purposes.\n\n## \u25aa Suppliers\n\nThe Company and its affiliates and subsidiaries generally do not supply food, paper or related items to any McDonald's restaurants. The Company relies upon numerous independent suppliers, including service providers, that are required to meet and maintain the Company's high standards and specifications. On occasion, disputes arise between the Company and its current or former suppliers relating to, for example, compliance with product specifications and the Company's business relationship with suppliers. Occasional disputes also arise between the Company and individuals or entities who claim that they should be (or should have been) granted the opportunity to supply products or services to the Company's restaurants.\n\n## \u25aa Employees\n\nHundreds of thousands of people are employed by the Company and in restaurants owned and operated by subsidiaries of the Company. In addition, thousands of people from time to time seek employment in such restaurants. In the ordinary course of business, disputes occasionally arise regarding hiring, termination, promotion and pay practices, including, but not limited to, wage and hour disputes, alleged discrimination and compliance with labor and employment laws.\n\n## \u25aa Customers\n\nMcDonald's restaurants - whether owned by subsidiaries of the Company, independent owner/operators or developmental licensees - regularly serve a broad segment of the public. In so doing, disputes occasionally arise as to products, service, incidents, pricing, advertising, nutritional and other disclosures, as well as other matters common to an extensive restaurant business such as that of the Company.",

Refer to the Segment and Geographic Information section on page 52 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\n\n## DESCRIPTION OF THE  B U SIN E SS\n\nThe Company franchises and owns and operates M cDonald's restaurants, which serve a locally relevant menu of quality food and beverages in communities across more than 100 countries. Of the 43,477 M cDonald's restaurants at year-end 2024, approximately 95% were franchised.\n\nThe Company's reporting segments are aligned with its strategic priorities and reflect how management reviews and evaluates operating performance. Significant reportable segments include the United States (\"U.S.\") and International Operated M arkets. In addition, there is the International Developmental Licensed Markets &amp; Corporate segment, which includes the results of over 75 countries as well as Corporate activities.\n\nMcDonald's franchised restaurants are owned and operated under one of the following structures - conventional franchise, developmental license or affiliate. The optimal ownership structure for an individual restaurant, trading area or market (country) is based on a variety of factors, including the availability of individuals with entrepreneurial experience and financial resources, as well as the local legal and regulatory environment in critical areas such as property ownership and franchising. The business relationship between the Company and its independent franchisees is supported by adhering to standards and policies, including McDonald's Global Brand Standards, and is of fundamental importance to overall performance and to protecting the M cDonald's brand.\n\nThe Company is primarily a franchisor and believes franchising is paramount to delivering great-tasting food, locally relevant customer experiences and driving profitability . Franchising enables an individual to be their own employer and maintain control over all employment related matters, marketing and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the strength of M cDonald's global brand, operating system and financial resources.\n\nDirectly operating M cDonald's restaurants contributes significantly to the Company's ability to act as a credible franchisor. One of the strengths of the franchising model is that the expertise from Company-owned and operated restaurants allows M cDonald's to improve the operations and success of all restaurants while innovations from franchisees can be tested and, when viable, efficiently implemented across relevant restaurants. Having Company-owned and operated restaurants provides Company personnel with a venue for restaurant operations training experience. In addition, in our Company-owned and operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, the Company is able to further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies.\n\nThe Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-owned and operated restaurants and fees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment, if any, and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms. The Company's Other revenues are comprised of fees paid by franchisees to recover a portion of costs incurred by the Company for various technology platforms, revenues from brand licensing arrangements to market and sell consumer packaged goods using the M cDonald's brand and, for periods prior to its sale on A pril 1, 2022, third-party revenues for the Company's Dynamic Yield business.\n\n## Conventional Franchise\n\nUnder a conventional franchise arrangement, the Company generally owns or secures a long-term lease on the land and building for the restaurant location and the franchisee pays for equipment, signs, seating and d\u00e9cor. The Company believes that ownership of real estate, combined with the co-investment by franchisees, enables it to achieve restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry.",

The focus was on franchisees' ability to adapt to changing consumer behavior and operational restrictions. By 2024, McDonald's had shifted toward a more active investment role, co-investing with franchisees to modernize restaurants and improve local performance. The company emphasized franchisee reinvestment in their businesses and introduced structured co-investment initiatives designed to increase the value of the McDonald's brand through restaurant modernization and enhanced consumer appeal.

          "chunk_text": "## RISK FACTORS\n\nOur business results are subject to a variety of risks, including those that are described below and elsewhere in our filings with the SEC. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business. If any of these risks materialize or intensify, our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change and our performance may be adversely affected.\n\n## GLOBAL PANDEMIC\n\n## The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected and is expected to continue to adversely affect our financial results, condition and outlook.\n\nHealth epidemics or pandemics can adversely affect consumer spending and confidence levels and supply availability and costs, as well as the local operations in impacted markets, all of which can affect our financial results, condition and outlook. Importantly, the global pandemic resulting from COVID-19 has disrupted global health, economic and market conditions, consumer behavior and McDonald's global restaurant operations since early 2020, and has resulted in increased pressure on labor availability and supply chain management. Local and national governmental mandates or recommendations and public perceptions of the risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have caused, and we expect will continue to cause, consumer behavior to change, worsening or volatile economic conditions in certain markets, and increased regulatory complexity and compliance costs, each of which could continue to adversely affect our business. In addition, our global operations have been disrupted to varying degrees in different markets and may continue to be disrupted to varying degrees given the unpredictability of the virus, its resurgences and variants and government responses thereto as well as potentially permanent changes to the industry in which we operate. While we cannot predict the duration or scope of the COVID-19 pandemic, the resurgence of infections or the emergence of new variants in one or more markets, the availability, acceptance or effectiveness of vaccines or vaccination rates across the globe, the pandemic has negatively impacted our business and is expected to continue to impact our financial results, condition and outlook in a way that may be material.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may also heighten other risks disclosed in these Risk Factors, including, but not limited to, those related to labor availability and costs, supply chain interruptions, commodity costs, consumer behavior, consumer perceptions of our brand and competition.\n\n## STRATEGY AND BRAND\n\n## If we do not successfully evolve and execute against our business strategies, including the Accelerating the Arches strategy, we may not be able to drive business growth.\n\nTo drive Systemwide sales, operating income and free cash flow growth, our business strategies must be effective in maintaining and strengthening customer appeal and capturing additional market share. Whether these strategies are successful depends mainly on our System's ability to:\n\n- capitalize on our global scale, iconic brand and local market presence to build upon our historic strengths and competitive advantages, such as our marketing, core menu items and digital, delivery and drive thru;\n- continue to innovate and differentiate the McDonald's experience, including by preparing and serving our food in a way that balances value and convenience to our customers with profitability;\n- accelerate technology investments for a fast and easy customer experience;\n- continue to run great restaurants by driving efficiencies and expanding capacities while continuing to prioritize health and safety;\n- identify and develop restaurant sites consistent with our plans for net growth of Systemwide restaurants;\n- accelerate our existing strategies, including through growth opportunities and potential acquisitions, investments and partnerships; and\n- evolve and adjust our business strategies in response to, among other things, changing consumer behavior, operational restrictions and impacts to our results of operations and liquidity, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIf we are delayed or unsuccessful in executing our strategies, or if our strategies do not yield the desired results, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\n\n## Failure to preserve the value and relevance of our brand could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\n\nTo be successful in the future, we believe we must preserve, enhance and leverage the value of our brand, including our corporate purpose, mission and values. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions, which are affected by a variety of factors, including the nutritional content and preparation of our food, the ingredients we use, the manner in which we source commodities and general business practices across the System, including the people practices at McDonald's restaurants. Consumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons, and some changes can occur rapidly. For example, nutritional, health, environmental and other scientific studies and conclusions, which constantly evolve and may have contradictory implications, drive popular opinion, litigation and regulation (including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior) in ways that affect the 'informal eating out' ('IEO') segment or perceptions of our brand, generally or relative to available alternatives. Our business could also be impacted by business incidents or practices, whether actual or perceived, particularly if they receive considerable publicity or result in litigation, as well as by our position or perceived lack of position on environmental, social responsibility, public policy, geopolitical and similar matters. Consumer perceptions may also be affected by adverse commentary from third parties, including through social media or conventional media outlets, regarding the quick-service category of the IEO segment or our brand, culture, operations, suppliers or franchisees. If we are unsuccessful in addressing adverse commentary or perceptions, whether or not accurate, our brand and financial results may suffer.",

          "chunk_text": "Franchisees are responsible for reinvesting capital in their businesses over time. In addition, to accelerate implementation of certain initiatives, the Company may co-invest with franchisees to fund improvements to their restaurants or operating systems. These investments, developed in collaboration with franchisees, are designed to cater to consumer preferences, improve local business performance and increase the value of the M cDonald's brand through the development of modernized, more attractive and higher revenue generating restaurants.\n\nThe Company requires franchisees to meet rigorous standards and generally does not work with passive investors. The business relationship with franchisees is designed to facilitate consistency and high quality at all M cDonald's restaurants. Conventional franchisees contribute to the Company's revenue, primarily through the payment of rent and royalties based upon a percent of sales, with specified minimum rent payments, along with initial fees paid upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new franchise. The Company's heavily franchised business model is designed to generate stable and predictable revenue, which is largely a function of franchisee sales, and resulting cash flow streams.\n\n## Developmental License or Affiliate\n\nUnder a developmental license or affiliate arrangement, licensees are responsible for operating and managing their businesses, providing capital (including the real estate interest) and developing and opening new restaurants. The Company generally does not invest any restaurant capital under a developmental license or affiliate arrangement, and it receives a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally receives initial fees upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new license.\n\nWhile developmental license and affiliate arrangements are largely the same, affiliate arrangements are used in a limited number of foreign markets (primarily China and Japan) within the International Developmental Licensed M arkets &amp; Corporate segment as well as a limited number of individual restaurants within the International Operated M arkets segment, where the Company also has an equity investment and records its share of net results in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates.\n\n## PURPOSE, MISSION AND VALUE S\n\nThrough its size and scale, M cDonald's embraces and prioritizes its role and commitment to the communities in which it operates through its purpose to feed and foster communities, and its mission to make delicious feel-good moments easy for everyone. The Company is guided by five core values that define who it is and how it runs the business across the three-legged stool of M cDonald's franchisees, suppliers, and employees:\n\n1. Serve - We put our customers and people first;\n2. Inclusion - We open our doors to everyone;\n3. Integrity - We do the right thing;\n4. Community - We are good neighbors; and\n5. Family - We get better together.\n\nThe Company believes that its people, all around the world, set it apart and bring these values to life daily.\n\n## HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\nThe Company's people strategies aim to support an inclusive environment that represents the communities in which it operates. To do this, the Company offers quality training and learning opportunities and upholds high standards of health and safety designed to create and maintain a safe and respectful workplace for its employees. In support of the Company's values, the Company's annual incentive plan holds the Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") and Executive Officers accountable for efforts that drive employee engagement and our values.\n\nYou can find more information about the Company's human capital management and related initiatives in our 2023-2024 Purpose &amp; Impact Report and on the 'Our Purpose &amp; Impact' section of the Company's website.\n\n## People\n\nCompany employees, which include those in the Company's corporate and other offices as well as in Company-owned and operated restaurants, totaled over 150,000 worldwide as of year-end 2024, of which approximately 70% were based outside of the U.S. In addition to Company employees, the over two million individuals who work in M cDonald's franchised restaurants around the world are critical to the Company's success, enabling it to drive long-term value creation and further its purpose and mission. People are at the cornerstone of the Company's business and an essential part of the System.\n\n## Commitment to Inclusion\n\nInclusion is one of the Company's core values, which it strives to integrate into business operations to deliver an inclusive experience for stakeholders-including employees, franchisees, suppliers, customers and the communities in which the Company operates.\n\nGrounded in the Company's values, the Company believes in treating everyone with dignity, fairness and respect, always. There are four guiding principles the Company applies to evaluate its work: (i) our system thrives when we are shaped by the communities in which we operate, (ii) our early and full adoption of inclusion gives us a competitive advantage, (iii) individuals perform their best when they feel they belong and (iv) our priority is to be a responsible business, acting lawfully and being responsive to the business environment.\n\n## Safe &amp; Respectful Workplaces\n\nThe Company believes that it has a responsibility to help protect the health and safety of anyone who works at or enters a M cDonald's restaurant, a concept that is incorporated into Company policies, codes of conduct and guiding principles. The Company is committed to promoting safety in all of the Company's corporate and other offices and Company-owned and operated restaurants, as well as supporting franchisees to do the same in the restaurants they own and operate. The Company also works to foster respectful workplaces, where people can be themselves without fear of harassment, discrimination, retaliation or violence, and to help its franchisees do the same in their workplaces.\n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2024 Annual R eport 4",

      "answer": "In 2022, McDonald's described its relationship with franchisees in neutral, structural terms, emphasizing the division of responsibilities such as franchised arrangements and license agreements, and presenting franchisees as co-participants in operating restaurants. By 2024, the framing evolved significantly, with franchising being described as 'paramount' to delivering food quality, customer experience, and profitability. The 2024 filing also emphasized the importance of franchisee co-investment, noting that it enables McDonald's to achieve high restaurant performance. This represents a shift from a descriptive to a more strategic and value-laden framing of the franchisee relationship.",

Refer to the Segment and Geographic Information section on page 52 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\n\n## DESCRIPTION OF THE  B U SIN E SS\n\nThe Company franchises and owns and operates M cDonald's restaurants, which serve a locally relevant menu of quality food and beverages in communities across more than 100 countries. Of the 43,477 M cDonald's restaurants at year-end 2024, approximately 95% were franchised.\n\nThe Company's reporting segments are aligned with its strategic priorities and reflect how management reviews and evaluates operating performance. Significant reportable segments include the United States (\"U.S.\") and International Operated M arkets. In addition, there is the International Developmental Licensed Markets &amp; Corporate segment, which includes the results of over 75 countries as well as Corporate activities.\n\nMcDonald's franchised restaurants are owned and operated under one of the following structures - conventional franchise, developmental license or affiliate. The optimal ownership structure for an individual restaurant, trading area or market (country) is based on a variety of factors, including the availability of individuals with entrepreneurial experience and financial resources, as well as the local legal and regulatory environment in critical areas such as property ownership and franchising. The business relationship between the Company and its independent franchisees is supported by adhering to standards and policies, including McDonald's Global Brand Standards, and is of fundamental importance to overall performance and to protecting the M cDonald's brand.\n\nThe Company is primarily a franchisor and believes franchising is paramount to delivering great-tasting food, locally relevant customer experiences and driving profitability . Franchising enables an individual to be their own employer and maintain control over all employment related matters, marketing and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the strength of M cDonald's global brand, operating system and financial resources.\n\nDirectly operating M cDonald's restaurants contributes significantly to the Company's ability to act as a credible franchisor. One of the strengths of the franchising model is that the expertise from Company-owned and operated restaurants allows M cDonald's to improve the operations and success of all restaurants while innovations from franchisees can be tested and, when viable, efficiently implemented across relevant restaurants. Having Company-owned and operated restaurants provides Company personnel with a venue for restaurant operations training experience. In addition, in our Company-owned and operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, the Company is able to further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies.\n\nThe Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-owned and operated restaurants and fees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment, if any, and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms. The Company's Other revenues are comprised of fees paid by franchisees to recover a portion of costs incurred by the Company for various technology platforms, revenues from brand licensing arrangements to market and sell consumer packaged goods using the M cDonald's brand and, for periods prior to its sale on A pril 1, 2022, third-party revenues for the Company's Dynamic Yield business.\n\n## Conventional Franchise\n\nUnder a conventional franchise arrangement, the Company generally owns or secures a long-term lease on the land and building for the restaurant location and the franchisee pays for equipment, signs, seating and d\u00e9cor. The Company believes that ownership of real estate, combined with the co-investment by franchisees, enables it to achieve restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry.",

In order to be successful, we will need to implement, maintain and ramp efficient and cost-effective manufacturing capabilities, processes and supply chains and achieve the design tolerances, high quality and output rates we have planned at our manufacturing facilities in California, Nevada, Texas, China, Germany and any future sites such as Mexico. We will also need to hire, train and compensate skilled employees to operate these facilities. Bottlenecks and other unexpected challenges such as those we experienced in the past may arise during our production ramps, and we must address them promptly while continuing to improve manufacturing processes and reducing costs. If we are not successful in achieving these goals, we could face delays in establishing and/or sustaining our product ramps or be unable to meet our related cost and profitability targets.\n\nWe have experienced, and may also experience similar future delays in launching and/or ramping production of our energy storage products and Solar Roof; new product versions or variants; new vehicles; and future products, features and services based on artificial intelligence. Likewise, we may encounter delays with the design, construction and regulatory or other approvals necessary to build and bring online future manufacturing facilities and products. In addition, as we continue to develop our artificial intelligence services and products, we may face many additional challenges, including the availability and cost of energy, processing power limitations and the substantial power requirements for our data centers.\n\nAny delay or other complication in ramping the production of our current products or the development, manufacture, launch and production ramp of our future products, features and services, or in doing so cost-effectively and with high quality, may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Our suppliers may fail to deliver components according to schedules, prices, quality and volumes that are acceptable to us, or we may be unable to manage these components effectively.\n\nOur products contain thousands of parts purchased globally from hundreds of suppliers, including single-source direct suppliers, which exposes us to multiple potential sources of component shortages. Unexpected changes in business conditions, materials pricing, including inflation of raw material costs, labor issues, wars, trade policies, natural disasters, health epidemics, trade and shipping disruptions, port congestions, cyberattacks and other factors beyond our or our suppliers' control could also affect these suppliers' ability to deliver technologies or components to us or to remain solvent and operational. Additionally, if our suppliers do not accurately forecast and effectively allocate production or if they are not willing to allocate sufficient production to us, or face other challenges such as insolvency, it may reduce our access to components and require us to search for new suppliers. The unavailability of any component or supplier could result in production delays, idle manufacturing facilities, product design changes and loss of access to important technology and tools for producing and supporting our products, as well as impact our capacity expansion and our ability to fulfill our obligations under customer contracts. Moreover, significant increases in our production or product design changes by us have required and may in the future require us to procure additional components in a short amount of time. We have faced in the past, and may face suppliers who are unwilling or unable to sustainably meet our timelines or our cost, quality and volume needs, which may increase our costs or require us to replace them with other sources. Finally, as we construct new manufacturing facilities and add production lines to existing facilities, we may experience issues in correspondingly increasing the level of localized procurement at those facilities. While we believe that we will be able to secure additional or alternate sources or develop our own replacements for most of our components, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so quickly or at all. Additionally, we may be unsuccessful in our continuous efforts to negotiate with existing suppliers to obtain cost reductions and avoid unfavorable changes to terms, source less expensive suppliers for certain parts and redesign certain parts to make them less expensive to produce, especially in the case of increases in materials pricing. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\nAs the scale of our vehicle production increases, we will also need to accurately forecast, purchase, warehouse and transport components at high volumes to our manufacturing facilities and servicing locations internationally. If we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantities of component purchases to our actual needs or successfully implement automation, inventory management and other systems to accommodate the increased complexity in our supply chain and parts management, we may incur unexpected production disruption, storage, transportation and write-off costs, which may harm our business and operating results.\n\n## We may be unable to meet our projected construction timelines, costs and production ramps at new factories, or we may experience difficulties in generating and maintaining demand for products manufactured there.\n\nOur ability to increase production of our vehicles on a sustained basis, make them affordable globally by accessing local supply chains and workforces and streamline delivery logistics is dependent on the construction and ramp of our current and future factories.

      "answer": "In 2023, Tesla emphasized the engineering and design maturity of the Solar Roof, highlighting its aesthetic appeal, durability, and integration with Powerwall. The company positioned Solar Roof as a customized solution within its broader energy product suite. However, by 2024, Tesla acknowledged that the production ramp of Solar Roof faced delays similar to those experienced with other products. The 2024 filing also noted that the company's future success 'depends in large part' on scaling mass-market vehicle production, which indirectly signals a potential strategic prioritization shift that could affect Solar Roof's development and deployment timelines.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, Tesla described Solar Roof as a mature, engineered product with aesthetic and functional integration into its energy ecosystem.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, Tesla reported potential delays in launching and ramping Solar Roof production and indicated that its business depends heavily on vehicle production scalability.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a shift from confident product positioning to acknowledging production bottlenecks and strategic dependencies, suggesting a more complex or evolving path for Solar Roof."

      "answer": "In 2023, Tesla's free Supercharging programs were included under Automotive Sales Revenue as part of the revenue associated with new vehicle deliveries, indicating they were bundled with vehicle sales and recognized over time. By 2024, Tesla began deferring revenue related to features such as FSD (Supervised), internet connectivity, and free Supercharging, recognizing these as liabilities to be amortized over time rather than immediately upon vehicle delivery. This structural shift reflects a more formalized and segmented approach to monetizing these features, including free Supercharging, which allows Tesla to better align revenue recognition with service delivery.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, free Supercharging was included in Automotive Sales Revenue, bundled with vehicle sales and recognized as part of the vehicle delivery process.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Amazon highlighted that shipping costs were expected to increase as customers increasingly adopted its shipping offers, used faster delivery methods, and as the company expanded its fulfillment network. Shipping costs in 2021 were $76.7 billion, and the company anticipated continued growth in these costs. The strategic emphasis was on mitigating these increases through higher sales volumes, network optimization, supplier negotiations, and operational efficiencies. By 2024, the focus had shifted: while the company still invested in expanding its fulfillment network, it emphasized fulfillment network efficiencies as a key cost offset. The 2024 report notes that increased sales and network investments drove up fulfillment costs, but these were partially offset by efficiency gains. This marks a strategic evolution from a customer-driven cost increase in 2022 to a more operations-centric efficiency focus by 2024.",

Shipping costs, which include sortation and delivery centers and transportation costs, were $61.1 billion and $76.7 billion in 2020 and 2021. We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we use more expensive shipping methods, including faster delivery, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.\n\nCosts to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as 'Technology and content' as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers.\n\n## Fulfillment\n\nFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, physical stores, and customer service centers and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in 'Fulfillment,' AWS costs are primarily classified as 'Technology and",

Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, the ex tent to which third-party sellers utilize Fulfillment by Amazon services, timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix  of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, sales by our sellers have higher payment processing and related transaction costs as a percentage of net sales compared to our retail sales because payment processing costs are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions.\n\nThe increase in fulfillment costs in 2024, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased sales and investments in our fulfillment network, partially offset by fulfillment network efficiencies. Changes in foreign ex change rates reduced fulfillment costs by $223 million in 2024.\n\nWe seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements.\n\n## Technology and Infrastructure\n\nTechnology and infrastructure costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers, including expenditures related to initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices and the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services.\n\nWe seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and infrastructure so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and infrastructure investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in technology and infrastructure to increase over time as we continue to add employees and infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and infrastructure costs in 2024, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to an increase in spending on infrastructure, partially offset by decreased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for ex panding our ex isting products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings and a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense from our change in the estimated useful life of our servers. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced technology and infrastructure costs by $244 million in 2024. We currently expense the majority of the costs associated with the development of our satellite network for global broadband service (including production, launch, and payroll costs, and launch services deposits upon launch). We will capitalize certain of these costs once the service achieves commercial viability, including sales to customers.\n\n## Sales and Marketing\n\nSales and marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, third-party customer referrals, social and online advertising, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the ex tent our mix  of these channels shifts, we would ex pect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs.\n\nThe decrease in sales and marketing costs in 2024, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to decreased payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, partially offset by increased advertising ex penses. Changes in foreign ex change rates reduced sales and marketing costs by $263 million in 2024.\n\nWhile costs associated with Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in sales and marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely.",

      "question": "How has Amazon's utilization and structure of its short-term credit facilities evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of credit capacity, interest rate terms, and outstanding borrowings?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Amazon had a $7.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with an interest rate of benchmark rate plus 0.50% and a commitment fee of 0.04%, and no borrowings were outstanding under this facility. Additionally, Amazon had $7.2 billion in unused letters of credit as of December 31, 2021. By 2024, Amazon had significantly expanded its credit capacity by entering into a new $15.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a lower interest rate of benchmark rate plus 0.45% and a reduced commitment fee of 0.03%. In addition, Amazon introduced a new $5.0 billion unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility in October 2024, which also carried a rate of SOFR plus 0.45% and a 0.03% commitment fee. Notably, there were still no borrowings outstanding under the main Credit Agreement or the Short-Term Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2024. However, Amazon had $147 million and $151 million in borrowings under other short-term credit facilities as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively, which were included in 'Accrued expenses and other.' The company also increased its unused letters of credit to $8.3 billion by the end of 2024.",

        "Step 2: By 2024, Amazon had a new $15.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a lower interest rate of benchmark rate plus 0.45%, and a new $5.0 billion unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility introduced in October 2024. No borrowings were outstanding under these two new agreements as of December 31, 2024, but there were $147 million and $151 million in borrowings under other short-term credit facilities in 2023 and 2024, respectively. Unused letters of credit increased to $8.3 billion by the end of 2024.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a significant transformation in Amazon\u2019s short-term credit structure, with an increase in credit capacity, a reduction in interest and commitment fees, and a slight increase in actual borrowings under other short-term credit facilities. This indicates a strategic evolution in Amazon\u2019s liquidity management and credit utilization approach."

Risk Factors\n\nPlease carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors, events, and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results), cash flows, liquidity, and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. In addition to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions on our business and operations discussed in Item 7 of Part II, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,' and in the risk factors below, the global economic climate and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of the risks discussed below.\n\n## Business and Industry Risks\n\n## We Face Intense Competition\n\nOur businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors across geographies, including cross-border competition, and in different industries, including physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, e-commerce services, web and infrastructure computing services, electronic devices, digital content, advertising, grocery, and transportation and logistics services. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer geographic regions. They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing.\n\nCompetition continues to intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and wellfunded competitors, and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content, and electronic devices continue to increase our competition. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser known businesses to compete against us. As a result of competition, our product and service offerings may not be successful, we may fail to gain or may lose business, and we may be required to increase our spending or lower prices, any of which could materially reduce our sales and profits.\n\n## Our Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Risks\n\nWe may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our product or service offerings. These offerings, which can present new and difficult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues. In addition, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may not meet our expectations, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them. Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the value of those investments being written down or written off. In addition, our sustainability initiatives may be unsuccessful for a variety of reasons, including if we are unable to realize the expected benefits of new technologies or if we do not successfully plan or execute new strategies, which could harm our business or damage our reputation.\n\n## Our International Operations Expose Us to a Number of Risks\n\nOur international activities are significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. In certain international market segments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish, develop, and maintain international operations and stores, and promote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not become profitable on a sustained basis.\n\nIn addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\n- local economic and political conditions;\n- government regulation (such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition); restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs); nationalization; and restrictions on foreign ownership;\n- restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, services, and content, including uncertainty as a result of less Internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal",

      "answer": "In 2022, Starbucks reported an interest rate swap liability of $34.0 million under 'Other long-term liabilities'. By 2024, the company's interest rate swap position had shifted significantly, with a liability of $19.2 million under 'Other long-term liabilities' and an additional $41.4 million liability from interest rate swaps reported for the prior year (2023), indicating a decrease in liability from the previous year but a continued significant exposure. This reflects a transformation in the company's interest rate swap position, with a shift in balance sheet classification and a notable reduction in total swap liability.",

        "Step 1: Identify the state of interest rate swap exposure in 2022, which was reported as $34.0 million under 'Other long-term liabilities'.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Starbucks reported an inventory value of roasted coffee at $310.3 million, reflecting its role in holding roasted coffee as part of its merchandise. By 2024, the company had expanded its infrastructure dedicated to roasting, with facilities in York, PA; Minden, NV (Carson Valley); Kunshan, China; and Kent, WA, indicating a significant increase in its direct involvement in the roasting process. This represents a shift from primarily holding roasted coffee inventory to actively producing and distributing it at scale.",

        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in 2022 - Starbucks disclosed roasted coffee as part of its inventory with a value of $310.3 million, indicating it held roasted coffee for sale but did not emphasize production.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in 2024 - Starbucks operates multiple large-scale facilities dedicated to roasting, including locations in York, PA; Minden, NV; Kunshan, China; and Kent, WA, showing a significant investment in roasted coffee production.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - Starbucks transitioned from primarily holding roasted coffee inventory to actively producing it, reflecting a strategic shift in its involvement with the product."

      "question": "How did Starbucks' foreign currency - other derivative liabilities and their impact on net gains/(losses) included in AOCI evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's exposure to foreign currency fluctuations?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Starbucks reported foreign currency - other derivative liabilities of $0.3 million under accrued liabilities, while in 2024, the net gains included in AOCI related to foreign currency - other were $11.5 million. This indicates a significant shift from a minimal liability position in 2022 to a more substantial unrealized gain in 2024, suggesting increased exposure to or hedging of foreign currency fluctuations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Starbucks disclosed a $0.3 million derivative liability related to foreign currency - other under accrued liabilities.",
        "Step 2: By 2024, the company reported $11.5 million in net gains included in AOCI for foreign currency - other, indicating a significant unrealized gain and increased derivative activity.",
        "Step 3: The change from a small liability to a notable unrealized gain shows a transformation in the company's foreign currency derivative strategy, likely reflecting increased exposure or hedging efforts."

      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, Nike disclosed that the estimated cost of inventory for expected product returns was $269 million, and these reserves were recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets. By fiscal 2024, while the specific dollar amount of the product return reserve was not disclosed, Nike described a more formalized estimation process, stating that it calculates anticipated reductions in revenue\u2014such as sales returns\u2014by determining the 'most likely amount' it will be entitled to receive. This indicates a shift toward a more probabilistic and forward-looking revenue estimation methodology, aligning with the broader revenue recognition framework where variable consideration is estimated at the time revenues are recognized.",

        "In 2022, Nike explicitly reported a $269 million inventory reserve for expected product returns, indicating a more historical or experience-based estimation method.",

N IKE , Inc. portfolio brands include the N IKE  Brand, Jordan Brand and C onverse. T he N IKE  Brand is focused on perform ance athletic footwear, apparel, equipm ent, accessories and services across M en's, W om en's and Kids', am plified with sport-inspired lifestyle products carrying the Swoosh tradem ark, as well as other N IKE  Brand tradem arks. T he Jordan Brand is focused on athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories using the Jum pm an tradem ark. Sales and operating results of Jordan Brand products are reported within the respective N IKE  Brand geographic operating segm ents. C onverse designs, distributes, licenses and sells casual sneakers, apparel and accessories under the C onverse, C huck Taylor, All Star, O ne Star, Star C hevron and Jack P urcell tradem arks. In som e m arkets outside the U .S., these tradem arks are licensed to third parties who design, distribute, m arket and sell sim ilar products. O perating results of the C onverse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis.\n\n## BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statem ents include the accounts of N IKE , Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"C om pany\" or \"N IKE \"). All significant intercom pany transactions and balances have been elim inated.\n\n## MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES\n\nThe preparation of financial statem ents in conform ity with generally accepted accounting principles requires m anagem ent to m ake estim ates, including estim ates relating to assum ptions that affect the reported am ounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statem ents and the reported am ounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from  these estim ates.\n\n## REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nRevenue transactions associated with the sale of N IKE  Brand footwear, apparel and equipm ent, as well as C onverse products, com prise a single perform ance obligation, which consists of the sale of products to custom ers either through wholesale or direct to consum er channels. T he C om pany satisfies the perform ance obligation and records revenues when transfer of control to the custom er has occurred, based on the term s of sale. A custom er is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive substantially all of the benefits of the product.\n\nControl is transferred to wholesale custom ers upon shipm ent or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreem ent with the custom er. C ontrol transfers to retail store custom ers at the tim e of sale and to substantially all digital com m erce custom ers upon shipm ent. T he transaction price is determ ined based upon the invoiced sales price, less anticipated sales returns, discounts and m iscellaneous claim s from  custom ers. P aym ent term s for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or agreem ent with the custom er and paym ent is generally required within 90 days or less of shipm ent to or receipt by the wholesale custom er. P aym ent is due at the tim e of sale for retail store and digital commerce transactions.\n\nConsideration for tradem ark licensing contracts is earned through sales-based or usage-based royalty arrangem ents, and the associated revenues are recognized over the license period.\n\nTaxes assessed by governm ental authorities that are both im posed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, and are collected by the C om pany from  a custom er, are excluded from  R evenues and C ost of sales in the C onsolidated Statem ents of Incom e. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a custom er are accounted for as fulfillm ent costs and are included in C ost of sales when the related revenues are recognized.\n\n## SALES-RELATED RESERVES\n\nConsideration prom ised in the C om pany's contracts with custom ers is variable due to anticipated reductions, such as sales returns, discounts and m iscellaneous claim s from custom ers. The C om pany estim ates the m ost likely am ount it will be entitled to receive and records an anticipated reduction against R evenues, with an offsetting increase to Accrued liabilities at the tim e revenues are recognized. T he estim ated cost of inventory for product returns is recorded in P repaid expenses and other current assets on the C onsolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nThe provision for anticipated sales returns consists of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns. P rovisions for post-invoice sales discounts consist of both contractual program s and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 63",

      "answer": "In 2022, foreign exchange forwards and options had a net gain of $8 million after tax, impacting various income categories such as revenues, cost of sales, and other (income) expense, net. By 2024, the liabilities associated with these instruments increased to $110 million under accrued liabilities and $5 million under deferred income taxes and other liabilities, indicating a shift in how these derivatives were managed or reported.

        "Step 1: In 2022, Nike reported a net gain of $8 million after tax from foreign exchange forwards and options, impacting revenues, cost of sales, and other (income) expense, net.",

        "Step 3: The change indicates a transformation in Nike's hedging strategy, with increased liabilities in 2024 suggesting a more conservative or expanded approach to managing foreign exchange risk, even though the net gains decreased."

      "answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Lowe's maintained the same form of Officer Indemnification Agreement, first filed as Exhibit 10.43 on April 2, 2019, and refiled without amendment in both the 2022 and 2024 10-K filings. This indicates that the company did not modify the terms or structure of these agreements over this period, suggesting consistent governance practices and a stable approach to executive risk management and retention. Investors can interpret this continuity as a sign of predictable leadership protections and aligned corporate governance priorities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Lowe's refiled the Officer Indemnification Agreement as part of its 10-K disclosures, referencing Exhibit 10.31, originally filed on April 2, 2019 (Exhibit 10.43).",
        "Step 2: In 2024, Lowe's again refiled the same Officer Indemnification Agreement, listed as Exhibit 10.23, with no indication of amendments or structural changes since the original 2019 filing.",
        "Step 3: The lack of modification over this period indicates that Lowe's maintained a consistent approach to executive indemnification, signaling stable governance and executive risk management strategy."

      "answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, LOW's inventory shrink reserve increased from $414 million to $427 million, while the LCNRV reserve increased from $168 million to $222 million. In 2024, a 10% change in either the amount of inventory subject to markdown or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the LCNRV reserve calculation would have affected net earnings by approximately $17 million, and a 10% change in the estimated shrinkage rate would have impacted net earnings by approximately $32 million. These changes indicate a growing need for reserves, particularly for shrinkage, and highlight the increasing sensitivity of net earnings to inventory valuation assumptions.",

        "Step 3: Analyze the change in both reserves and their financial implications, noting that the shrink reserve increased moderately while the LCNRV reserve increased significantly, with corresponding effects on net earnings sensitivity."

In addition, we do not believe it will be necessary to repatriate significant cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held in foreign affiliates to fund domestic operations.\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this Annual Report requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  We base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included herein.  We believe that the following accounting policies affect the most significant estimates and management judgments used in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Merchandise Inventory\n\n## Description\n\nWe record an obsolete inventory reserve for the anticipated loss associated with selling inventories below cost.  This reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience.  During 2021, our reserve decreased approximately $14 million to $168 million as of January 28, 2022.\n\nWe also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories.  This reserve is based primarily on actual shrink results from previous physical inventories.  During 2021, the inventory shrink reserve increased approximately $49 million to $414 million as of January 28, 2022, in response to higher volumes and estimated shrinkage rates based on results from previous physical inventories.\n\nIn addition, we receive funds from vendors in the normal course of business, principally as a result of purchase volumes, sales, early payments or promotions of vendors' products.  Generally, these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs that we incurred to sell the vendor's product.  Many of the vendor funds associated with these purchases are earned under agreements that are negotiated on an annual basis or shorter. The funds are recorded as a reduction to the cost of inventory as they are earned. As the related inventory is sold, the amounts are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales. Funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors' products are recorded as an offset to the related expense.\n\n## Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\n\nWe do not believe that our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term, and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practices based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions. However, changes in consumer purchasing patterns or a deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserves.  Likewise, changes in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary, based on the timing and results of physical inventories.  We also apply judgment in the determination of levels of obsolete inventory and assumptions about net realizable value.\n\nFor vendor funds, we develop accrual rates based on the provisions of the agreements in place.  Due to the diversity of the individual vendor agreements, we perform analyses and review historical purchase trends and volumes throughout the year, adjust accrual rates as appropriate and confirm actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are",

This reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience.  During fiscal 2024, our reserve decreased approximately $23 million to $222 million as of January 31, 2025.\n\nWe also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories.  This reserve is based primarily on actual shrink results from previous physical inventories.  During fiscal 2024, the inventory shrink reserve increased approximately $2 million to $427 million as of January 31, 2025.\n\nIn addition, we receive funds from vendors in the normal course of business, principally as a result of purchase volumes, early payments, or sales-based promotions of vendors' products.  Generally, these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs that we incurred to sell the vendor's product.

However, changes in consumer purchasing patterns or a deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserves.  Likewise, changes in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary, based on the timing and results of physical inventories.  We also apply judgment in the determination of obsolete inventory and assumptions about net realizable value.\n\nFor vendor funds, we develop accrual rates based on the provisions of the agreements in place.  Due to the diversity of the individual vendor agreements, we perform analyses and review historical purchase trends and volumes throughout the year, adjust accrual rates as appropriate and confirm actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded.  Amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected purchase volumes, especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met.\n\n## Effect if actual results differ from assumptions\n\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves for inventory during the past three fiscal years.  We believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for both of these inventory reserves.  However, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves. A 10% change in either the amount of inventory subject to markdown or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the calculation of our LCNRV inventory reserve would each have affected net earnings by approximately $17 million for fiscal 2024. A 10% change in the estimated shrinkage rate included in the calculation of our inventory shrink reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately $32 million for fiscal 2024.\n\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize vendor funds during the past three fiscal years.  If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we could be exposed to additional adjustments that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory.

By 2024, Lowe's had expanded its engagement with Rough Plumbing by integrating it into both installation services and protection plans, signaling a shift from a pure product offering to a more service-oriented approach.

Our installed sales model, which separates selling and project administration tasks, allows our sales associates to focus on project selling, while project managers ensure that the details related to installing the products are efficiently ex ecuted.  We are simplifying the process through a team of remote associates that we call our central selling team. This team handles building quotes, answering questions over video or phone call, and providing personalized support to our customers. We are also implementing technology that allows our customers to finalize their installation contract and checkout on lowes.com or mobile application, so they do not need to return to the store. Installed sales, which includes both product and labor, accounted for approximately 5% of total sales in fiscal 2024.\n\n## Lowe's Protection Plans and Repair Services\n\nWe offer extended protection plans for certain products within the Appliances, Kitchens &amp; Bath, D\u00e9cor, Millwork, Rough Plumbing, Electrical, Seasonal &amp; Outdoor Living, Tools, and Hardware categories. These protection plans provide customers with product protection that enhances the coverage offered by the manufacturer's warranty and provide additional benefits and repair services that extend beyond the manufacturer's warranty.\n\n## Seasonality and Working Capital\n\nThe home improvement business in general is subject to seasonal influences, particularly related to the spring selling season.  Historically, we have realized the highest volume of sales during our second fiscal quarter (May, June, and July) and the lowest volume of sales during our fourth fiscal quarter (November, December, and January).  Accordingly, our working capital requirements have historically been greater during our fourth fiscal quarter as we build inventory in anticipation of the spring selling season and as we experience lower fourth fiscal quarter sales volumes.  We fund our working capital requirements primarily through cash flows generated from operations, but also with short-term borrowings, as needed.  For more detailed information, see the Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources section in Item 7, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations', of this Annual Report.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nThe name 'Lowe's' is a registered service mark of one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. We consider this mark and logo and the accompanying goodwill and name recognition to be valuable to our business. This subsidiary owns and maintains various additional registered and unregistered trademarks, service marks and trade names, including private brand product names, such as, 'Kobalt', 'STAINMASTER', and 'allen+roth.' This subsidiary also maintains various Internet domain names that are important to our business, and we also own registered and unregistered copyrights. In addition, we maintain patent portfolios related to some of our products and services and seek to patent or otherwise protect certain innovations that we incorporate into our products, services, or business operations.\n\n## Government Regulation\n\nWe are subject to a wide array of federal, state, and local laws and regulations. We do not currently expect compliance with these laws and regulations to have a material effect on our capital ex penditures, results of operations, and competitive position as compared to prior periods.\n\n## Human Capital\n\nWhen it comes to attracting and retaining top talent, Lowe's strives to be the employer of choice in retail. At Lowe's we are committed to creating valuable career opportunities for our associates, supporting them and the communities where they live, and cultivating a culture that invites and encourages diverse opinions and ideas. We would like our associates to see Lowe's as a 'Home to Possibility' with good jobs, a sense of belonging, and a promising future.\n\nAs a testament to our commitments, in fiscal 2024 we received several notable employer of choice awards, including being named on the Disability:IN National Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion, Fortune's World's Most Admired Companies Specialty Retailer, 2024 Great Place to Work Certified - U.S. and India, Fair360 Top 50 Noteworthy Company for Workplace Fairness, 2024 American Opportunity Index Top 100 Company, and a Best Corporation for Veteran's Business Enterprises of the Year.",

      "question": "How did Lowe's documentation and structure of its Benefit Restoration Plan evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's approach to employee retirement benefits?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Lowe's maintained the Benefit Restoration Plan as part of its defined contribution retirement offerings, supplementing benefits under the 401(k) Plan for employees affected by IRS limitations. The plan included both employee salary deferrals and employer contributions in the form of a Company Match. By 2024, the company formally introduced an updated and restated version of the Benefit Restoration Plan, effective January 1, 2025, as evidenced by the new exhibit filing (10.3) in the 2024 10-K. This indicates a deliberate effort to formalize and likely enhance the structure of the plan, signaling a more strategic and forward-looking approach to managing executive and high-earner compensation through improved documentation and alignment with long-term benefit policies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2022, the Benefit Restoration Plan was described as a maintained plan offering salary deferrals and employer contributions to supplement 401(k) Plan restrictions under the IRS code.",
        "In 2024, the company introduced a newly amended and restated version of the Benefit Restoration Plan, indicating a formal update to the plan\u2019s structure and governance.",
        "The change from a maintained plan to a formally restated and documented plan in 2024 shows a shift toward more structured and transparent benefit planning, likely aimed at better aligning with long-term compensation strategies and regulatory clarity."

The Company's share-based payment expense per share is equal to 15% of the closing price on the date of purchase.  The ESPP is considered a liability award and is measured at fair value at each reporting date, and the share-based payment expense is recognized over the six-month offering period. Under the 2020 ESPP, the Company issued 0.6 million shares of common stock in 2021 and recognized $20 million of share-based payment expense. Under the Former ESPP, the Company issued 0.7 million and 0.8 million shares of common stock in 2020 and 2019, respectively, and recognized $16 million and $13 million of share-based payment expense pursuant to the Former ESPP in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## NOTE 12: Employee Retirement Plans\n\nThe Company maintains a defined contribution retirement plan for eligible employees (the 401(k) Plan).  Eligible employees may participate in the 401(k) Plan the first of the month after thirty days of employment.  The Company makes contributions to the 401(k) Plan each payroll period, based upon a matching formula applied to employee deferrals (the Company Match).  Participants are eligible to receive the Company Match pursuant to the terms of the 401(k) Plan.  The Company Match varies based on how much the employee elects to defer up to a maximum of 4.25% of eligible compensation.  The Company Match is invested identically to employee contributions and is immediately vested.\n\nThe Company maintains a Benefit Restoration Plan to supplement benefits provided under the 401(k) Plan to participants whose benefits are restricted as a result of certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  This plan provides for employee salary deferrals and employer contributions in the form of a Company Match.\n\nThe Company maintains a non-qualified deferred compensation program called the Lowe's Cash Deferral Plan.  This plan is designed to permit certain employees to defer receipt of portions of their compensation, thereby delaying taxation on the deferral amount and on subsequent earnings until the balance is distributed.  This plan does not provide for Company contributions.\n\nThe Company recognized expense associated with these employee retirement plans of $177 million, $175 million, and $175 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.",

Patents generally hav e a term of twenty years from the date they are filed. As our patent portfolio has been built ov er time, the remaining terms of indiv idual patents across our patent portfolio v ary. Although our patents hav e v alue, no single patent is essential to our business. We continuously assess our merchandising departments and product lines for opportunities to expand the assortment of products offered within The Home Depot's portfolio of proprietary and exclusiv e brands.\n\n## COMPETITION AND SEASONALITY\n\nOur industry is highly competitiv e, highly fragmented, and ev olv ing. As a result, we face competition for customers for our products and serv ices from a variety of retailers, suppliers, serv ice prov iders, and distributors and manufacturers that sell products directly to their respectiv e customer bases. These competitors range from traditional brick-and-mortar, to multichannel, to exclusiv ely online, and they include a number of other home improv ement retailers; local, regional and national hardware stores; electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses; and lumber yards. With respect to some products and serv ices, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, paint stores, specialty and mass digital retailers, warehouse clubs, MRO distributors, national and local wholesale supply distributors, home d\u00e9cor retailers, and other retailers, as well as with prov iders of home improv ement serv ices and tool and equipment rental. The internet facilitates competitiv e entry, price transparency, and comparison shopping, increasing the lev el of competition we face.\n\nBoth in-store and online, we compete primarily based on customer experience; price; quality; product av ailability, assortment, and innov ation; and deliv ery options and capabilities. We also compete based on store and branch location and appearance, presentation of merchandise, and ease of shopping experience throughout ev ery step of the project, from inspiration and research to any post-purchase support. Our Pros also look for dedicated sales support, competitiv e credit and pricing options, project planning tools, and product depth and job-lot quantities, particularly for their complex purchase needs. Furthermore, with respect to deliv ery options, customers are seeking faster and/or guaranteed deliv ery times, low-price or free shipping, and/or conv enient pickup options. Our ability to be competitiv e on deliv ery and pickup times, options and costs depends on many factors, including the success of our supply chain inv estments, described more fully under 'Our Supply Chain' below, and our interconnected retail strategy.\n\nOur business is subject to seasonal influences. Generally, our highest v olume of sales occurs in our second fiscal quarter, as we mov e into the spring season in the regions in which we operate.\n\n## INTERCONNECTED SHOPPING EXPERIENCE\n\nWe continue to enhance our capabilities to prov ide our customers with a frictionless interconnected shopping experience across our stores, branches, online, on the job site, and in their homes, focusing on continued inv estments in our websites and mobile apps to enhance the customer experience.\n\n## Digital Experience\n\nEnhancements to our digital platforms are critical for our increasingly interconnected customers, who often research products and check av ailable inv entory online before going into one of our stores to v iew products in person or talk to an associate and then making their purchase either in store or online. While in the store, customers may also go online to access ratings and rev iews, compare prices, v iew our extended assortment, and purchase additional products. Our inv estments in a truly interconnected experience are focused on bringing together the power of our physical presence and the frictionless interaction of our digital capabilities.\n\nA significant majority of the traffic in Home Depot's digital channels is on mobile dev ices. Mobile users expect more simplicity and relev ancy in their digital interactions. In addition to supporting our DIY and DIFM customers on their shopping journeys, mobile dev ices can also help serv e the needs of Pros working on complex projects. As a result, we hav e made inv estments in our digital platforms to improv e the ov erall presentation and ease of navigation for the user. We hav e also enhanced the 'shopability' of an online product by including more information on the product's landing page, including related products and/or parts of a collection, as well as v arious fulfillment options. We believ e our focus on improv ing search capabilities, site functionality, category presentation, product content such as customer product rev iew summaries, speed to checkout, and fulfillment options has yielded higher traffic, better conv ersion and continued sales growth. As our customers expect a more personalized experience, our ability to collect, use, retain, and protect relev ant customer data is important for our ability to effectiv ely meet their expectations.",

      "question": "How has the structure and value of HD's 4.95% Senior Notes evolved between 2023 and 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's long-term debt strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2023, HD issued $750 million of 4.95% senior notes due September 30, 2026, at a discount of $1.6 million. By 2024, the carrying amount of these 4.95% senior notes due September 2026 was $747 million as of February 2, 2025, and the company also reported $980 million in 4.95% senior notes due September 2052. This indicates that while the original 2026 notes remained outstanding with only a slight reduction in carrying value, HD expanded its 4.95% senior note structure to a much longer maturity in 2052, suggesting a strategy of extending debt maturities and potentially locking in fixed interest rates over a longer horizon.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, HD introduced the 4.95% Senior Notes with a $750 million issuance due September 30, 2026, at a $1.6 million discount.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the 4.95% Senior Notes due September 2026 had a carrying amount of $747 million, and a new tranche of $980 million in 4.95% Senior Notes was reported with a much later maturity date of September 2052.",
        "Step 3: The evolution shows that HD not only maintained the existing 2026 notes with minimal change in carrying value but also issued a new long-term 4.95% note tranche maturing in 2052, indicating a shift toward longer-term debt financing."

      "answer": "In 2023, the 4.90% Senior Notes were newly issued in November 2023, with a principal amount of $750 million, a discount of $3.4 million, and a maturity date of April 15, 2029. Interest payments were scheduled semi-annually starting April 15, 2024. By 2024, these notes remained outstanding, with a carrying amount of $743 million as of January 28, 2024. The maturity date remained unchanged at April 2029, and the notes continued to be listed among the company\u2019s long-term debt obligations. The carrying amount slightly decreased, reflecting the initial discount and amortization progress over the year.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 - In 2023, the 4.90% Senior Notes were newly issued with a principal of $750 million, a discount of $3.4 million, and a maturity date of April 15, 2029.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 - In 2024, the 4.90% Senior Notes had a carrying amount of $743 million as of January 28, 2024, indicating a slight decrease from the initial carrying amount, with the maturity date unchanged at April 2029.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The 4.90% Senior Notes remained structurally unchanged in terms of maturity and interest payment schedule, but their carrying amount slightly decreased due to the amortization of the initial discount."

      "answer": "In 2023, Self-Service Lockers were described as part of Home Depot's investments to improve the customer shopping experience, specifically to enable convenient online order pickup options alongside other features like wayfinding signage and electronic shelf labels. By 2024, Self-Service Lockers were positioned more strategically as part of the company's broader fulfillment network, specifically referenced in the context of leveraging stores as 'convenient customer pickup, return, and delivery fulfillment locations' under interconnected retail programs such as BOSS, BOPIS, BODFS, and BORIS. Additionally, in 2024, approximately 50% of U.S. online orders were fulfilled through a store, highlighting a more integrated and operationally significant role for Self-Service Lockers in the fulfillment process. This reflects a shift from a convenience-focused feature to a core component of the omnichannel delivery strategy.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2023, Self-Service Lockers were mentioned as part of store experience enhancements aimed at improving customer convenience and online pickup options.",
        "In 2024, Self-Service Lockers were positioned as part of the interconnected retail fulfillment programs and tied directly to the company's broader supply chain and delivery strategy.",
        "The evolution indicates a shift from being a customer-facing convenience feature to a strategically embedded part of the omnichannel fulfillment infrastructure, supported by the fact that 50% of U.S. online orders in 2024 were store-fulfilled."

Ov er the past sev eral years, we hav e inv ested to further automate and mechanize our rapid deployment center network to driv e greater efficiency and faster mov ement of product.\n\nWe are also continuing to enhance our supply chain network with our expanded fulfillment facilities designed to driv e speed and reliability of deliv ery for our customers. In many markets, we offer same day or next day deliv ery of a multitude of products through our stores and fulfillment centers. We also have omni-channel fulfillment centers that deliv er product directly to customers, and market deliv ery operations that function as local hubs to consolidate freight for dispatch to customers for the final mile of deliv ery, with a focus on appliances. We hav e inv ested in our capabilities to control more of our appliance deliv ery end-to-end, manage all of our appliance deliv ery v olume through our market deliv ery operations, and expand our last mile deliv ery capacity. We have also opened additional flatbed distribution centers that handle large items like lumber and building materials that are transported on flatbed trucks. Our network is designed to create a competitiv e adv antage with unique, industry-leading capabilities for home improv ement needs for both our Pros and consumers. We will continue to inv est in our supply chain network as needed to support our business.\n\nIn addition to our distribution and fulfillment centers, we lev erage our stores as a network of conv enient customer pickup, return, and deliv ery fulfillment locations. We believ e our premium real estate footprint prov ides a distinct structural and competitiv e adv antage. For customers who shop online and want to pick up or return merchandise at a store, or hav e product deliv ered from a store, we hav e four interconnected retail programs: BOSS, BOPIS, BODFS, and BORIS. We also provide curbside pickup to complement our BOPIS offerings, in addition to the self-serv ice lockers at the front entrance of many of our stores. We also offer car and v an deliv ery serv ice from the majority of our U.S. stores. For fiscal 2024, approximately 50% of our U.S. online orders were fulfilled through a store. SRS branch locations throughout the U.S. also enable deliv eries direct to customer job sites on their preferred timelines. We continue to focus on dev eloping new capabilities to improv e both efficiency and customer experience for deliv ery from our stores and branches. Our strategic intent is to hav e a portfolio of efficient, timely and reliable sources and methods of deliv ery to choose from, optimizing order fulfillment and deliv ery based on customer needs, inv entory locations, and av ailable transportation options.\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY AND HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\nWe view sustainability and human capital management matters through the lens of our business, with an understanding that if we support our associates, our customers, our suppliers, and the communities we serv e, we also support our business and create v alue for our shareholders. Our sustainability and human capital management priorities build on the culture and v alues on which Home Depot was founded, and our initiativ es are embedded in our business strategy and activ ities. We organize our efforts around three pillars: (1) Focus on Our People, (2) Operate Sustainably, and (3) Strengthen Our Communities. Highlights of each of these pillars are set forth below. For further information on our three pillars, including related goals, see our 2024 Env ironmental, Social and Gov ernance Report (the '2024 ESG Report'), av ailable on our inv estor relations website at https://ir.homedepot.com/sustainability.",

      "answer": "In 2022, HD emphasized internal initiatives to improve the associate experience through engagement surveys, a digital engagement platform, and recognition programs, which historically showed that four out of five associates were emotionally committed. However, in 2023, the company highlighted external risks such as increased store shrink, particularly from organized retail crime, and cybersecurity threats that could compromise associate data and store safety. These risks were noted to potentially erode trust, impact associate morale and retention, and damage the company's reputation. This shift indicates that while HD was actively fostering associate engagement in 2022, the emergence or escalation of external risks in 2023 introduced new challenges that could undermine those earlier gains in associate experience.",

        "The contrast between the positive engagement initiatives of 2022 and the external risks in 2023 suggests a shift in focus and potential challenges in maintaining the same level of associate experience."

          "chunk_text": "## Item 1. Business.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. is the world's largest home improvement retailer based on net sales for fiscal 2021. We offer our customers a wide assortment of building materials, home improvement products, lawn and garden products, d\u00e9cor products, and facilities maintenance, repair and operations products and provide a number of services, including home improvement installation services and tool and equipment rental. As of the end of fiscal 2021, we operated 2,317 stores located throughout the U.S. (including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam), Canada, and Mexico. The Home Depot stores average approximately 104,000 square feet of enclosed space, with approximately 24,000 additional square feet of outside garden area. We also maintain a network of distribution and fulfillment centers, as well as a number of e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. When we refer to 'The Home Depot,' the 'Company,' 'we,' 'us' or 'our' in this report, we are referring to The Home Depot, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated in 1978. Our Store Support Center (corporate office) is located at 2455 Paces Ferry Road, Atlanta, Georgia 30339. Our telephone number at that address is (770) 433-8211.\n\n## Our Business\n\n## Our Strategy\n\nThe retail landscape has changed rapidly over the past several years, with customer expectations constantly evolving. In fiscal 2021, this trend continued due to the challenges created by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the broader domestic and global business environment, including supply chain disruptions, tight labor market conditions, and inflationary pressures. To navigate this dynamic environment and meet heightened levels of home improvement demand throughout the year, we had to operate with agility while also managing evolving requirements to support customer and associate safety.\n\nOur ability to operate successfully and meet the needs of our customers was due in significant part to our strategic investments over the past several years aimed at creating an interconnected, frictionless shopping experience that enables our customers to seamlessly blend the digital and physical worlds. Going forward, we will leverage the momentum of these strategic investments and continue to invest in our business in support of the following goals:\n\n- We intend to provide the best customer experience in home improvement;\n- We intend to extend our position as the low-cost provider in home improvement; and\n- We intend to be the most efficient investor of capital in home improvement.\n\nWe believe that these goals will help us grow faster than the market and deliver value to our shareholders. We are steadfast in this commitment, while also recognizing that exercising corporate responsibility and being informed by the needs of our other stakeholders, including our customers, associates, supplier partners, and communities, creates value for all stakeholders, including our shareholders.\n\n## Deliver Shareholder Value\n\nWe deliver on our objective to create shareholder value through our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Our capital allocation principles are as follows:\n\n- First, we intend to reinvest in our business to drive growth faster than the market.\n- Second, after meeting the needs of the business, we look to return excess cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We intend to increase our dividend as we grow earnings.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we invested $2.6 billion in capital expenditures to support an interconnected customer experience. We also focused on driving productivity throughout the business to lower our costs. The combination of reinvesting in the business to drive higher sales and driving productivity to lower costs creates what we refer to as a virtuous cycle, which has allowed us to improve the customer experience, increase our competitiveness in the market, and deliver shareholder value.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we returned approximately $22 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We paid $7.0 billion in cash dividends and returned approximately $15.0 billion to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases in fiscal 2021. Our capital allocation is discussed further in Item 7, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.'\n\n## PART I",

The plan for U.S. associates is a tax-qualified plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. The non-U.S. plan is not a Section 423 plan. At January 30, 2022, there were approximately 17 million shares available under the U.S. plan and approximately 19 million shares available under the non-U.S. plan. The purchase price of shares under the ESPPs is equal to 85% of the stock's fair market value on the last day of the purchase period, which is a six-month period ending on December 31 and June 30 of each year. During fiscal 2021, there were approximately one million shares purchased under the ESPPs at an average price of $305.14. Under the outstanding ESPPs at January 30, 2022, associates have contributed $22 million to purchase shares at 85% of the stock's fair market value on the last day of the current purchase period, June 30, 2022.\n\n## 9. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\n\nWe maintain active defined contribution retirement plans for our associates (the 'Benefit Plans'). All associates satisfying certain service requirements are eligible to participate in the Benefit Plans. We make cash contributions each payroll period up to specified percentages of associates' contributions as approved by our Board of Directors.\n\nWe also maintain the Restoration Plan to provide certain associates deferred compensation that they would have received under the Benefit Plans as a matching contribution if not for the maximum compensation limits under the Internal Revenue Code. We fund the Restoration Plan through contributions made to a grantor trust, which are then used to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market.\n\nThe following table presents our contributions to the Benefit Plans and the Restoration Plan:\n\n",

      "answer": "In the 2022 10-K filing, Amazon described competitive stores as a general factor among many that could impact sales and operating results, listing them alongside internal capabilities such as inventory management and customer satisfaction. The 2022 filing included the phrase: 'the introduction of competitive stores, websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements' as a potential cause of sales fluctuations. In contrast, the 2023 filing retained the same core language but embedded it within a broader context that emphasized external economic and geopolitical conditions, stating that revenue and operating profit growth 'depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our business is affected by, among other things, general economic, business, and geopolitical conditions worldwide.'

A softening of demand, whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global economies, may result in decreased revenue or growth.\n\nOur sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to factors described elsewhere in this section and the following:\n\n- our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers' demands;\n- our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers;\n- our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders;\n- the introduction of competitive stores, websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements;\n- changes in usage or adoption rates of the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and web services, including outside the U.S.;\n- timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure;\n- the success of our geographic, service, and product line expansions;\n- the extent to which we finance, and the terms of any such financing for, our current operations and future growth;\n- the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, which may include significant monetary damages or injunctive relief and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results;\n- variations in the mix of products and services we sell;\n- variations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns;\n- the extent to which we offer fast and free delivery, continue to reduce prices worldwide, and provide additional benefits to our customers;\n- factors affecting our reputation or brand image (including any actual or perceived inability to achieve our goals or commitments, whether related to sustainability, customers, employees, or other topics);\n- the extent to which we invest in technology and content, fulfillment, and other expense categories;\n- increases in the prices of fuel and gasoline, energy products, commodities like paper and packing supplies and hardware products, and technology infrastructure products;\n- constrained labor markets, which increase our payroll costs;\n- the extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our stores successfully charge fees to grant our customers unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online services;\n- our ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due;\n- the extent to which new and existing technologies, or industry trends, restrict online advertising or affect our ability to customize advertising or otherwise tailor our product and service offerings;",

      "answer": "Amazon's monetization strategy for film groups evolved between 2022 and 2023, as evidenced by an increase in both the capitalized video and music content costs and the associated expenses. In 2022, the capitalized costs were $16.7 billion with total video and music expenses of $16.6 billion, while in 2023, these figures increased to $17.4 billion and $18.9 billion, respectively. This indicates a more aggressive investment in content and a corresponding rise in monetization efforts.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWhen we have the option to extend the lease term, terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date, or purchase the leased asset, and it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option, we consider the option in determining the classification and measurement of the lease. Our leases may include variable payments based on measures that include changes in price indices, market interest rates, or the level of sales at a physical store, which are expensed as incurred.\n\nCosts associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the term of the lease. Finance lease assets are amortized within operating expenses on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or, in the instance where title does not transfer at the end of the lease term, the lease term. The interest component of a finance lease is included in interest expense and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term.\n\nWe establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are amortized over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs.\n\n## Financing Obligations\n\nWe record assets and liabilities for estimated construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period. If we continue to control the building after the construction period, the arrangement is classified as a financing obligation instead of a lease. The building is depreciated over the shorter of its useful life or the term of the obligation.\n\nIf we do not control the building after the construction period ends, the assets and liabilities for construction costs are derecognized, and we classify the lease as operating.\n\n## Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\n\nWe evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value and if so, we perform a quantitative test. We compare the carrying value of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset to its estimated fair value and if the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value, we recognize an impairment loss for the difference. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions.\n\nWe completed the required annual impairment test of goodwill for all reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of April 1, 2021, resulting in no impairments. The fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value. There were no events that caused us to update our annual impairment test. See 'Note 5 - Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets.'\n\n## Other Assets\n\nIncluded in 'Other assets' on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to video and music content, net of accumulated amortization; acquired intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization; equity warrant assets; long-term deferred tax assets; and certain equity investments.\n\n## Digital Video and Music Content\n\nWe obtain video content, inclusive of episodic television and movies, and music content for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment schedules. When the license fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us, we recognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We reduce the liability as payments are made and we amortize the asset to 'Cost of sales' on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage or viewing patterns, or on a straight-line basis. If the licensing fee is not determinable or reasonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred. We also develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to 'Cost of sales' predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the viewing patterns associated with the content. The weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 2.6 years.\n\nOur produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group, in each major geography where we offer Amazon Prime memberships. These film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the fair value is less than the carrying value. The total capitalized costs of video, which is primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 were $6.8 billion and $10.7 billion.",

      "question": "How did Amazon's co-branded credit card programs shift in strategic significance and associated regulatory risks from 2022 to 2023, particularly in terms of new compliance obligations and their potential impact on operating results?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Amazon introduced co-branded credit card programs as part of its payment offerings, highlighting the risk that renewal on less favorable terms or termination could adversely affect operating results. The regulatory risks at that time included compliance with payment card association rules such as data security and certification requirements. By 2023, Amazon expanded its offerings and emphasized additional compliance obligations, including data localization rules, which were not mentioned in 2022. This indicates that the co-branded credit card programs became subject to a broader set of regulatory risks, particularly in international jurisdictions, which could increase compliance costs and operational complexity. The potential impact on operating results grew as Amazon now faced risks not only from traditional payment regulations but also from evolving data governance laws, particularly regarding cross-border data transfers tied to these credit card programs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, co-branded credit card programs were introduced with risks related to contract renewal and compliance with payment card association rules such as data security and certification requirements.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, co-branded credit card programs were described as part of an expanded payment offering, now including risks from data localization laws, which were not present in the prior year's disclosures.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects an increase in both the strategic importance and regulatory complexity of the co-branded credit card programs, with a moderate magnitude of change."

For existing and future payment options we offer to our customers, we currently are subject to, and may become subject to additional, regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products), as well as fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We rely on third parties to provide certain Amazon-branded payment methods and payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, and promotional financing. In each case, it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We also offer co-branded credit card programs, which could adversely affect our operating results if renewed on less favorable terms or terminated. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. Failure to comply with these rules or requirements, as well as any breach, compromise, or failure to otherwise detect or prevent fraudulent activity involving our data security systems, could result in our being liable for card issuing banks' costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\n\nIn addition, we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties, and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf. Jurisdictions subject us to requirements for licensing, regulatory inspection, bonding and capital maintenance, the use, handling, and segregation of transferred funds, consumer disclosures, maintaining or processing data, and authentication. We are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments, money laundering, international money transfers, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, network security, consumer protection, and electronic fund transfers. If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties, or forced to cease providing certain services.\n\n## We Have a Rapidly Evolving Business Model and Our Stock Price Is Highly Volatile\n\nWe have a rapidly evolving business model. The trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to, among other risks, the risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A, as well as:\n\n- changes in interest rates;\n- conditions or trends in the Internet and the industry segments we operate in;\n- quarterly variations in operating results;\n- fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for Internet-related companies in particular;\n- changes in financial estimates by us or decisions to increase or decrease future spending or investment levels;\n- changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;\n- changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public;\n- changes in the valuation methodology of, or performance by, other e-commerce or technology companies; and\n- transactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports, news, and speculation.\n\nVolatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically, which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders, or both.\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Risks\n\n## Government Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business\n\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, digital content, web services, electronic devices, advertising, artificial intelligence technologies and services, and other products and services that we offer or sell. These regulations and laws cover taxation, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, network security, consumer protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, transportation, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, energy consumption, environmental regulation, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, employment, trade and protectionist measures, web services, the provision of online payment services, registration, licensing, and information reporting",

      "answer": "In 2022, Amazon described competitive websites as part of a broader list of fluctuating business factors, indicating a general awareness of competitive pressures. By 2023, Amazon's language evolved to reflect a more direct and strategic competitive stance, specifically highlighting the introduction of 'competitive stores, websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements' as a central concern. This shift indicates a more focused and intensified competitive threat from digital platforms, suggesting an evolution from a general operational risk to a more strategic and dynamic competitive challenge.",

When the U.S. Dollar strengthens compared to these currencies, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, when translated, may be materially less than expected and vice versa.\n\n## Operating Risks\n\n## Our Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources\n\nWe are continuing to rapidly and significantly expand our global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses. The complexity of the current scale of our business can place significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions, and our expansion increases these factors. Failure to manage growth effectively could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\n\n## We Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate\n\nWe are not always able to accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed, and we are not always able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected.\n\nOur revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide. A softening of demand, whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global economies, may result in decreased revenue or growth.\n\nOur sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to factors described elsewhere in this section and the following:\n\n- our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers' demands;\n- our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers;\n- our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders;\n- the introduction of competitive stores, websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements;\n- changes in usage or adoption rates of the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and web services, including outside the U.S.;\n- timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure;\n- the success of our geographic, service, and product line expansions;\n- the extent to which we finance, and the terms of any such financing for, our current operations and future growth;\n- the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, which may include significant monetary damages or injunctive relief and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results;\n- variations in the mix of products and services we sell;\n- variations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns;\n- the extent to which we offer fast and free delivery, continue to reduce prices worldwide, and provide additional benefits to our customers;\n- factors affecting our reputation or brand image (including any actual or perceived inability to achieve our goals or commitments, whether related to sustainability, customers, employees, or other topics);\n- the extent to which we invest in technology and content, fulfillment, and other expense categories;\n- increases in the prices of fuel and gasoline, energy products, commodities like paper and packing supplies and hardware products, and technology infrastructure products;\n- constrained labor markets, which increase our payroll costs;\n- the extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our stores successfully charge fees to grant our customers unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online services;\n- our ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due;\n- the extent to which new and existing technologies, or industry trends, restrict online advertising or affect our ability to customize advertising or otherwise tailor our product and service offerings;",

      "answer": "In 2022, AWS was positioned primarily as a key area of investment within Amazon's broader technology and content spending, with an emphasis on supporting geographic expansion, new product categories, and internal operational efficiencies. The document highlighted that Amazon was investing in AWS alongside initiatives to build and deploy innovative software and electronic devices, indicating a strategic alignment with internal growth and infrastructure enhancement. By 2023, AWS had evolved into one of Amazon's three core business segments\u2014alongside North America and International\u2014reflecting its elevated strategic importance. The 2023 filing explicitly states that AWS serves developers and enterprises by offering a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and is now a distinct and central pillar of Amazon\u2019s business model. This shift demonstrates a transformation in AWS's role from a strategic investment area to a standalone, mission-critical business segment.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nby us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers.\n\nWe expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content, including AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, data storage and analytics, improved wireless connectivity, and the practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, will continue to improve users' experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people's lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services, to developers and enterprises of all sizes. We are also investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices.\n\nWe seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders' interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 518 million and 523 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.\n\nOur financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes.\n\nIn addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons.\n\nFor additional information about each line item addressed above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.'\n\nOur Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 in Item 7 of Part II, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.'\n\n## Critical Accounting Judgments\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States ('GAAP') requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.' Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.",

          "chunk_text": "## Energy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment\n\nThe long-term success of this business is dependent upon increasing margins through greater volumes. We continue to increase the production of our energy storage products to meet high levels of demand, including beginning construction of our Megafactory in Lathrop, California, but such production is also sensitive to global component constraints. For Megapack, energy storage deployments can vary meaningfully quarter to quarter depending on the timing of specific project milestones. For Powerwall, better availability and growing grid stability concerns drive higher customer interest, and we are emphasizing crossselling with our residential solar energy products. We remain committed to growing our retrofit solar energy business by offering a low-cost and simplified online ordering experience. In addition, we continue to improve our installation capabilities and price efficiencies for Solar Roof by on-boarding and training new installers, as well as collaborating with real estate developers and builders on new homes to reduce installation time and costs. As these product lines grow, we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products and hire additional personnel, particularly skilled electricians, to support the ramp of Solar Roof.\n\n## Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends\n\nOur capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time, and may further be impacted by uncertainties in future global market conditions. We are simultaneously ramping new products in the new Model S and Model X, Megapack and Solar Roof, ramping manufacturing facilities on three continents and piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies, and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall priority among projects, the pace at which we meet milestones, production adjustments to and among our various products, increased capital efficiencies and the addition of new projects. Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development and all other continuing infrastructure growth, we currently expect our capital expenditures to be between $5.00 to $7.00 billion in 2022 and each of the next two fiscal years.\n\nOur business has recently been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend, and with better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales growth is also facilitating positive cash generation. On the other hand, we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods depending on the specific pace of our capital-intensive projects and rising material prices and increasing supply chain and labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and labor availability associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, as our stock price has significantly increased, we have seen higher levels of early conversions of 'in-themoney' convertible senior notes, which obligates us to deliver cash and or shares pursuant to the terms of those notes. Overall, we expect our ability to be self-funding to continue as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales.\n\n## Operating Expense Trends\n\nAs long as we see expanding sales, and excluding the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions including increased labor costs and impairment charges on certain assets as explained below, we generally expect operating expenses relative to revenues to decrease as we continue to increase operational efficiency and process automation. We expect operating expenses to grow in 2022 as we are expanding our operations globally.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2021, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin. We believe in the long-term potential of digital assets both as an investment and also as a liquid alternative to cash. As with any investment and consistent with how we manage fiat-based cash and cash-equivalent accounts, we may increase or decrease our holdings of digital assets at any time based on the needs of the business and our view of market and environmental conditions. Digital assets are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules. Accordingly, any decrease in their fair values below our carrying values for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition will require us to recognize impairment charges, whereas we may make no upward revisions for any market price increases until a sale. For any digital assets held now or in the future, these charges may negatively impact our profitability in the periods in which such impairments occur even if the overall market values of these assets increase. For example, in the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded approximately $101 million of impairment losses resulting from changes to the carrying value of our bitcoin and gains of $128 million on certain sales of bitcoin by us.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ('GAAP'). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected.",

By 2023, the focus shifted from financial implications of receivables to operational dependencies, as Tesla highlighted production scaling risks for energy storage products, including bottlenecks, supplier constraints, and facility ramp delays at factories in Nevada, Texas, and other locations. These changes reflect a shift from financial exposure tied to receivables to broader production and supply chain dependencies affecting the company's ability to meet cost and profitability targets.",

Available-for-sale marketable securities with maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase are included in short-term marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheet. Interest, dividends, amortization and accretion of purchase premiums and discounts on our marketable securities are included in other income (expense), net.\n\nThe cost of available-for-sale marketable securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Realized gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale marketable securities are recorded in other income (expense), net.\n\nWe regularly review all of our marketable securities for declines in fair value. The review includes but is not limited to (i) the consideration of the cause of the decline, (ii) any currently recorded expected credit losses and (iii) the creditworthiness of the respective security issuers. The amortized cost basis of our marketable securities approximates its fair value.\n\n## Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\n\nAccounts receivable primarily include amounts related to receivables from financial institutions and leasing companies offering various financing products to our customers, sales of energy generation and storage products, sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers, government rebates already passed through to customers and maintenance services on vehicles owned by leasing companies. We provide an allowance against accounts receivable for the amount we expect to be uncollectible. We write-off accounts receivable against the allowance when they are deemed uncollectible.\n\nDepending on the day of the week on which the end of a fiscal quarter falls, our accounts receivable balance may fluctuate as we are waiting for certain customer payments to clear through our banking institutions and receipts of payments from our financing partners, which can take up to approximately two weeks based on the contractual payment terms with such partners. Our accounts receivable balances associated with our sales of regulatory credits, which are typically transferred to other manufacturers during the last few days of the quarter, is dependent on contractual payment terms. Additionally, government rebates can take up to a year or more to be collected depending on the customary processing timelines of the specific jurisdictions issuing them. These various factors may have a significant impact on our accounts receivable balance from period to period. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had $627 million and $46 million, respectively, of long-term government rebates receivable in Other non-current assets on our consolidated balance sheets.",

          "chunk_text": "## Energy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment\n\nThe long-term success of this business is dependent upon increasing margins through greater volumes. We continue to increase the production of our energy storage products to meet high levels of demand, including beginning construction of our Megafactory in Lathrop, California, but such production is also sensitive to global component constraints. For Megapack, energy storage deployments can vary meaningfully quarter to quarter depending on the timing of specific project milestones. For Powerwall, better availability and growing grid stability concerns drive higher customer interest, and we are emphasizing crossselling with our residential solar energy products. We remain committed to growing our retrofit solar energy business by offering a low-cost and simplified online ordering experience. In addition, we continue to improve our installation capabilities and price efficiencies for Solar Roof by on-boarding and training new installers, as well as collaborating with real estate developers and builders on new homes to reduce installation time and costs. As these product lines grow, we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products and hire additional personnel, particularly skilled electricians, to support the ramp of Solar Roof.\n\n## Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends\n\nOur capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time, and may further be impacted by uncertainties in future global market conditions. We are simultaneously ramping new products in the new Model S and Model X, Megapack and Solar Roof, ramping manufacturing facilities on three continents and piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies, and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall priority among projects, the pace at which we meet milestones, production adjustments to and among our various products, increased capital efficiencies and the addition of new projects. Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development and all other continuing infrastructure growth, we currently expect our capital expenditures to be between $5.00 to $7.00 billion in 2022 and each of the next two fiscal years.\n\nOur business has recently been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend, and with better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales growth is also facilitating positive cash generation. On the other hand, we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods depending on the specific pace of our capital-intensive projects and rising material prices and increasing supply chain and labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and labor availability associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, as our stock price has significantly increased, we have seen higher levels of early conversions of 'in-themoney' convertible senior notes, which obligates us to deliver cash and or shares pursuant to the terms of those notes. Overall, we expect our ability to be self-funding to continue as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales.\n\n## Operating Expense Trends\n\nAs long as we see expanding sales, and excluding the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions including increased labor costs and impairment charges on certain assets as explained below, we generally expect operating expenses relative to revenues to decrease as we continue to increase operational efficiency and process automation. We expect operating expenses to grow in 2022 as we are expanding our operations globally.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2021, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin. We believe in the long-term potential of digital assets both as an investment and also as a liquid alternative to cash. As with any investment and consistent with how we manage fiat-based cash and cash-equivalent accounts, we may increase or decrease our holdings of digital assets at any time based on the needs of the business and our view of market and environmental conditions. Digital assets are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules. Accordingly, any decrease in their fair values below our carrying values for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition will require us to recognize impairment charges, whereas we may make no upward revisions for any market price increases until a sale. For any digital assets held now or in the future, these charges may negatively impact our profitability in the periods in which such impairments occur even if the overall market values of these assets increase. For example, in the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded approximately $101 million of impairment losses resulting from changes to the carrying value of our bitcoin and gains of $128 million on certain sales of bitcoin by us.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ('GAAP'). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Tesla disclosed that accounts receivable from financing partners could take up to approximately two weeks to settle based on contractual payment terms, directly impacting the company's short-term liquidity and balance sheet fluctuations. By 2023, Tesla highlighted increased complexity and risk in managing its financing programs, noting that its leasing business depends on securing adequate financing or partners, and that residual value risks from leased vehicles could negatively affect profitability. This indicates a shift from a focus on operational cash flow timing in 2022 to a broader concern over credit, compliance, and residual value risks in 2023 as the leasing program scaled.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, Tesla's accounts receivable from financing partners were described with a specific contractual payment term of up to two weeks, indicating a structured and predictable cash flow mechanism.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, Tesla emphasized growing risks in its financing programs, including the need for adequate financing partners, compliance with financial regulations, and the challenge of managing residual value risks from leased vehicles.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects an evolution from a focus on receivables timing to a more complex set of risks tied to scaling the leasing business and maintaining external financing partnerships."

          "chunk_text": "\n## Marketable Securities\n\nMarketable securities may be comprised of a combination of U.S. government securities and corporate debt securities and are all designated as available-for-sale and reported at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income which is included within stockholders' equity. Available-for-sale marketable securities with maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase are included in short-term marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheet. Interest, dividends, amortization and accretion of purchase premiums and discounts on our marketable securities are included in other income (expense), net.\n\nThe cost of available-for-sale marketable securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Realized gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale marketable securities are recorded in other income (expense), net.\n\nWe regularly review all of our marketable securities for declines in fair value. The review includes but is not limited to (i) the consideration of the cause of the decline, (ii) any currently recorded expected credit losses and (iii) the creditworthiness of the respective security issuers. The amortized cost basis of our marketable securities approximates its fair value.\n\n## Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\n\nAccounts receivable primarily include amounts related to receivables from financial institutions and leasing companies offering various financing products to our customers, sales of energy generation and storage products, sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers, government rebates already passed through to customers and maintenance services on vehicles owned by leasing companies. We provide an allowance against accounts receivable for the amount we expect to be uncollectible. We write-off accounts receivable against the allowance when they are deemed uncollectible.\n\nDepending on the day of the week on which the end of a fiscal quarter falls, our accounts receivable balance may fluctuate as we are waiting for certain customer payments to clear through our banking institutions and receipts of payments from our financing partners, which can take up to approximately two weeks based on the contractual payment terms with such partners. Our accounts receivable balances associated with our sales of regulatory credits, which are typically transferred to other manufacturers during the last few days of the quarter, is dependent on contractual payment terms. Additionally, government rebates can take up to a year or more to be collected depending on the customary processing timelines of the specific jurisdictions issuing them. These various factors may have a significant impact on our accounts receivable balance from period to period. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had $627 million and $46 million, respectively, of long-term government rebates receivable in Other non-current assets on our consolidated balance sheets.",

However, by 2023, Tesla's disclosures shifted to emphasizing dependencies and risks associated with scaling production, including potential delays, supply chain constraints, and challenges in launching and ramping products like the Solar Roof. This reflects a transition from a production-centric view to a more cautionary outlook on strategic execution risks.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Tesla clearly stated it used Gigafactory New York for the development and production of the Solar Roof, indicating direct involvement and operational control.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, Tesla highlighted that its business depends on successfully ramping production of products like the Solar Roof, but also warned of potential delays and dependencies on suppliers and manufacturing scalability.",
        "Step 3: The shift from a statement of production capability in 2022 to a focus on dependencies and risks in 2023 indicates an evolution from operational execution to strategic vulnerability around the Solar Roof."

          "chunk_text": "## Insurance\n\nIn August 2019, we launched an insurance product designed for our customers in California. In 2021, we launched our insurance product using real-time driving behavior in select states, which offers rates that are often better than other alternatives and promotes safer driving. Our insurance products are currently available in Arizona, California, Illinois, Ohio and Texas and we plan to expand the markets in which we offer insurance products, as part of our ongoing effort to decrease the total cost of ownership for our customers.\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage\n\nWe currently offer certain loan and PPA options to residential or commercial customers who pair energy storage systems with solar energy systems. We offer certain financing options to our solar customers, which enable the customer to purchase and own a solar energy system, Solar Roof or integrated solar and Powerwall system. Our solar PPAs, offered to commercial customers, charges a fee per kilowatt-hour based on the amount of electricity produced by our solar energy systems.\n\n## Manufacturing\n\n## Manufacturing Facilities in the Bay Area, California\n\nWe manufacture and test our vehicles at our manufacturing facilities in the Bay Area in California, including the Fremont Factory and other local manufacturing facilities. We also manufacture and develop certain parts and components that are critical to our intellectual property and quality standards, such as Model S and Model X battery packs and our proprietary lithium-ion battery cells, at these locations.\n\n## Gigafactory Nevada near Reno, Nevada\n\nOur battery material, cell, module and battery pack production for Model 3, Model Y and our energy products are manufactured in one location at Gigafactory Nevada. In addition, we manufacture vehicle drive units and energy storage components there. Gigafactory Nevada allows us to access high volumes of lithium-ion battery cells manufactured by our partner Panasonic there while achieving a significant reduction in the cost of our battery packs. We continue to invest in Gigafactory Nevada to achieve additional output there.\n\n## Gigafactory New York in Buffalo, New York\n\nWe use Gigafactory New York for the development and production of our Solar Roof and other solar products and components, energy storage components and Supercharger components and for other functions.\n\n## Gigafactory Shanghai in China\n\nWe established Gigafactory Shanghai to increase the affordability of our vehicles for customers in local markets by reducing transportation and manufacturing costs and eliminating the impact of unfavorable tariffs. We continue to increase the degree of localized procurement and manufacturing there. Gigafactory Shanghai is representative of our plan to iteratively improve our manufacturing operations as we establish new factories, as we implemented the learnings from our Model 3 and Model Y ramp at the Fremont Factory to commence and ramp our production at Gigafactory Shanghai quickly and cost-effectively.\n\n## Other Manufacturing\n\nGenerally, we continue to expand production capacity at our existing facilities. We also intend to further increase costcompetitiveness in our significant markets by strategically adding local manufacturing, including at Gigafactory Berlin in Germany and Gigafactory Texas in Austin, Texas, which will begin production in 2022.\n\n## Supply Chain\n\nOur products use thousands of purchased parts that are sourced from hundreds of suppliers across the world. We have developed close relationships with vendors of key parts such as battery cells, electronics and complex vehicle assemblies. Certain components purchased from these suppliers are shared or are similar across many product lines, allowing us to take advantage of pricing efficiencies from economies of scale.\n\nAs is the case for most automotive companies, most of our procured components and systems are sourced from single suppliers. Where multiple sources are available for certain key components, we work to qualify multiple suppliers for them where it is sensible to do so in order to minimize production risks owing to disruptions in their supply. We also mitigate risk by maintaining safety stock for key parts and assemblies and die banks for components with lengthy procurement lead times.",

Our investments in our stores may not deliver the relevant shopping experience our customers expect or fully support an interconnected shopping experience. We must also maintain a safe store environment for our customers and associates, as well as protect against loss or theft of our inventory (also called 'shrink'). Higher rates of shrink, which we continue to experience, can require operational changes that may increase costs and impact the customer experience.\n\nOur investments to enhance our interconnected shopping experience and expand our supply chain might not provide the anticipated benefits, might take longer than expected to complete or realize anticipated benefits, or might fail altogether, each of which could adversely impact our competitive position and our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\nIf we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of both brand name and proprietary products, we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors.\n\nAs part of our focus on product differentiation, we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of well-recognized brand names. We have also developed relationships with selected suppliers to allow us to market proprietary products that are comparable to national brands. Our proprietary products differentiate us from other retailers, generally carry higher margins than national brand products, and represent a growing portion of our business. If we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships, maintain favorable terms with current suppliers, or identify alternative sources for comparable brand name and proprietary products, we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation, which may impact our sales and gross margin results.\n\nOur strategic transactions involve risks, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions.\n\nWe regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions, investments, alliances, and other growth and market expansion strategies, such as our acquisition of HD Supply in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. We generally expect that these transactions will result in sales increases, cost savings, synergies, enhanced capabilities or various other benefits. Assessing the viability and realizing the benefits of these transactions is subject to significant uncertainty. For each of our acquisitions, we need to determine the appropriate level of integration of the target company's products, services, associates, and information technology, financial, human resources, compliance, and other systems and processes, and then successfully manage that integration into our corporate structure. Integration can be a complex and time-consuming process, and if the integration is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of time, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies or benefits of the acquisition. In addition, the integration of businesses may create complexity in our financial systems, internal controls, technology and cybersecurity systems, and operations and make them more difficult to manage. Furthermore, even if the target companies are successfully integrated, the acquisitions may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated, expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products or services, and expose us to additional risks and liabilities. Strategic transactions may also be subject to significant regulatory uncertainty. The changing enforcement landscape may result in additional costs or delays that affect the anticipated outcome of a transaction. Any failure in the execution of a strategic transaction, our approach to the integration of an acquired asset or business, or achieving expected synergies or other benefits could result in slower growth, higher than expected costs, the recording of an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, and other actions which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Operational Risks\n\nOur success depends upon our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified associates to provide excellent customer service and to support our strategic initiatives while also controlling our labor costs.\n\nOur customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates. To meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we must attract, develop and retain a large number of highly qualified associates. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including increased market pressures with respect to prevailing wage rates, unemployment levels, and health and other insurance costs; the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations, immigration, minimum wage, and healthcare benefits; changing demographics; the continuing impacts of the pandemic; and our reputation within the labor market. We also compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions, and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction. These positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs, particularly in a competitive labor market.

We also acquired SRS to accelerate our growth with Pros. We continue to focus on driv ing productiv ity throughout the business by lowering our product and transportation costs, and in fiscal 2024 we executed a plan to reduce our fixed cost structure by approximately $500 million. The combination of reinv esting in our business to driv e higher sales and driv ing productiv ity to lower costs allows us to improv e our customer experience, increase our competitiv eness in the market, and deliv er shareholder v alue.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, we returned $8.9 billion to shareholders in the form of cash div idends. We also returned $0.6 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases prior to pausing share repurchases in March 2024 in anticipation of the SRS acquisition. Our capital allocation is discussed further in Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\n## OUR CUSTOMERS\n\nWe serve two primary customer groups - consumers (including both DIY and DIFM customers) and Pros - and hav e dev eloped v arying approaches to meet their div erse needs:\n\n## DIY Customers\n\nThese customers are typically homeowners who purchase products and complete their own projects and installations. Our associates assist these customers both in our stores and through online resources and other media designed to prov ide product and project knowledge. We also offer a v ariety of clinics and workshops to share this knowledge and to build an emotional connection with our DIY customers. As the preferences and behav iors of our DIY customers are changing, we are inv esting in capabilities to better meet the ev olv ing expectations of these customers.\n\n## Professional Customers (or 'Pros')\n\nThese customers are primarily professional renov ators/remodelers, general contractors, small to medium homebuilders, maintenance professionals, handymen, property managers, building serv ice contractors and specialty tradespeople, such as electricians, landscapers, plumbers, painters, pool contractors, and roofers. These customers build, renov ate, remodel, repair, and maintain residential properties, multifamily properties, hospitality properties, and commercial facilities, including education, healthcare, gov ernment, institutional, and office buildings.\n\nWe have a number of initiativ es designed to driv e growth with Pros, including those working on both simple and complex projects. In fiscal 2024, we acquired SRS, which sells products to specialty trade roofers, landscapers, and pool contractors. We remain focused on prov iding a customized online experience, a dedicated sales force, a broad assortment of Pro-focused products and brands, an extensiv e deliv ery network, our Pro X tra loyalty program, and enhanced credit offerings. Building on our historical strength as a destination for urgent purchase needs, we are inv esting in differentiated capabilities that will help us better serv e our Pros' complex purchase needs, including differentiated fulfillment options, additional trade credit offerings including our Pro House Account program, more showroom space, and an enhanced order management system. We also prov ide MRO products and related v alue-added serv ices to multifamily, hospitality, healthcare, and gov ernment housing facilities, among others, primarily through our subsidiary HD Supply.\n\n## DIFM Customers\n\nIntersecting our DIY customers and our Pros are our DIFM customers. These customers are typically homeowners who use Pros to complete their projects or installations. Currently, we offer installation serv ices in a v ariety of categories, such as flooring, water heaters, bath, garage doors, cabinets, cabinet makeovers, countertops, sheds, furnaces and central air systems, and windows. DIFM customers can purchase these serv ices in our stores, online, or in their homes through in-home consultations. In addition to serv ing our DIFM customer needs, we believ e our focus on the Pros who perform serv ices for these customers helps us driv e higher product sales.",

      "question": "How has The Home Depot's approach to store appearance and its role in competition evolved from 2022 to 2024, particularly in relation to customer experience and digital integration?",
      "answer": "In 2022, The Home Depot emphasized store appearance as a competitive factor alongside customer experience, price, and product availability. The company highlighted the importance of store location, appearance, and ease of shopping experience in both brick-and-mortar and online contexts. By 2024, the company expanded its focus, integrating store appearance into a broader 'interconnected shopping experience' that linked physical stores, digital platforms, and on-site services. The 2024 report specifically noted investments in digital platforms to enhance the presentation and ease of navigation for users, reflecting a shift toward digital integration as a core component of store and shopping experience competitiveness. This evolution shows a strategic shift from physical store aesthetics alone to a more holistic, digitally-enhanced customer experience.",

We also provide tool and equipment rentals at over 1,400 locations across the U.S. and Canada, providing value and convenience for both Pros and consumers. To improve the customer experience and continue to grow this differentiated service offering, we are continuing to invest in more locations, more tools, and better technology.\n\nSourcing and Quality Assurance. We maintain a global sourcing program to obtain high-quality and innovative products directly from manufacturers in the U.S. and around the world. During fiscal 2021, in addition to our U.S. sourcing operations, we maintained sourcing offices in Mexico, Canada, China, India, Vietnam and Europe. To ensure that suppliers adhere to our high standards of social and environmental responsibility, we also have a global responsible sourcing program. Under our supplier contracts, our suppliers are obligated to ensure that their products comply with applicable international, federal, state and local laws. These contracts also require compliance with our responsible sourcing standards, which cover a variety of expectations across multiple areas of social compliance, including supply chain transparency, health and safety, environment, compensation, hours of work, and prohibitions on child and forced labor. To drive accountability with our suppliers, our standard supplier buying agreement includes a factory audit right related to these standards, and we conduct factory audits and compliance visits with our suppliers of private branded and direct import products. Our 2021 Responsible Sourcing Report, available on our website at https://corporate.homedepot.com/responsibility/sourcing-responsibility, provides more information about this program. In addition, we have both quality assurance and engineering resources dedicated to establishing criteria and overseeing compliance with safety, quality and performance standards for our private branded products.\n\nIntellectual Property. Our business has one of the most recognized brands in North America. As a result, we believe that The Home Depot  trademark has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our products, ecommerce, stores and business. We have registered or applied for registration of trademarks, service marks, copyrights and internet domain names, both domestically and internationally, for use in our business, including our proprietary brands such as HDX , Husky , Hampton Bay , Home Decorators Collection , Glacier Bay , Vigoro , Everbilt and Lifeproof . The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\nWe also maintain patent portfolios relating to our business operations, retail services and products and seek to patent or otherwise protect innovations we incorporate into our business. Patents generally have a term of twenty years from the date they are filed. As our patent portfolio has been built over time, the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary. Although our patents have value, no single patent is essential to our business. We continuously assess our merchandising departments and product lines for opportunities to expand the assortment of products offered within The Home Depot's portfolio of proprietary and exclusive brands.\n\n## Competition and Seasonality\n\nOur industry is highly competitive, very fragmented, and evolving. As a result, we face competition for our products and services from a variety of retailers, suppliers, distributors and manufacturers that sell products directly to their respective customer bases, and service providers, ranging from traditional brick-and-mortar, to multichannel, to exclusively online. These competitors include a number of other home improvement retailers; electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses; and lumber yards. With respect to some products and services, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, paint stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores, MRO distributors, home d\u00e9cor retailers, and other retailers, as well as with providers of home improvement services and tool and equipment rental. The internet facilitates competitive entry, price transparency, and comparison shopping, increasing the level of competition we face.\n\nWe compete primarily based on customer experience, price, quality, product availability and assortment, and delivery options, both in-store and online. We also compete based on store location and appearance, presentation of merchandise, and ease of shopping experience. Furthermore, with respect to delivery options, customers are increasingly seeking faster and/or guaranteed delivery times, low-price or free shipping, and/or convenient pickup options, including curbside pickup. Our ability to be competitive on delivery and pickup times, options and costs depends on many factors, including the success of our supply chain investments, described more fully under 'Our Supply Chain' below.\n\nOur business is subject to seasonal influences.

While in the store, customers may also go online to access ratings and rev iews, compare prices, v iew our extended assortment, and purchase additional products. Our inv estments in a truly interconnected experience are focused on bringing together the power of our physical presence and the frictionless interaction of our digital capabilities.\n\nA significant majority of the traffic in Home Depot's digital channels is on mobile dev ices. Mobile users expect more simplicity and relev ancy in their digital interactions. In addition to supporting our DIY and DIFM customers on their shopping journeys, mobile dev ices can also help serv e the needs of Pros working on complex projects.

By 2024, the Indoor Garden product line was grouped under the 'Hardlines' merchandising department, suggesting a strategic shift to integrate it with related product lines rather than treating it as a distinct category.

      "answer": "The company's approach to accrual rates for vendor funding programs remained methodologically consistent between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024, with no material changes in the recognition methodology over the past three fiscal years. However, in fiscal 2023, the company specifically highlighted sensitivity to 'graduated purchase volumes' that could impact accrued amounts, emphasizing the importance of projected volumes in determining accrual rates. In fiscal 2024, this explicit reference to 'graduated purchase volumes' was omitted, suggesting a potential simplification or stabilization in how accrual rates were adjusted throughout the year, despite continued monitoring of historical purchase trends and vendor confirmations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, the disclosure explicitly mentions that accrual rates are adjusted based on 'programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met', indicating a dynamic sensitivity to volume thresholds.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, while the overall methodology remains unchanged, the specific mention of 'graduated purchase volumes' is no longer included, suggesting a possible evolution in how vendor funding programs were structured or how accruals were managed.",
        "Step 3: The removal of the graduated volume sensitivity in 2024 indicates a subtle but meaningful change in the company's approach to accrual rate assumptions, even though the core policy remained the same."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this Annual Report requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and ex penses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  We base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included herein.  We believe that the following accounting policies affect the most significant estimates and management judgments used in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Merchandise Inventory\n\n## Description\n\nWe record an inventory reserve for the estimated adjustment to mark down merchandise inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value (LCNRV). This reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience.  During fiscal 2024, our reserve decreased approximately $23 million to $222 million as of January 31, 2025.\n\nWe also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories.  This reserve is based primarily on actual shrink results from previous physical inventories.  During fiscal 2024, the inventory shrink reserve increased approximately $2 million to $427 million as of January 31, 2025.\n\nIn addition, we receive funds from vendors in the normal course of business, principally as a result of purchase volumes, early payments, or sales-based promotions of vendors' products.  Generally, these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs that we incurred to sell the vendor's product.  The majority of the vendor funds associated with these purchases are earned under agreements that are negotiated on an annual basis or shorter. The funds are recorded as a reduction to the cost of inventory as they are earned. As the related inventory is sold, the amounts are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales. Funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors' products are recorded as an offset to the related ex pense.\n\n## Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\n\nWe do not believe that our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of markdown in the near term in excess of our established reserves, and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practices based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions. However, changes in consumer purchasing patterns or a deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserves.  Likewise, changes in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary, based on the timing and results of physical inventories.  We also apply judgment in the determination of obsolete inventory and assumptions about net realizable value.\n\nFor vendor funds, we develop accrual rates based on the provisions of the agreements in place.  Due to the diversity of the individual vendor agreements, we perform analyses and review historical purchase trends and volumes throughout the year, adjust accrual rates as appropriate and confirm actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded.  Amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected purchase volumes, especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met.\n\n## Effect if actual results differ from assumptions\n\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves for inventory during the past three fiscal years.  We believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for both of these inventory reserves.  However, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves. A 10% change in either the amount of inventory subject to markdown or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the calculation of our LCNRV inventory reserve would each have affected net earnings by approximately $17 million for fiscal 2024. A 10% change in the estimated shrinkage rate included in the calculation of our inventory shrink reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately $32 million for fiscal 2024.\n\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize vendor funds during the past three fiscal years.  If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we could be exposed to additional adjustments that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory.

These contact centers help Lowe's enable an omnichannel customer experience by providing the ability to tender sales, assist with order management, coordinate deliveries, manage after-sale installations, and answer general customer questions via phone, mail, e-mail, live chat, and social media.\n\n## Our Products\n\n## Product Selection\n\nTo meet customers' varying needs, we offer a complete line of products for construction, maintenance, repair, remodeling, and decorating.  We offer home improvement products in the following categories: Appliances, Seasonal &amp; Outdoor Living, Lumber, Lawn &amp; Garden, Kitchens &amp; Bath, Hardware, Building Materials, Millwork, Paint, Rough Plumbing, Tools, Electrical, Flooring, and D\u00e9cor.  A typical Lowe's-branded home improvement store stocks approximately 40,000 items, with additional items available through our online selling channel. Our product assortments offered in-store strive to meet the needs of the local market for the Pro and DIY customer. See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data', of this Annual Report for historical revenues by product category for each of the last three fiscal years.\n\nWe are committed to offering a wide selection of national brand-name merchandise complemented by our selection of high-value private brands. We are balancing our value-oriented private brands with our national power brands, intensifying our localization efforts and expanding our rural assortment. In addition, we are dedicated to selling products sourced in a socially responsible, efficient, and cost-effective manner.\n\n## Supply Chain\n\nWe source our products from vendors worldwide and believe that alternative and competitive suppliers are available for virtually all of our products. Whenever possible, we purchase directly from manufacturers to provide savings for customers and improve our gross margin.\n\nTo efficiently replenish our stores and meet our customers' expectations for fast fulfillment and delivery, we own and operate more than 120 supply chain facilities in our network. These facilities include regional distribution centers (RDCs), flatbed distribution centers (FDCs), import distribution centers (IDCs), bulk distribution centers (BDCs), cross-dock terminals (XDTs), and Fulfillment Centers (FCs). Fulfillment centers, along with many of our stores, ship product directly to our customers. In addition, we leverage our existing supply chain to deliver directly to our Pro customers. Each one of these distribution nodes plays a critical role in our Total Home strategy and collectively enable our products to get to their destination as efficiently as possible.\n\nThe FDCs distribute merchandise that requires special handling due to size or type of packaging such as lumber, boards, panel products, pipe, siding, ladders, and building materials. On average, each RDC and FDC serves approximately 115 stores. Our Pro fulfillment network stocks deeper quantities of our top Pro assortments and has expanded capabilities to handle large orders on multiple flat bed trucks. Our IDCs were expanded to create more capacity to hold import product at the coast, which improves our network's agility to move inventory where and when it is needed. Our BDCs handle appliances and other big and bulky products, and our XDTs fulfill final mile box  truck deliveries of these products.\n\nOur supply chain supports every pillar of our Total Home strategy, and as such, we continue to invest and transform our network to unlock our omnichannel capabilities while keeping our organization's sustainability goals top of mind. As part of the completion of the rollout of our market-based delivery model, we expanded to additional geographic areas and enhanced our distribution capacity for big and bulky products. As of fiscal year 2024, we have finalized the roll-out of our market-based delivery model.\n\nWe have also been focused on improving the speed of our delivery capabilities for our customers. As of fiscal year 2024, most parcel-eligible items fulfilled by Lowe's can be ordered by a customer and delivered within two business days or less at standard shipping rates. Also, the nationwide expansion of our gig provider network enables same-day delivery of certain products from our stores, and as of fiscal 2024, we have the ability to deliver major appliances next-day in almost every zip code in the United States. Customer needs and buying patterns are constantly changing, and our supply chain will continue to evolve to meet their needs. We are building an omnichannel supply chain that positions the right products in the right quantities in the right places, and operates with greater network capacity with better flow management and optimization.",

      "answer": "In 2023, LOW disclosed forward interest rate swap contracts related to its March 2023 Notes with a notional amount of $2.0 billion, from which it received $247 million upon settlement. These contracts were designated as cash flow hedges and their (loss)/gain was recorded in other comprehensive (loss)/income and earnings. By 2024, the company clarified that its fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as fair value hedges using the shortcut method, under which the hedges are assumed perfectly effective. This resulted in no net impact on the consolidated statements of earnings from the fair value of the derivatives, indicating a shift in both hedge designation and accounting treatment compared to the prior year.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM described its software-enabled services in general terms as part of its broader operations, noting that it 'provides software-enabled services worldwide' and integrates them into its automotive business alongside investments in AV technology and automotive financing. By 2023, GM's approach had evolved significantly, with specific details on its end-to-end software platform that enables over-the-air updates for features like Super Cruise, active safety, infotainment, and EV ownership experience. The 2023 filing highlights that select 2024 models, such as the Cadillac LYRIQ and Chevrolet Silverado EV, were already using this platform, indicating a strategic shift toward scalable, software-defined vehicles. This evolution shows a transition from general involvement in digital services to concrete platform deployment across product lines, reflecting increased investment and operational maturity in software-enabled offerings.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Note 1. Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation\n\nGeneral Motors Company was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 2009. We design, build and sell trucks, crossovers, cars and  automobile  parts,  provide  software-enabled  services  worldwide  and  are  investing  in  and  growing  an A V  business.  We  also provide  automotive  financing  services  through  GM  Financial.  We  analyze  the  results  of  our  operations  through  the  following segments:  GMNA,  GMI,  Cruise  and  GM  Financial.  Cruise  is  our  global  segment  responsible  for  the  development  and commercialization  of  AV  technology.  Nonsegment  operations  are  classified  as  Corporate.  Corporate  includes  certain  centrally recorded  income  and  costs  such  as  interest,  income  taxes,  corporate  expenditures  and  certain  nonsegment-specific  revenues  and expenses. The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Except for per share amounts or as otherwise specified, amounts presented within tables are stated in millions.\n\nPrinciples  of  Consolidation We  consolidate  entities  that  we  control  due  to  ownership  of  a  majority  voting  interest  and  we consolidate variable interest entities (VIEs) when we are the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been  eliminated  in  consolidation.  Our  share  of  earnings  or  losses  of  nonconsolidated  affiliates  is  included  in  our  consolidated operating results using the equity method of accounting when we are able to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial decisions of the affiliate.\n\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of the Financial Statements Accounting estimates are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements. These estimates require the use of judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,  the  disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities  at  the  date  of  the  financial  statements  and  the  reported  amounts  of revenues and expenses in the periods presented. We believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in making estimates, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods.\n\nGM Financial The amounts presented for GM Financial have been adjusted to reflect the impact on GM Financial's deferred tax positions and provision for income taxes resulting from the inclusion of GM Financial in our consolidated tax return and to eliminate the  effect  of  transactions  between  GM  Financial  and  the  other  members  of  the  consolidated  group.  Accordingly,  the  amounts presented will differ from those presented by GM Financial on a stand-alone basis.\n\n## Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies\n\nThe accounting policies that follow are utilized by our automotive, automotive financing and Cruise operations, unless otherwise indicated.  We  adopted  Accounting  Standards  Update  (ASU)  2016-13  \"Financial  Instruments  -  Credit  Losses  (Topic  326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\" (ASU 2016-13) on January 1, 2020 on a modified retrospective basis. As such, the comparative information in prior periods was not restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The accounting policies for Marketable Debt Securities, Accounts and Notes Receivable and GM Financial Receivables that were affected by the adoption of ASU 2016-13 became effective on January 1, 2020.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nAutomotive Automotive  net  sales  and  revenue  represents  the  amount  of  consideration  to  which  we  expect  to  be  entitled  in exchange  for  vehicle,  parts  and  accessories  and  services  and  other  sales.  The  consideration  recognized  represents  the  amount received, typically shortly after the sale to a customer, net of estimated dealer and customer sales incentives we reasonably expect to pay.  Significant  factors  in  determining  our  estimates  of  incentives  include  forecasted  sales  volume,  product  mix  and  the  rate  of customer acceptance of incentive programs, all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning future  customer  behavior  and  market  conditions.  Subsequent  adjustments  to  incentive  estimates  are  possible  as  facts  and circumstances change over time. A portion of the consideration received is deferred for separate performance obligations, such as maintenance and vehicle connectivity, that will be provided to our customers at a future date. Taxes assessed by various government entities, such as sales, use and value-added taxes, collected at the time of the vehicle sale are excluded from Automotive net sales and revenue. Costs for shipping and handling activities that occur after control of the vehicle transfers to the dealer are recognized at the time of sale and presented in Automotive and other cost of sales.\n\nVehicle, Parts and Accessories For the majority of vehicle and accessories sales, our customers obtain control and we recognize revenue when the vehicle transfers to the dealer, which generally occurs when the vehicle is released to the carrier responsible for transporting it to a dealer. Revenue, net of estimated returns, is recognized on the sale of parts upon delivery to the customer. When our customers have a right to return eligible parts and accessories, we consider the returns in our estimation of the transaction price.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM Financial was described as a segment through which General Motors provides automotive financing services, with its financials adjusted to reflect the impact of consolidated tax returns and intercompany transactions. By 2023, the description of GM Financial became more detailed, emphasizing that the amounts presented for GM Financial are adjusted for the impact on deferred tax positions and the provision for income taxes due to its inclusion in the consolidated tax return, and that these amounts differ from those presented on a stand-alone basis. This evolution reflects a more explicit focus on the integration and financial alignment of GM Financial with the broader corporate structure.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, GM Financial is described as a segment offering automotive financing services, with adjustments for consolidated tax returns and intercompany transactions noted briefly.",

        "Step 3: The change reflects a transformation in how GM Financial's role is characterized \u2014 from a general mention of integration in 2022 to a more detailed explanation of its financial alignment with the parent company in 2023."

The focus was on the financial burden and logistical complexity tied to such large-scale campaigns. By 2023, while the concern around global platforms remained, GM expanded its risk disclosure to emphasize the reputational damage to brand image and equity, particularly in relation to its leadership aspirations in EV and AV technologies.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nIn addition, many of our advanced technologies, including AVs, present novel issues with which domestic and foreign regulators have only limited experience, and will be subject to evolving regulatory frameworks. Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM highlighted its joint venture, Ultium Cells LLC, with LG Energy Solution, as a key part of its EV strategy to mass-produce battery cells across three U.S. plants. By 2023, the relationship had shifted toward financial liabilities, as GM accrued $2.6 billion related to the Chevrolet Bolt EV battery recall, with $1.6 billion recognized as receivables from LG. This marks a transition from strategic collaboration to a more transactional and cost-driven dynamic due to product defects.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, GM described a strategic partnership with LG Energy Solution through Ultium Cells LLC, focusing on joint battery cell production for EVs across multiple U.S. facilities.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, GM reported a financial liability of $2.6 billion related to the Chevrolet Bolt EV recall, with LG agreeing to reimburse certain costs, indicating a shift from collaboration to cost recovery.",
        "Step 3: The relationship evolved from strategic joint venture activity in 2022 to a financially driven arrangement in 2023 due to recall-related liabilities."

Business\n\nGeneral  Motors  Company  (sometimes  referred  to  as  we,  our,  us,  ourselves,  the  Company,  General  Motors,  or  GM)  was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 2009. We design, build and sell trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts and provide software-enabled services and subscriptions worldwide. Our automotive operations meet the demands of our customers through our automotive segments: GM North America (GMNA) and GM International (GMI) with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. We also have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet the demands of customers in other countries,  primarily  in  China,  with  vehicles  developed,  manufactured  and/or  marketed  under  the Baojun,  Buick,  Cadillac,  Chevrolet  and  Wuling  brands.  Cruise  is  our  global  segment  responsible  for  the  development  and commercialization  of  autonomous  vehicle  technology.  We  provide  automotive  financing  services  through  our  General  Motors Financial  Company,  Inc.  (GM  Financial)  segment.  Refer  to  Part  II,  Item  7.  Management's  Discussion  and Analysis  of  Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&amp;A) and Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements for financial information about our  segments.  Except  for  per  share  amounts  or  as  otherwise  specified,  amounts  presented  within  tables  are  stated  in  millions. Forward-looking  statements  in  this  Business  section  are  not  guarantees  of  future  performance  and  may  involve  risks  and uncertainties  that  could  cause  actual  results  to  differ  materially  from  those  projected.  Refer  to  Item  1A.  Risk  Factors  and  the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" section of Part II, Item 7. MD&amp;A for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties.\n\nOur vision for the future is a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion, which guides our growth-focused strategy to invest in electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs), software-enabled services and subscriptions and new business  opportunities,  while  strengthening  our  market  position  in  profitable  internal  combustion  engine  (ICE)  vehicles,  such  as trucks and sport utility vehicles (SUVs). We have committed to an all-electric future with a core focus on zero emission battery EVs as  part  of  our  long-term  strategy  to  reduce  petroleum  consumption  and  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions. As  a  result,  we  have committed to making total EV and AV investments of more than $35.0 billion from 2020 through 2025.\n\nWe have an opportunity to grow our vehicle and financing revenue by continuing to capitalize on the strength of our franchises and scaling our EV production and customer base over the next decade. We also have the potential of growing our revenue through our software-enabled services and subscriptions, including OnStar, our advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS), Super Cruise, and  future  offerings,  such  as  our  next-generation  ADAS,  Ultra  Cruise,  and  Ultifi.  Additionally,  we  are  incubating  several  new businesses with a start-up mindset that we believe will enable us to attract new customers and generate revenues in new areas.\n\nElectric Vehicles We plan to launch more than 30 EVs globally by 2025. A key element in our EV strategy is Ultium, our all-new dedicated battery electric platform. Our first Ultium-based products launched with the GMC HUMMER EV and BrightDrop EV600 in  2021,  to  be  followed  by  the  Cadillac  LYRIQ  in  2022. This  all-new  platform  is  flexible  and  will  be  leveraged  across  multiple brands and vehicle sizes, styles and drive configurations, allowing for quick response to customer preferences and a shorter design and development lead time compared to our ICE vehicles.\n\nIn September 2021, we announced three new drive assist motors as part of Ultium Drive, calibrated in-house to ensure the highest level of performance in Ultium-based EVs. We designed the motors as a scalable family, sharing design principles as well as similar tooling and manufacturing strategies.\n\nIn November 2021, we began production at GM's Factory ZERO Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Center (Factory ZERO), which was re-tooled into a fully dedicated EV facility to produce the GMC HUMMER EV and the upcoming Cruise Origin and Chevrolet Silverado EV, which we revealed in January 2022 at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada. In January 2022, we announced that we will convert our assembly plant in Orion Township, Michigan for production of the Chevrolet Silverado EV and the  electric  GMC  Sierra. Additionally,  we  have  announced  plans  to  mass-produce  battery  cells  for  these  and  other  future  EVs through Ultium Cells LLC (an equally owned joint venture with LG Energy Solution) in Lordstown, Ohio, Spring Hill, Tennessee and Lansing, Michigan. A fourth U.S.-based battery cell plant is also planned by mid-decade.\n\nTo  support  mass  market  adoption  of  EVs,  we  are  working  to  ensure  that  our  customers  will  have  access  to  comprehensive charging solutions. For personal vehicles, this means strategically addressing charging needs at home, the workplace and in public locations.  For  fleet  vehicles,  this  means  turnkey  charging  solutions  and  fleet  and  facility  energy  management  services. We  have announced collaborative work with several charge network operators to filter real-time data on their respective",

      "answer": "In 2022, General Motors reported a direct financial investment of $0.5 billion in Ultium Cells LLC as part of its investing activities. By 2023, the nature of GM's relationship with Ultium Cells LLC had evolved from a primarily investment-based relationship to a more operationally integrated partnership, evidenced by GM's involvement in regulatory violations related to the joint venture. Specifically, in February 2023, GM self-disclosed potential violations of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) related to Ultium Cells LLC to the EPA, which resulted in a November 2023 settlement involving joint civil penalties estimated at approximately $5.1 million. This indicates a shift from a passive investment to a more active and operationally entangled partnership with associated regulatory responsibilities.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, GM's relationship with Ultium Cells LLC was characterized by a direct financial investment of $0.5 billion, as disclosed in the investing activities section.",

        "Step 3: The change from a financial investment to an operationally entangled partnership indicates a transformation in the nature of GM\u2019s relationship with Ultium Cells LLC, with increased regulatory exposure and shared liabilities."

The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement amends and restates the Company's amended and restated credit agreement, dated September 10, 2018 (the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement), to among other things (i) extend the maturity date of the revolving credit facility to December 2026 and (ii) increase the aggregate availability to a total of $2.0 billion. Borrowings under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement will bear interest calculated according to a Base Rate or a Eurocurrency Rate, plus an applicable margin.\n\nAlso in December 2021, the Company amended the five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement dated March 23, 2020 (the 2020 Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks. The amendment, among other things, increased the availability of the unsecured revolving credit agreement to $2.0 billion, maturing in March 2025. Borrowings under the 2020 Credit Agreement will bear interest calculated according to a Base Rate or a Eurocurrency Rate, plus an applicable margin.\n\nSubject to obtaining commitments from the lenders and satisfying other conditions specified in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and the 2020 Credit Agreement (collectively, the Credit Agreements), the Company may increase the combined aggregate availability of both agreements by an additional $1.0 billion. The Credit Agreements contain customary representations, warranties, and covenants for transactions of these type. The Company was in compliance with those financial covenants at January 28, 2022.\n\nThe Credit Agreements support the Company's commercial paper program. The amounts available to be drawn under the Credit Agreements are reduced by the amount of borrowings under the commercial paper program.

      "answer": "In 2022, Kitchens & Bath was grouped under the Home D\u00e9cor division alongside categories like Appliances, D\u00e9cor, Flooring, and Paint, suggesting a more design-focused positioning. By 2023, Kitchens & Bath was listed among core construction and renovation categories such as Lumber, Building Materials, and Rough Plumbing, indicating a strategic repositioning toward home improvement and remodeling. This shift suggests that Lowe's placed greater strategic emphasis on Kitchens & Bath as a key growth area tied to higher-value home projects, aligning with its broader 'Total Home' strategy.",

        "In 2022, Kitchens & Bath was categorized under Home D\u00e9cor, a grouping that emphasizes aesthetics and interior design.",
        "In 2023, Kitchens & Bath was moved to a grouping that includes construction and infrastructure categories like Lumber, Rough Plumbing, and Building Materials.",
        "This reclassification indicates a shift in strategic positioning from a d\u00e9cor-focused product line to a core home improvement offering, likely reflecting stronger sales performance or strategic investment in remodeling services."

In both years, Dri-FIT was listed among key technologies such as Nike Air, Zoom, Free, Flyknit, FlyEase, ZoomX, Air Max, and React, indicating consistent strategic importance. The exact same language was used in both the 2023 and 2024 10-K filings, showing no change in the description or emphasis of Dri-FIT's role in Nike\u2019s innovation strategy.",

        "Step 1: In the 2023 filing, Dri-FIT is explicitly named as one of Nike's key technologies, appearing in the product research, design, and development section alongside other technologies like Nike Air and Flyknit.",
        "Step 2: In the 2024 filing, the exact same language is used, with Dri-FIT again appearing in the same list of key technologies, indicating no change in strategic emphasis.",
        "Step 3: The repetition of identical language across both years demonstrates that Nike's strategic emphasis on Dri-FIT did not evolve or change during this time period."

Technical innovation in the design and m anufacturing process of footwear, apparel and athletic equipm ent receives continued em phasis as we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic perform ance, reduce injury and m axim ize com fort, while decreasing our environm ental im pact.\n\nI n addition to our own staff of specialists in the areas of biom echanics, chem istry, exercise physiology, engineering, digital technologies, industrial design, sustainability and related fields, we also utilize research com m ittees and advisory boards m ade up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipm ent m anagers, orthopedists, podiatrists, physicians and other experts who consult with us and review certain designs, m aterials and concepts for product and m anufacturing, design and other process im provem ents and com pliance with product safety regulations around the world. E m ployee athletes, athletes engaged under sports m arketing contracts and other athletes wear-test and evaluate products during the design and developm ent process.\n\nAs we continue to develop new technologies, we are sim ultaneously focused on the design of innovative products and experiences incorporating such technologies throughout our product categories and consum er applications. U sing m arket intelligence and research, our various design team s identify opportunities to leverage new technologies in existing categories to respond to consum er preferences. The proliferation of N ike Air, Zoom , F ree, D ri-F IT , F lyknit, F lyE ase, Zoom X, Air M ax, and R eact technologies, am ong others, typifies our dedication to designing innovative products.\n\n## MANUFACTURING\n\nNearly all of our footwear and apparel products are m anufactured outside the U nited States by independent contract m anufacturers (\"contract m anufacturers\"), m any of which operate m ultiple factories. W e are also supplied, prim arily indirectly, by a num ber of m aterials, or \"T ier 2\" suppliers, who provide the principal m aterials used in footwear and apparel finished goods products. As of M ay 31, 2024, we had 169 strategic Tier 2 suppliers.\n\nAs of M ay 31, 2024, our contract m anufacturers operated 96 finished goods footwear factories located in 11 countries. For fiscal 2024, N IKE  Brand footwear finished goods were manufactured by 15 contract m anufacturers, m any of which operate m ultiple factories. T he largest single finished goods footwear factory accounted for approxim ately 9% of total fiscal 2024 N IKE  Brand footwear production. F or fiscal 2024, factories in Vietnam , Indonesia and C hina m anufactured approxim ately 50%, 27% and 18% of total N IKE  Brand footwear, respectively.

      "question": "How has Nike's treatment of Nike Air technology evolved in its product development strategy between fiscal years 2023 and 2024?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2023, Nike Air was described as part of a list of technologies that 'typifies our dedication to designing innovative products,' indicating it was still being actively proliferated across product lines. By fiscal 2024, Nike Air was again listed among key technologies, but now embedded alongside mature technologies like Zoom, Free, and React, suggesting that Nike Air had become a standard component of Nike\u2019s broader innovation platform rather than a distinct growth driver. This reflects a strategic shift from emphasizing Nike Air as an emerging innovation to treating it as an integrated, foundational offering within Nike\u2019s product development framework.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In fiscal 2023, Nike Air was described as part of the 'proliferation' of technologies, indicating active expansion and emphasis in product development.",
        "Step 2: In fiscal 2024, Nike Air was listed among other established technologies, suggesting it had transitioned to a more mature and standard component of Nike's innovation portfolio.",
        "Step 3: The change in positioning indicates a strategic evolution from growth-phase innovation to a stable, integrated product technology."

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2023, Nike's relationship with APLA was characterized by direct operational involvement, with the region being one of the geographies where certain employees were represented by trade unions, indicating a more localized and embedded workforce structure. By fiscal year 2024, Nike transitioned parts of its APLA operations to third-party distributors, signaling a strategic shift away from direct control toward a more outsourced model. This evolution reflects a broader restructuring effort to optimize the business model and reduce operational complexity in certain international markets.",

These rates are set approxim ately nine and twelve m onths in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons, and one standard rate applies to the spring and sum m er selling seasons) based on average m arket spot rates in the calendar m onth preceding the date they are established. Inventories and C ost of sales for geographic operating segm ents and C onverse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases in the entity's functional currency. D ifferences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual m arket rates are included in C orporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from  the C om pany's centrally m anaged foreign exchange risk m anagem ent program  and other conversion gains and losses.\n\nAccounts receivable, net, Inventories and P roperty, plant and equipm ent, net for operating segm ents are regularly reviewed by m anagem ent and are therefore provided below.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 86",

      "question": "How has Nike's relationship with Converse evolved in terms of revenue performance and strategic positioning between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2023, Converse revenues decreased by 15% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by declines in North America and Western Europe, with both wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels experiencing drops in unit sales and average selling price. By fiscal 2024, Converse was described as a wholly-owned subsidiary that operates on a stand-alone basis, indicating a strategic shift toward maintaining it as a distinct brand within Nike\u2019s portfolio. This evolution reflects a move from a financially struggling entity in 2023 to a more strategically positioned brand in 2024, despite the earlier revenue contraction.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In fiscal 2023, Converse experienced a 15% revenue decline on a currency-neutral basis, with a 12% drop in unit sales and a 3% decrease in ASP, primarily due to underperformance in North America and Western Europe.",
        "Step 2: In fiscal 2024, Converse is explicitly referred to as a wholly-owned subsidiary that operates on a stand-alone basis, signaling a strategic emphasis on its brand identity and positioning within Nike\u2019s broader portfolio.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a shift from a financially underperforming segment in 2023 to a more strategically embedded brand in 2024, indicating a transformation in Nike\u2019s approach to managing and positioning Converse."

      "answer": "In 2022, McDonald's characterized food safety concerns primarily as reputational risks that could impact brand perception and financial results due to incidents like food-borne illness or contamination. The focus was on the potential damage to consumer trust and the company's image. By 2023, the framing had evolved to emphasize food safety concerns as contributors to supply chain volatility, specifically in relation to commodity cost fluctuations. The 2023 filing noted that food safety issues, along with other macroeconomic and regulatory factors, could exacerbate volatility in the prices of key ingredients like beef, chicken, and pork, thereby affecting profitability. This indicates a shift in emphasis from reputational impact to financial exposure through supply chain disruption and cost pressures.",

          "chunk_text": "## Challenges with respect to labor, including availability and cost, could impact our business and results of operations.\n\nOur success depends in part on our System's ability to proactively recruit, motivate and retain qualified individuals to work in McDonald's restaurants and to maintain appropriately-staffed restaurants in an intensely competitive labor market. If we or our franchisees are unable to adequately staff McDonald's restaurants, it could negatively impact our operations, including speed of service to customers, and customer satisfaction levels. The System's ability to meet its labor needs is generally subject to external factors, including the availability of sufficient workforce, unemployment levels and prevailing wages in the markets in which we operate.\n\nFurther, increased costs and competition associated with recruiting, motivating and retaining qualified employees, as well as costs associated with promoting awareness of the opportunities of working at McDonald's restaurants, could have a negative impact on our Companyoperated margins and our franchisees' profitability.\n\nWe are also impacted by the costs and other effects of compliance with U.S. and international regulations affecting our workforce, which includes our staff and employees working in our Company-operated restaurants. These regulations are increasingly focused on employment issues, including wage and hour, healthcare, immigration, retirement and other employee benefits and workplace practices. Claims of noncompliance with these regulations could result in liability and expense to us. Our potential exposure to reputational and other harm regarding our workplace practices or conditions or those of our independent franchisees or suppliers, including those giving rise to claims of harassment or discrimination (or perceptions thereof) or workplace safety, could have a negative impact on consumer perceptions of us and our business. Additionally, economic action, such as boycotts, protests, work stoppages or campaigns by labor organizations, could adversely affect us (including our ability to recruit, motivate and retain talent) or our franchisees and suppliers, whose performance may have a significant impact on our results.\n\n## Effective succession planning is important to our continued success.\n\nEffective succession planning is important to our long-term success. Failure to effectively identify, develop and retain key personnel, recruit high-quality candidates and ensure smooth management and personnel transitions could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results.\n\n## Food safety concerns may have an adverse effect on our business.\n\nOur ability to increase sales and profits depends on our System's ability to meet expectations for safe food and on our ability to manage the potential impact on McDonald's of food-borne illnesses and food or product safety issues that may arise in the future, including in the supply chain, restaurants or delivery. Food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe food products, including as our menu and service model evolve. However, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness, occur within the food industry and our System from time to time and could occur in the future. Instances of food tampering, food contamination or food-borne illness, whether actual or perceived, could adversely affect our brand and reputation, as well as our financial results.\n\n## If we do not effectively manage our real estate portfolio, our operating results may be negatively impacted.\n\nWe have significant real estate operations, primarily in connection with our restaurant business. We generally own or secure a long-term lease on the land and building for conventional franchised and Company-operated restaurant sites. We seek to identify and develop restaurant locations that offer convenience to customers and long-term sales and profit potential. As we generally secure long-term real estate interests for our restaurants, we have limited flexibility to quickly alter our real estate portfolio. The competitive business landscape continues to evolve in light of changing business trends, consumer preferences, trade area demographics, consumer use of digital, delivery and drive thru, local competitive positions and other economic factors. If our restaurants are not located in desirable locations, or if we do not evolve in response to these factors, it could adversely affect Systemwide sales and profitability.\n\nOur real estate values and the costs associated with our real estate operations are also impacted by a variety of other factors, including governmental regulations, insurance, zoning, tax and eminent domain laws, interest rate levels and the cost of financing. A significant change in real estate values, or an increase in costs as a result of any of these factors, could adversely affect our operating results.\n\n## Information technology system failures or interruptions, or breaches of network security, may impact our operations or cause reputational harm.\n\nWe are increasingly reliant upon technology systems, such as point-of-sale, technologies that support our digital and delivery solutions, and technologies that facilitate communication and collaboration with affiliated entities, customers, employees, franchisees, suppliers, service providers or other independent third parties to conduct our business, whether developed and maintained by us or provided by third parties. Any failure or interruption of these systems could significantly impact our or our franchisees' operations, or our customers' experience and perceptions.\n\nSecurity incidents or breaches have from time to time occurred and may in the future occur involving our systems, the systems of the parties we communicate or collaborate with (including franchisees) or the systems of third-party providers. These may include such things as unauthorized access, phishing attacks, account takeovers, denial of service, computer viruses, introduction of malware or ransomware and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Certain of these technology systems contain personal, financial and other information of our customers, employees, franchisees, business customers and other third parties, as well as financial, proprietary and other confidential information related to our business. Despite response procedures and measures in place in the event of an incident, a security breach could result in disruptions, shutdowns, or the theft or unauthorized disclosure of such information. The actual or alleged occurrence of any of these incidents could result in mitigation costs, reputational damage, adverse publicity, loss of consumer confidence, reduced sales and profits, complications in executing our growth initiatives and regulatory and legal risk, including criminal penalties or civil liabilities.\n\nWe also provide certain technology systems to businesses that are unaffiliated with the McDonald's System and a failure, interruption or breach of these systems may cause harm to those unaffiliated parties, which may result in liability to us or reputational harm.",

      "answer": "In 2022, McDonald's disclosed that it had deferred approximately $1 billion in rent and royalties from franchisees, primarily during the first half of 2020, due to the impact of government restrictions related to COVID-19. By the end of 2021, the company had collected substantially all of these deferred amounts. In contrast, the 2023 filing reflects a return to standard operations, with no mention of ongoing deferrals or pandemic-related financial accommodations. Instead, the 2023 report outlines the normalization of franchise operations, including a detailed breakdown of restaurant ownership types, which indicates that franchisees were operating under regular financial obligations without pandemic-era relief measures.",

        "Step 3: The financial relationship between McDonald's and its franchisees evolved from one requiring temporary relief in 2022 to a normalized state in 2023, indicating a strategic and operational shift as the business environment stabilized post-pandemic."

          "chunk_text": "\nThe results of operations of restaurant businesses purchased and sold in transactions with franchisees were not material either individually or in the aggregate to the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to purchase and sale.\n\n## CONSOLIDATION\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Investments in affiliates owned 50% or less (primarily McDonald's China and Japan) are accounted for by the equity method.\n\nOn an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its business relationships such as those with franchisees, joint venture partners, developmental licensees, suppliers and advertising cooperatives to identify potential variable interest entities. Generally, these businesses qualify for a scope exception under the variable interest entity consolidation guidance. The Company has concluded that consolidation of any such entity is not appropriate for the periods presented.\n\n## ESTIMATES IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\n## FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION\n\nGenerally, the functional currency of operations outside the U.S. is the respective local currency.\n\n## RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIn December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') issued Accounting Standard Update ('ASU') No. 2019-12, 'Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes' ('ASU 2019-12'), which simplifies the accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including applicable interim periods. The Company adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2021. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\n\n## Reference Rate Reform\n\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, 'Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting\" ('ASU 2020-04'). The pronouncement provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the current guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. The guidance was effective upon issuance and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated on or before December 31, 2022. The adoption of ASU 2020-04 will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Leases\n\nIn July 2021, the FASB issued No. ASU 2021-05, \"Leases (Topic 842): Lessors-Certain Leases with Variable Lease Payments\" (\"ASU 202105\"). The pronouncement amends the current guidance on classification for a lease that includes variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate. Under the amended guidance, a lessor must classify as an operating lease any lease that would otherwise be classified as a sales-type or direct financing lease and that would result in the recognition of a selling loss at lease commencement. ASU 2021-05 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including applicable interim periods. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.",

We use the net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper for general corporate purposes.\n\nWe have a $15.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (the 'Credit Agreement'), with a term that extends to November 2028 and may be extended for one or more additional one-year terms subject to approval by the lenders. The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the Credit Agreement is the applicable benchmark rate specified in the Credit Agreement plus 0.45%, with a commitment fee of 0.03% on the undrawn portion of the credit facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2023 and 2024.\n\nIn October 2024, we entered into a $5.0 billion unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (the 'Short-Term Credit Agreement'), which replaced the prior 364-day revolving credit agreement entered into in November 2023. The Short-Term Credit Agreement matures in October 2025 and may be extended for one additional period of 364 days subject to approval by the lenders. The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the Short-Term Credit Agreement is the Secured Overnight Financing Rate specified in the Short-Term Credit Agreement plus 0.45%, with a commitment fee of 0.03% on the undrawn portion. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Short-Term Credit Agreement or the prior 364-day revolving credit agreement as of December 31, 2023 and 2024.\n\nWe also utilize other short-term credit facilities for working capital purposes. There were $147 million and $151 million of borrowings outstanding under these facilities as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, which were included in 'Accrued expenses and other' on our consolidated balance sheets.

      "answer": "In 2023, the 3.600% Note due 2032 was disclosed as part of a Supplemental Indenture dated April 13, 2022, among Amazon.com, Inc., Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (as prior trustee), and Computershare Trust Company, National Association (as successor trustee). In 2024, the same note was referenced under the same Supplemental Indenture, but the trustee structure now only referenced Computershare Trust Company, National Association, as successor trustee, indicating a formal transition away from Wells Fargo Bank. This reflects a procedural evolution in the administration of the note, with no changes to the note\u2019s terms or interest rate, but a shift in the trustee relationship.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, the 3.600% Note due 2032 was described in Exhibit 4.2 as part of a Supplemental Indenture involving both Wells Fargo Bank and Computershare Trust Company as successor trustee.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the same note was again referenced in Exhibit 4.2, but the trustee structure now only included Computershare Trust Company, National Association, indicating Wells Fargo Bank was no longer involved.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a procedural evolution in the administration of the note, with a shift in trustee responsibilities, but no change in the note\u2019s terms or interest rate."

      "question": "How did Amazon's financial investment and valuation approach toward Anthropic, PBC evolve from 2023 to 2024, particularly in terms of investment classification and the factors affecting its valuation?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Amazon disclosed a $1.25 billion convertible note investment in Anthropic, PBC, classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in 'Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).' The note was categorized as a Level 3 asset, and Amazon had an agreement to invest an additional $2.75 billion in a second convertible note by Q1 2024. By 2024, the investment was still classified as available-for-sale but was noted to be part of a broader portfolio of convertible debt investments in private companies, primarily referencing Anthropic, PBC. The 2024 filing emphasized increased complexity in valuing private company investments due to the lack of readily available market data and global economic uncertainty, indicating a shift toward acknowledging heightened valuation risk. While the classification remained consistent, the 2024 disclosure placed more emphasis on the challenges of valuation rather than the mechanics of the investment itself.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk\n\nDuring 2024, net sales from our International segment accounted for 22% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from ex pectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales decreased by $1.8 billion in comparison with the prior year.\n\nWe have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities ('foreign funds'). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of December 31, 2024, of $25.5 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in declines of $1.3 billion, $2.6 billion, and $5.1 billion.\n\nWe also have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of December 31, 2024, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange rates would result in losses of $305 million, $605 million, and $1.2 billion, recorded to 'Other income (expense), net.'\n\nSee Item 7 of Part II, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations - Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates' for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates.\n\n## Equity Investment Risk\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, our recorded value in equity, equity warrant, and convertible debt investments in public and private companies was $22.1 billion. Our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies, which include our equity investment in Rivian, represent $4.6 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2024, and are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. We record our equity warrant investments in private companies at fair value and adjust our equity investments in private companies for observable price changes or impairments. We record our available-for-sale convertible debt investments in private companies at fair value, which primarily relate to Anthropic, PBC. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. The current global economic conditions provide additional uncertainty. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable.

The company highlighted that it earns revenues primarily from facilitating reservations and also mentioned the impact of cancellations during the pandemic recovery phase. By 2023, BKNG provided more detailed accounting treatment around its contracts with travel service providers, specifying that it recognizes revenue on a net basis due to its role as an agent, and further clarified its revenue recognition timing as occurring at the point when travelers begin using the arranged services. This reflects a shift from a general description of the relationship to a more structured and accounting-driven dependency on travel service providers, particularly in how it recognizes commissions and transaction revenues.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, BKNG described its role as connecting consumers with travel service providers and noted the impact of cancellations on its business model.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, BKNG detailed its revenue recognition policy, stating that it recognizes revenue on a net basis because it does not deliver travel services and clarified that revenue is recognized when post-booking services are complete and travel services begin.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a more formalized and accounting-compliant framing of the relationship, indicating a shift from a general partnership model to a more structured dependency governed by contractual and financial reporting standards."

          "chunk_text": "## Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements, including the notes to those statements, and the Section entitled \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\" included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in any forward-looking statements, which may be due to factors discussed in \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nWe evaluate certain operating and financial measures on both an as-reported and constant-currency basis. We calculate constant currency by converting our current-year period operating and financial results for transactions recorded in currencies other than U.S. Dollars using the corresponding prior-year period monthly average exchange rates rather than the current-year period monthly average exchange rates.\n\n## Overview\n\nOur mission is to make it easier for everyone to experience the world. We connect consumers who wish to make travel reservations with travel service providers around the world through our online platforms. Consumers can also use our meta-search services to easily compare travel reservation information from hundreds of online travel platforms at once. We also offer various other services to consumers and partners, such as travel-related insurance products and restaurant management services to restaurants.\n\nWe offer these services through six primary consumer-facing brands: Booking.com, Priceline, agoda, Rentalcars.com, KAYAK, and OpenTable. We continue to increase the collaboration, cooperation, and interdependency among our brands to provide consumers with the most comprehensive services. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements Segment Reporting for information on our operating segments.\n\nThe results of our business outside of the U.S. consist of the results of Booking.com, agoda, and Rentalcars.com in their entirety and the parts of the KAYAK and OpenTable businesses located outside of the U.S. This classification is independent of where the consumer resides, where the consumer is physically located while using our services, or the location of the travel service provider or restaurant. For example, a reservation made through Booking.com (which is domiciled in the Netherlands) at a hotel in New York by a consumer in the U.S. is part of the results of our businesses outside of the U.S. In 2021, the revenues from our businesses outside of the U.S. (the substantial majority of which is generated by Booking.com through facilitating accommodation reservations) represented approximately 87% of our consolidated revenues. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more geographic information.\n\nWe derive substantially all of our revenues from enabling consumers to make travel service reservations. We also earn revenues from advertising services, restaurant reservations and restaurant management services, and various other services, such as travelrelated insurance revenues.\n\n## Trends\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting implementation of travel restrictions by governments around the world resulted in a significant decline in travel activities and consumer demand for related services in 2020 in particular. Accommodation room nights, which include the impact of cancellations, declined rapidly as the COVID-19 pandemic spread in the first quarter of 2020 and the beginning of the second quarter of 2020. Since the beginning of the second quarter of 2020 and through 2021, accommodation room night declines versus the comparable period in 2019 have generally improved as government-imposed travel restrictions have eased, vaccines and other medical interventions have become more widespread, and consumer demand for travel has started to rebound. However, there have been periods of worsening trends due to spikes in COVID-19 cases and newly implemented travel restrictions, primarily related to new variants.",

Business\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has continued to profoundly impact our business, employees, partners, consumers, communities, and stockholders. We were encouraged to see the distribution of vaccines and the development of other medical interventions to COVID-19 during 2021, but the emergence of new variants continues to make the shape and timing of a recovery uncertain. We remain confident that over time there will be a strong recovery for travel demand globally, and are focused on executing on our key strategic priorities so we emerge from this period in a position of strength. As we continue our efforts to make our brands the most trusted and convenient platforms for consumers and partners, we have taken important actions in 2021 including:\n\n- expanding and enhancing our flight product at Booking.com, which is a key component of our Connected Trip vision;\n- entering into an agreement to acquire Etraveli Group in November and completing our acquisition of Getaroom in December;\n- increasing our internal collaboration efforts;\n- continuing to build out our payments platform and payments capabilities across the Company; and\n- launching new product features to make travel more sustainable and inclusive.\n\nOur mission to make it easier for everyone to experience the world remains unchanged. We seek to empower people to cut through travel barriers, such as money, time, language, and overwhelming options, so they can use our services to easily and confidently get where they want to go, stay where they want to stay, dine where they want to dine, pay how they want to pay, and experience what they want to experience. We connect consumers wishing to make travel reservations with travel service providers around the world through our online platforms, which allow consumers to: book a broad array of accommodations (including hotels, motels, resorts, homes, apartments, bed and breakfasts, hostels, and other alternative and traditional accommodations properties) and a flight to their destination; make a car rental reservation or arrange for an airport taxi; make a dinner reservation; or book a vacation package, tour, activity, or cruise. Consumers can also use our meta-search services to easily compare travel reservation information, such as flight, hotel, and rental car reservations, from hundreds of online travel platforms at once. In addition, we offer other services to consumers and partners, such as travel-related insurance products and restaurant management services to restaurants.\n\nWe offer these services through six primary consumer-facing brands: Booking.com, Priceline, agoda, Rentalcars.com, KAYAK, and OpenTable. We continue to increase the collaboration, cooperation, and interdependency among our brands to provide consumers with the most comprehensive services and maximize the benefits of our scale.

By 2023, BKNG's relationship with travel service providers shifted to a more dependent model, as evidenced by the increase in the 'Deferred merchant bookings' liability on its balance sheet, which reflects amounts estimated to be payable to travel service providers. Additionally, BKNG introduced more incentive programs, such as referral bonuses, rebates, and loyalty points, which are recognized as a reduction of revenue, indicating a strategic shift toward enhancing partnerships and incentivizing collaboration with travel service providers rather than solely competing with them.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, BKNG viewed travel service providers primarily as competitors, as stated in the 'Competition' section, where BKNG outlined the intense and evolving nature of competition in the online travel market.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, BKNG's relationship with travel service providers evolved into a more interdependent one, as seen in the 'Deferred merchant bookings' line item, which increased due to higher business volumes and represented amounts payable to these providers, and the introduction of incentive programs to encourage collaboration.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a strategic shift from a competitive stance to a more cooperative one, with BKNG increasingly relying on and financially engaging with travel service providers through deferred liabilities and incentive structures."

          "chunk_text": "## Marketing and Brand Awareness\n\nWe have established widely used and recognized e-commerce brands through marketing and promotional campaigns, particularly strategic use of performance marketing spend, which can be variable based on travel demand, and which saw increased volatility during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have invested considerable resources in establishing and maintaining our brands, and intend to continue to invest resources in marketing and other brand building to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our brands.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe compete globally with both online and traditional travel and restaurant reservation and related services. The markets for the services we offer are intensely competitive, constantly evolving, and subject to rapid change, and current and new competitors can launch new services at a relatively low cost. Some of our current and potential competitors, such as Google, Apple, Alibaba, Tencent, Amazon, and Facebook, have significantly more customers or users, consumer data, and financial and other resources than we do, and may be able to leverage other aspects of their businesses (e.g., search or mobile device businesses) to enable them to compete more effectively with us. For example, Google has entered various aspects of the online travel market and has grown rapidly in this area, including by offering a flight meta-search product (\"Google Flights\"), a hotel meta-search product (\"Google Hotel Ads\"), its \"Book on Google\" reservation functionality, Google Travel, a planning tool that aggregates its flight, hotel, and packages products in one website, and by integrating its hotel meta-search products and restaurant information and reservation products into its Google Maps app.\n\nWe currently, or may in the future, compete with a variety of companies, including:\n\n- online travel or restaurant reservation services and meta-search services;\n- large online search, social networking, and marketplace companies;\n- travel service providers such as accommodation providers, rental car or car- or ride-sharing companies, and airlines, and other travel service providers, many of which have their own branded online platforms to which they drive business;\n- traditional travel agencies, travel management companies, wholesalers, and tour operators; and\n- companies offering technology services and software solutions to travel service providers.\n\nFor more information regarding current and potential competitors and the competitive nature of the markets in which we operate, please see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors \"Intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance.\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Government Regulation\n\nOur ability to provide our services and any future services is affected by legal regulations of national and local governments and regulatory authorities around the world, many of which are evolving and subject to new or revised interpretations. Examples of these laws and regulations, which vary and sometimes conflict, include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, the proposed Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act in the European Union, and local laws or regulations relating to corrupt payments to governmental officials or third parties, data privacy requirements, labor relations, nondiscrimination, human rights, anti-human trafficking, taxes, antitrust or competition laws, sanctioned countries or sanctioned persons, and consumer protection laws. Violations could result in fines, penalties, and/or criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, and/or prohibitions on how we conduct or propose to conduct our business. They could also result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our services in one or more countries, delay or prevent potential acquisitions, and materially damage our reputation, brands, global expansion efforts, ability to attract and retain employees and business partners, business, and operating results. Even if we comply with these laws and regulations, doing business in certain jurisdictions or violations of these laws and regulations by the accommodations, restaurants, travel service providers, or other parties with which we conduct business runs the risk of harming our reputation and our brands, which could adversely affect our results of operations or stock price. Regulations that impact our business or our industry include:\n\n- Data Protection and Privacy : Regulatory and legislative activity in the areas of privacy, data protection, and information and cyber security governing parts of our business continues to increase worldwide. We have established and continue to maintain policies and a global governance framework to comply with laws that apply to our business,",

      "answer": "In FY2022, Nike directly operated within APLA as part of its geographic operating segments, which included associated costs and foreign currency impacts such as non-recurring impairment charges due to the anticipated release of non-cash cumulative foreign currency translation losses from transitioning certain businesses to third-party distributors. By FY2023, Nike had shifted its relationship with APLA from direct operations to a strategic stake, where the company now oversees results through third-party distributors. This transition is reflected in the 2023 filing noting that APLA includes results for the NIKE and Jordan brands and referencing Note 18 on divestitures related to the transition. Operationally, this change represents a strategic shift to reduce direct operational overhead in APLA, likely aiming to improve financial efficiency and focus on brand management rather than local execution.",

Global Brand Divisions costs represent demand creation and operating overhead expense that include product creation and design expenses centrally managed for the NIKE Brand, as well as costs associated with NIKE Direct global digital operations and enterprise technology.\n\nCorporate consists primarily of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to the Company's headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020, Corporate included a non-recurring impairment charge, recognized as a result of the Company's decision to transition certain NIKE Brand businesses within APLA to a third-party distributor. This charge primarily reflected the anticipated release of associated non-cash cumulative foreign currency translation losses. For more information regarding this charge, refer to Note 20 - Acquisitions and Divestitures.\n\nThe primary financial measure used by the Company to evaluate performance of individual operating segments is earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), which represents Net income before Interest expense (income), net and Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nAs part of the Company's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in the Company's geographic operating segments and to Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons, and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and Cost of sales for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases in the entity's functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from the Company's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses.\n\nAccounts receivable, net, Inventories and Property, plant and equipment, net for operating segments are regularly reviewed by management and are therefore provided below.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 87",

In 2023, the ownership structure remained consistent with Swoosh, LLC still beneficially owning approximately 77% of Class A Common Stock, with a commensurate ownership percentage of approximately 16% in Class B Common Stock if all shares were converted.

We require the contractors that directly manufacture our products and our licensees that make products using our intellectual property (including, indirectly, their contract manufacturers) to comply with a code of conduct and other environmental, human rights, health and safety standards for the benefit of workers. We also require our contract manufacturers and the contractors of our licensees to comply with applicable standards for product safety. Notwithstanding their contractual obligations, from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may fail to enforce such standards or applicable local law on their contractors. If one or more of our direct or indirect contractors violates or fails to comply with, or is accused of violating or failing to comply with, such standards and laws, this could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. Negative publicity regarding production methods, alleged unethical or illegal practices or workplace or related conditions of any of our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our brand image and sales, force us to locate alternative suppliers, manufacturers or licenses or result in the imposition of additional regulations, including new or additional quotas, tariffs, sanctions, product safety regulations or other regulatory measures, by governmental authorities.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Securities, Investments and Liquidity\n\n## Our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns.\n\nFrom time to time, we may invest in technology, business infrastructure, new businesses or capabilities, product offering and manufacturing innovation and expansion of existing businesses, such as our NIKE Direct operations, which require substantial cash investments and management attention. We believe cost-effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability; however, significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in developing a new business or expanding an existing business. The failure of any significant investment to provide expected returns or profitability could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations. See also ' Our NIKE Direct operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties .'\n\n## The sale of a large number of shares of common stock by our principal stockholder could depress the market price of our common stock.\n\nAs of June 30, 2022, Swoosh, LLC beneficially owned approximately 77% of our Class A Common Stock. If, on June 30, 2022, all of these shares were converted into Class B Common Stock, the commensurate ownership percentage of our Class B Common Stock would be approximately 16%. The shares are available for resale, subject to the requirements of the U.S. securities laws and the terms of the limited liability company agreement governing Swoosh, LLC. The sale or prospect of a sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Swoosh, LLC was formed by Philip H. Knight, our Chairman Emeritus, to hold the majority of his shares of Class A Common Stock. Mr. Knight does not have voting rights with respect to Swoosh, LLC, although Travis Knight, his son and a NIKE director, has a significant role in the management of the Class A Common Stock owned by Swoosh, LLC.\n\n## Changes in our credit ratings or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquidity, increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options.\n\nOur long-term debt is currently rated Investment Grade by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's Investors Service. If our credit ratings are lowered, borrowing costs for our existing facilities or for future long-term debt or short-term credit facilities may increase and our financing options, including our access to credit or capital markets, could be adversely affected. We may also be subject to restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pledge assets as security, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates. Failure to comply with such covenants could result in a default, and as a result, the commitments of our lenders under our credit agreements may be terminated and the maturity of amounts owed may be accelerated. In addition, macroeconomic conditions, such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets, could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt.\n\n## If our internal controls are ineffective, our operating results could be adversely affected.\n\nOur internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 22",

      "answer": "In FY22, Nike operated directly in APLA, maintaining a significant presence through its NIKE Direct operations and wholesale distribution, with APLA contributing to the 14% growth in the NIKE Direct business. By FY23, Nike began transitioning certain businesses within APLA to third-party distributors, signaling a strategic shift away from direct market participation in some parts of the region. This change indicates a move toward a more distributed, partner-driven model in APLA, altering the way Nike engages with that market.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In FY22, Nike directly operated in APLA, with the region contributing to the 14% growth in the NIKE Direct business and remaining largely open during the fiscal year.",
        "Step 2: In FY23, Nike began transitioning certain NIKE Brand businesses in APLA to third-party distributors, as noted in the operating segments disclosure, indicating a structural shift in market participation.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a strategic evolution from a direct-to-consumer and wholesale model in APLA to a more selective, distributor-focused approach, likely aimed at optimizing operational efficiency and market reach."

          "chunk_text": "## ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nNIKE designs, develops, markets and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products through NIKE Direct operations, which is comprised of both NIKEowned retail stores and sales through our digital platforms (also referred to as \"NIKE Brand Digital\"), to retail accounts and to a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, 'must-have' products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences through digital platforms and at retail.\n\nThrough the Consumer Direct Acceleration, we are focusing on creating the marketplace of the future through more premium, consistent and seamless consumer experiences, leading with digital and our owned stores, as well as select wholesale partners that share our marketplace vision. Over the last several years, as we have executed against the Consumer Direct Acceleration, we have grown our NIKE Direct business to be approximately 42% of total NIKE Brand revenues for fiscal 2022, and we have reduced the number of wholesale accounts globally. Additionally, we have aligned our product creation and category organizations around a new consumer construct focused on Men's, Women's and Kids' and continue to invest in data and analytics, demand sensing, insight gathering, inventory management and other areas to create an end-to-end technology foundation, which we expect will further accelerate our digital transformation. We believe this unified approach will accelerate growth and unlock more efficiency for our business, while driving speed and responsiveness as we serve consumers globally.\n\nDuring fiscal 2021, we substantially completed a series of leadership and operating model changes to streamline and speed up the strategic execution of the Consumer Direct Acceleration. These changes resulted in a net reduction of our global workforce and during fiscal 2021, we incurred pre-tax charges of $294 million, which relate to employee termination costs and, to a lesser extent, stock-based compensation expense. For fiscal 2022, we recognized an immaterial amount of related employee termination costs and, to a lesser extent, stock-based compensation expense. We expect future annual wage-related savings will be reinvested to execute against this next phase of our strategy. For more information related to our organizational realignment and related costs, see Note 21 - Restructuring within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## COVID-19 AND MARKET DYNAMICS UPDATE\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on the global supply chain created volatility in our fiscal 2022 business results and operations globally. Despite these challenges, we achieved record Revenues for fiscal 2022, which increased 5% compared to the prior fiscal year with gross margin expansion of 120 basis points. Our NIKE Direct business continued its momentum, growing 14% and 15% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, respectively, led by North America, APLA and EMEA, partially offset by declines in Greater China due to a COVID-19 resurgence in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2022 as well as marketplace dynamics. During fiscal 2022, nearly all of our owned stores remained open across North America, EMEA and APLA. In Greater China however, due to a COVID-19 resurgence, we experienced a higher level of temporary store closures, with some operating on reduced hours, as well as lower physical traffic compared to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the majority of NIKE Brand and Converse contract manufacturers in Vietnam and Indonesia were subject to government mandated shutdowns due to COVID-19. As a result of these closures, we lost approximately three months of production, impacting available product supply throughout fiscal 2022. Globally, nearly all of our supplier base is currently operational without restrictions and with factory production exceeding pre-closure production levels. In addition, our supply of available inventory continued to be impacted in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 as extended inventory transit times drove elevated levels of in-transit inventory. These supply chain impacts and a COVID-19 resurgence in Greater China, combined with other factors, caused Inventories to grow to $8.4 billion, an increase of 23% compared to fiscal 2021.\n\nWe also experienced elevated transportation, logistics and fulfillment costs as a result of this dynamic environment, which partially offset gross margin expansion in fiscal 2022.\n\nInventory transit times as well as logistics and fulfillment costs are expected to remain elevated. We also expect product costs to remain elevated due to higher input costs. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect gross margin could be negatively impacted by increased promotional activity to sell seasonal product arriving late due to the combination of temporary factory closures at the beginning of fiscal 2022 and continued elevated transit times. To mitigate the impact across our business, our teams are continuing to leverage our operational playbook and taking actions where we can, including balancing inventory across our geographies, pricing actions and employing a seasonless approach to products. Despite these short-term dynamics, we believe our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy continues to drive our business towards our long-term financial goals.\n\nDuring fiscal 2022, we continued to invest in our digital transformation and brand campaigns as the world returned to sport, and we expect to maintain our multi-year investment plans in order to transform our business of the future.",

      "question": "How has General Motors' approach to EV manufacturing capacity evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of strategic focus and supply chain development?",
      "answer": "In 2023, General Motors emphasized significant investments in EV manufacturing capacity based on expectations for future EV demand, acknowledging the risks and uncertainties associated with such investments, including high fixed costs and limitations on closing facilities. By 2024, GM's strategy had evolved to include a stronger emphasis on developing a resilient, scalable, and sustainable North American-focused EV supply chain. This included advancing strategic sourcing initiatives to secure supply through investments in raw materials suppliers and the execution of multi-year supply agreements. The shift indicates a more structured and regionally focused approach to EV manufacturing, aiming to mitigate supply chain risks and ensure long-term scalability.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 - In 2023, GM highlighted significant investments in EV manufacturing capacity, based on expectations for future EV demand, while acknowledging risks and uncertainties.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nIn addition, the production and sale of EV s at increasingly larger volumes is also part of our long-term strategy to comply with global emissions and fuel economy regulations. If we are not able to successfully execute our EV  strategy or if future compliance requirements do not change, we may need to take various actions, including purchasing additional regulatory credits from third parties, paying penalties to various government regulators, or taking portfolio actions such as reducing the production of profitable ICE vehicles, the impact of which could be material to our results of operations and financial condition. See \"Our operations and products are subject to extensive laws, regulations and policies, including those related to vehicle emissions and fuel economy standards, which can significantly increase our costs and affect how we do business.\"\n\nOur near-term profitability is dependent upon the success of our current line of ICE vehicles, particularly our full-size ICE SUVs and full-size ICE pickup trucks. While we offer a broad portfolio of cars, crossovers, SUV s and trucks, and we have announced significant plans to design, build and sell a strategic portfolio of EVs, we currently recognize the highest profit margins on our full-size ICE SUV s and full-size ICE pickup trucks. As a result, our near-term success is dependent upon our ability to sell higher margin vehicles in sufficient volumes. We are also using the cash generated by our ICE vehicles to fund our growth strategy, including with respect to EV s and AV s. Any near-term shift in consumer preferences toward smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, whether as a result of increases in the price of oil or any sustained shortage of oil, including as a result of global political instability (such as related to the ongoing conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East), concerns about fuel consumption or  GHG emissions, or other reasons, could weaken the demand for our higher margin vehicles.  More stringent fuel economy regulations could also impact our ability to sell these vehicles or could result in additional costs associated with these vehicles, which could be material. See 'Our operations and products are subject to extensive laws, regulations and policies, including those related to vehicle emissions and fuel economy standards, which can significantly increase our costs and affect how we do business.'\n\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry that has historically had excess manufacturing capacity, and attempts by our competitors to sell more vehicles could have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing, market share and operating results. The global automotive industry is highly competitive in terms of the quality, innovation, new technologies, pricing, fuel economy, reliability, safety, customer service and financial services offered. Additionally, despite the fact that OEMs have experienced supply constraints in recent years due to the COVID-19 pandemic and certain supply chain and logistics challenges, overall manufacturing capacity in the automotive industry has historically far exceeded demand. Supply chain and logistics challenges may occur as a result of geopolitical and/or policy actions. In addition, we have made, and plan to continue to make, significant investments in EV  manufacturing capacity based on our expectations for long-term EV demand, which is subject to various risks and uncertainties as described above. Our transition to EV s will also require developing a more resilient, scalable and sustainable  North American-focused EV  supply chain, which includes advancing our strategic sourcing initiatives to secure supply through investments in raw materials suppliers and the execution of strategic, multi-year supply agreements with suppliers throughout the value chain. These EV -related agreements may require us to hold higher than normal levels of EV  raw materials inventory and to make long-term commitments to purchase raw materials. Expected demand for these raw materials currently exceeds the North American capacity of the existing supply chain. If we are not successful in developing our North America supply chain, our operating results and profitability could be negatively impacted.\n\nMany manufacturers, including GM, have relatively high fixed labor costs as well as limitations on their ability to efficiently close facilities and reduce fix ed costs, including as a result of collective bargaining agreements. In light of any ex cess capacity and high fix ed costs, many industry participants have attempted to sell more vehicles by providing subsidized financing or leasing programs, offering marketing incentives or reducing vehicle prices. As a result, we have had, and may in the future need, to offer similar incentives, which may result in vehicle prices that do not offset our costs, including any cost increases or the impact of adverse currency fluctuations, which could affect our profitability. Our competitors may also seek to benefit from economies of scale by consolidating or entering into other strategic agreements such as alliances or joint ventures intended to enhance their competitiveness.\n\nManufacturers in countries that have lower production costs, such as China and India, have become competitors in key emerging markets and have begun offering their products in established markets, as well as a low-cost alternative to established entry-level automobiles. These actions have had, and are expected to continue to have,  a  significant  negative  effect  on  our  vehicle  pricing,  market  share  and  operating  results  in  these  markets.  In  addition,  foreign  governments  may  decide  to implement tax and other policies that favor their domestic manufacturers at the expense of international manufacturers, including GM and its joint venture partners. Similarly, the potential imposition of tariffs may lead to further challenges for G M and its joint venture partners.\n\nWe recently announced plans to refocus our AV strategy on personal vehicles and the execution of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to successfully mitigate unique technological, operational and regulatory risks.

By 2024, GM's involvement evolved into a more direct investment of $0.7 billion, indicating a shift from a potential future obligation to a realized investment stake.
