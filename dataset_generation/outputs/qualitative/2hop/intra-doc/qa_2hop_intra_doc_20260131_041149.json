      "answer": "The company received a total payment of $526 million from the settlement of forward interest rate swap contracts: $247 million from the 2023 Notes, $143 million from the March 2022 Notes, and $136 million from the September 2022 Notes.

      "answer": "The Benefit Restoration Plan supplements benefits provided under the defined contribution retirement plan (401(k) Plan) for participants whose benefits are restricted due to provisions in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Company Match under the 401(k) Plan varies up to a maximum of 4.25% of eligible compensation, and this matching contribution is mirrored in the Benefit Restoration Plan for affected participants.",

        "Step 4: Synthesize - The Benefit Restoration Plan directly ties to the 401(k) Plan by replicating the Company Match (up to 4.25%) for participants restricted under tax code provisions, ensuring they receive equivalent benefits."

The Company's share-based payment expense per share is equal to 15% of the closing price on the date of purchase.  The ESPP is considered a liability award and is measured at fair value at each reporting date, and the sharebased payment expense is recognized over the six-month offering period. Under the ESPP, the Company issued 0.6 million shares of common stock in 2024, and 0.7 million shares of common stock in 2023 and 2022, and recognized share-based payment expense of $22 million, $21 million, and $20 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n\n## NOTE 11: Employee Retirement Plans\n\nThe Company maintains a defined contribution retirement plan for eligible employees (the 401(k) Plan).  Eligible employees may participate in the 401(k) Plan the first of the month after thirty days of employment.  The Company makes contributions to the 401(k) Plan each payroll period, based upon a matching formula applied to employee deferrals (the Company Match).  Participants are eligible to receive the Company Match pursuant to the terms of the 401(k) Plan.  The Company Match varies based on how much the employee elects to defer up to a maximum of 4.25% of eligible compensation.  The Company Match is invested identically to employee contributions and is immediately vested.\n\nThe Company maintains a Benefit Restoration Plan to supplement benefits provided under the 401(k) Plan to participants whose benefits are restricted as a result of certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  This plan provides for employee salary deferrals and employer contributions in the form of a Company Match.\n\nThe Company maintains a non-qualified deferred compensation program called the Lowe's Cash Deferral Plan.  This plan is designed to permit certain employees to defer receipt of portions of their compensation, thereby delaying taxation on the deferral amount and on subsequent earnings until the balance is distributed.  This plan does not provide for Company contributions.\n\nThe Company recognized expense associated with these employee retirement plans of $172 million, $167 million, and $174 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n\n## NOTE 12: Income Taxes\n\nThe following is a reconciliation of the federal statutory tax  rate to the effective tax  rate:\n\n",

      "question": "Given GM's dependency on full-size ICE pickup trucks for near-term profitability and the risks outlined in the forward-looking statements, how does the company's reliance on these vehicles interact with its strategic shift toward electric vehicles (EVs) to impact long-term financial stability?",
      "answer": "GM's near-term profitability is heavily dependent on the success of its full-size ICE pickup trucks, which currently generate the highest profit margins and fund the company's strategic shift toward EVs. However, the forward-looking statements highlight that any shift in consumer preferences toward smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles could weaken demand for these high-margin ICE vehicles. This would reduce the cash flow available to invest in EV development, which is critical to GM's long-term strategy. Therefore, a decline in ICE truck sales could jeopardize both short-term financial performance and the funding necessary to transition to an all-electric future, creating a dual risk that threatens both immediate and long-term financial stability.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - GM's near-term profitability is dependent on full-size ICE pickup trucks, which yield the highest profit margins and fund EV development.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - If consumer demand for full-size ICE pickup trucks declines, GM's short-term profitability would be negatively impacted, reducing the financial resources available to fund its long-term EV strategy. This interplay between current profitability and future strategic investment creates a critical financial vulnerability."

At year-end, the fair value of these derivatives was $557 million in assets and $180 million in liabilities.

Patents generally hav e a term of twenty years from the date they are filed. As our patent portfolio has been built ov er time, the remaining terms of indiv idual patents across our patent portfolio v ary. Although our patents hav e v alue, no single patent is essential to our business. We continuously assess our merchandising departments and product lines for opportunities to expand the assortment of products offered within The Home Depot's portfolio of proprietary and exclusiv e brands.\n\n## COMPETITION AND SEASONALITY\n\nOur industry is highly competitiv e, highly fragmented, and ev olv ing. As a result, we face competition for customers for our products and serv ices from a variety of retailers, suppliers, serv ice prov iders, and distributors and manufacturers that sell products directly to their respectiv e customer bases. These competitors range from traditional brick-and-mortar, to multichannel, to exclusiv ely online, and they include a number of other home improv ement retailers; local, regional and national hardware stores; electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses; and lumber yards. With respect to some products and serv ices, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, paint stores, specialty and mass digital retailers, warehouse clubs, MRO distributors, national and local wholesale supply distributors, home d\u00e9cor retailers, and other retailers, as well as with prov iders of home improv ement serv ices and tool and equipment rental. The internet facilitates competitiv e entry, price transparency, and comparison shopping, increasing the lev el of competition we face.\n\nBoth in-store and online, we compete primarily based on customer experience; price; quality; product av ailability, assortment, and innov ation; and deliv ery options and capabilities. We also compete based on store and branch location and appearance, presentation of merchandise, and ease of shopping experience throughout ev ery step of the project, from inspiration and research to any post-purchase support. Our Pros also look for dedicated sales support, competitiv e credit and pricing options, project planning tools, and product depth and job-lot quantities, particularly for their complex purchase needs. Furthermore, with respect to deliv ery options, customers are seeking faster and/or guaranteed deliv ery times, low-price or free shipping, and/or conv enient pickup options. Our ability to be competitiv e on deliv ery and pickup times, options and costs depends on many factors, including the success of our supply chain inv estments, described more fully under 'Our Supply Chain' below, and our interconnected retail strategy.\n\nOur business is subject to seasonal influences. Generally, our highest v olume of sales occurs in our second fiscal quarter, as we mov e into the spring season in the regions in which we operate.\n\n## INTERCONNECTED SHOPPING EXPERIENCE\n\nWe continue to enhance our capabilities to prov ide our customers with a frictionless interconnected shopping experience across our stores, branches, online, on the job site, and in their homes, focusing on continued inv estments in our websites and mobile apps to enhance the customer experience.\n\n## Digital Experience\n\nEnhancements to our digital platforms are critical for our increasingly interconnected customers, who often research products and check av ailable inv entory online before going into one of our stores to v iew products in person or talk to an associate and then making their purchase either in store or online. While in the store, customers may also go online to access ratings and rev iews, compare prices, v iew our extended assortment, and purchase additional products. Our inv estments in a truly interconnected experience are focused on bringing together the power of our physical presence and the frictionless interaction of our digital capabilities.\n\nA significant majority of the traffic in Home Depot's digital channels is on mobile dev ices. Mobile users expect more simplicity and relev ancy in their digital interactions. In addition to supporting our DIY and DIFM customers on their shopping journeys, mobile dev ices can also help serv e the needs of Pros working on complex projects. As a result, we hav e made inv estments in our digital platforms to improv e the ov erall presentation and ease of navigation for the user. We hav e also enhanced the 'shopability' of an online product by including more information on the product's landing page, including related products and/or parts of a collection, as well as v arious fulfillment options. We believ e our focus on improv ing search capabilities, site functionality, category presentation, product content such as customer product rev iew summaries, speed to checkout, and fulfillment options has yielded higher traffic, better conv ersion and continued sales growth. As our customers expect a more personalized experience, our ability to collect, use, retain, and protect relev ant customer data is important for our ability to effectiv ely meet their expectations.",

Furthermore, with respect to deliv ery options, customers are seeking faster and/or guaranteed deliv ery times, low-price or free shipping, and/or convenient pickup options. Our ability to be competitiv e on deliv ery and pickup times, options and costs depends on many factors, including lev eraging the momentum of our inv estments in our supply chain and our interconnected retail capabilities to further enhance the customer shopping experience. Failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitiv e deliv ery and pickup options could negativ ely impact the demand for our products and serv ices and our profit margins.\n\nWe use our marketing, adv ertising and promotional programs to driv e customer traffic and compete more effectiv ely, and we must regularly assess and adjust our efforts to address changes in the competitiv e landscape. Intense competitiv e pressures from one or more of our competitors, such as through aggressiv e promotional pricing or liquidation ev ents, or our inability to adapt effectiv ely and quickly to a changing competitiv e landscape, could adv ersely affect our prices, our margins, or demand for our products and serv ices. If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitiv e pressures, including through the deliv ery of a superior interconnected customer experience or through maintenance of effectiv e sales and marketing, advertising or promotional programs lev eraging both our digital and physical platforms, our market share and our financial performance could be adv ersely affected. If we experience inflation or deflation at a lev el beyond our ability to respond effectiv ely, we may not be able to adjust prices to sufficiently offset the effects without negativ ely impacting demand or margins, as applicable, or it may adv ersely affect our ability to compete based on price.\n\nWe may not timely identify or effectively respond to customer needs, expectations or trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services, and our market share.\n\nThe success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to ev olv ing trends in demographics; shifts in customer preferences, expectations and needs; changes in the macroeconomic or political env ironment; and unexpected weather conditions, natural disasters, or public health issues (including pandemics and related impacts) that impact our customers, while also managing appropriate inv entory lev els in our stores, branches and distribution or fulfillment centers and maintaining an excellent customer experience. It is difficult to successfully predict the products and serv ices our customers will demand. As our customers expect a more personalized experience, our ability to collect, use, retain, and protect relev ant customer data is important for effectiv ely meeting their expectations. Our ability to collect and use that data, howev er, is subject to a number of external factors, including the impact of legislation or regulations gov erning data priv acy, data-driv en technologies such as artificial intelligence, and data security, as well as customer expectations around data collection, retention, and use. In addition, each of our primary customer groups has different needs and expectations, many of which ev olv e as the demographics in a particular customer group change. Customer preferences and expectations related to sustainability of products and operations are also changing. If we do not successfully differentiate the shopping experience to attract our customers and meet their indiv idual needs and expectations, it may adv ersely impact our sales or our market share.\n\nCustomer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receiv e products or serv ices are also becoming more demanding. Customers routinely and increasingly use technology and a v ariety of electronic dev ices and digital platforms to rapidly compare products and prices, read product rev iews, determine real-time product av ailability, and purchase products, and new channels and tools to enhance the customer experience appear and change rapidly. Our Pros also look for additional capabilities, including dedicated sales support, competitiv e credit and pricing options, project planning tools, and product depth and job lot quantities, particularly for their complex purchase needs. Once products are purchased, customers seek alternate options for deliv ery of those products, including adv ance ordering through digital platforms for Pros, and they often expect quick, timely, and low-price or free deliv ery and/or conv enient pickup or deliv ery options. We must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the shopping and purchasing process by continuing to adjust and enhance the online and in-store customer experience as well as our deliv ery options.

This strategy directly supports its ability to maintain product depth and job-lot quantities, which are crucial for serving professional customers.

        "Step 3: Synthesize - The repeated emphasis across both chunks on 'competitive credit and pricing options' in conjunction with 'product depth and job-lot quantities' indicates a strategic alignment to serve Pros. Offering favorable financial terms enables Pros to make larger purchases, which in turn necessitates and justifies maintaining deeper inventory and bulk availability."

Patents generally hav e a term of twenty years from the date they are filed. As our patent portfolio has been built ov er time, the remaining terms of indiv idual patents across our patent portfolio v ary. Although our patents hav e v alue, no single patent is essential to our business. We continuously assess our merchandising departments and product lines for opportunities to expand the assortment of products offered within The Home Depot's portfolio of proprietary and exclusiv e brands.\n\n## COMPETITION AND SEASONALITY\n\nOur industry is highly competitiv e, highly fragmented, and ev olv ing. As a result, we face competition for customers for our products and serv ices from a variety of retailers, suppliers, serv ice prov iders, and distributors and manufacturers that sell products directly to their respectiv e customer bases. These competitors range from traditional brick-and-mortar, to multichannel, to exclusiv ely online, and they include a number of other home improv ement retailers; local, regional and national hardware stores; electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses; and lumber yards. With respect to some products and serv ices, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, paint stores, specialty and mass digital retailers, warehouse clubs, MRO distributors, national and local wholesale supply distributors, home d\u00e9cor retailers, and other retailers, as well as with prov iders of home improv ement serv ices and tool and equipment rental. The internet facilitates competitiv e entry, price transparency, and comparison shopping, increasing the lev el of competition we face.\n\nBoth in-store and online, we compete primarily based on customer experience; price; quality; product av ailability, assortment, and innov ation; and deliv ery options and capabilities. We also compete based on store and branch location and appearance, presentation of merchandise, and ease of shopping experience throughout ev ery step of the project, from inspiration and research to any post-purchase support. Our Pros also look for dedicated sales support, competitiv e credit and pricing options, project planning tools, and product depth and job-lot quantities, particularly for their complex purchase needs. Furthermore, with respect to deliv ery options, customers are seeking faster and/or guaranteed deliv ery times, low-price or free shipping, and/or conv enient pickup options. Our ability to be competitiv e on deliv ery and pickup times, options and costs depends on many factors, including the success of our supply chain inv estments, described more fully under 'Our Supply Chain' below, and our interconnected retail strategy.\n\nOur business is subject to seasonal influences. Generally, our highest v olume of sales occurs in our second fiscal quarter, as we mov e into the spring season in the regions in which we operate.\n\n## INTERCONNECTED SHOPPING EXPERIENCE\n\nWe continue to enhance our capabilities to prov ide our customers with a frictionless interconnected shopping experience across our stores, branches, online, on the job site, and in their homes, focusing on continued inv estments in our websites and mobile apps to enhance the customer experience.\n\n## Digital Experience\n\nEnhancements to our digital platforms are critical for our increasingly interconnected customers, who often research products and check av ailable inv entory online before going into one of our stores to v iew products in person or talk to an associate and then making their purchase either in store or online. While in the store, customers may also go online to access ratings and rev iews, compare prices, v iew our extended assortment, and purchase additional products. Our inv estments in a truly interconnected experience are focused on bringing together the power of our physical presence and the frictionless interaction of our digital capabilities.\n\nA significant majority of the traffic in Home Depot's digital channels is on mobile dev ices. Mobile users expect more simplicity and relev ancy in their digital interactions. In addition to supporting our DIY and DIFM customers on their shopping journeys, mobile dev ices can also help serv e the needs of Pros working on complex projects. As a result, we hav e made inv estments in our digital platforms to improv e the ov erall presentation and ease of navigation for the user. We hav e also enhanced the 'shopability' of an online product by including more information on the product's landing page, including related products and/or parts of a collection, as well as v arious fulfillment options. We believ e our focus on improv ing search capabilities, site functionality, category presentation, product content such as customer product rev iew summaries, speed to checkout, and fulfillment options has yielded higher traffic, better conv ersion and continued sales growth. As our customers expect a more personalized experience, our ability to collect, use, retain, and protect relev ant customer data is important for our ability to effectiv ely meet their expectations.",

Our Pros also look for dedicated sales support, competitiv e credit and pricing options, project planning tools, product depth and job lot quantities, particularly for their complex purchase needs. Furthermore, with respect to deliv ery options, customers are seeking faster and/or guaranteed deliv ery times, low-price or free shipping, and/or convenient pickup options. Our ability to be competitiv e on deliv ery and pickup times, options and costs depends on many factors, including lev eraging the momentum of our inv estments in our supply chain and our interconnected retail capabilities to further enhance the customer shopping experience. Failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitiv e deliv ery and pickup options could negativ ely impact the demand for our products and serv ices and our profit margins.\n\nWe use our marketing, adv ertising and promotional programs to driv e customer traffic and compete more effectiv ely, and we must regularly assess and adjust our efforts to address changes in the competitiv e landscape. Intense competitiv e pressures from one or more of our competitors, such as through aggressiv e promotional pricing or liquidation ev ents, or our inability to adapt effectiv ely and quickly to a changing competitiv e landscape, could adv ersely affect our prices, our margins, or demand for our products and serv ices. If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitiv e pressures, including through the deliv ery of a superior interconnected customer experience or through maintenance of effectiv e sales and marketing, advertising or promotional programs lev eraging both our digital and physical platforms, our market share and our financial performance could be adv ersely affected. If we experience inflation or deflation at a lev el beyond our ability to respond effectiv ely, we may not be able to adjust prices to sufficiently offset the effects without negativ ely impacting demand or margins, as applicable, or it may adv ersely affect our ability to compete based on price.\n\nWe may not timely identify or effectively respond to customer needs, expectations or trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services, and our market share.\n\nThe success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to ev olv ing trends in demographics; shifts in customer preferences, expectations and needs; changes in the macroeconomic or political env ironment; and unexpected weather conditions, natural disasters, or public health issues (including pandemics and related impacts) that impact our customers, while also managing appropriate inv entory lev els in our stores, branches and distribution or fulfillment centers and maintaining an excellent customer experience. It is difficult to successfully predict the products and serv ices our customers will demand. As our customers expect a more personalized experience, our ability to collect, use, retain, and protect relev ant customer data is important for effectiv ely meeting their expectations. Our ability to collect and use that data, howev er, is subject to a number of external factors, including the impact of legislation or regulations gov erning data priv acy, data-driv en technologies such as artificial intelligence, and data security, as well as customer expectations around data collection, retention, and use. In addition, each of our primary customer groups has different needs and expectations, many of which ev olv e as the demographics in a particular customer group change. Customer preferences and expectations related to sustainability of products and operations are also changing. If we do not successfully differentiate the shopping experience to attract our customers and meet their indiv idual needs and expectations, it may adv ersely impact our sales or our market share.\n\nCustomer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receiv e products or serv ices are also becoming more demanding. Customers routinely and increasingly use technology and a v ariety of electronic dev ices and digital platforms to rapidly compare products and prices, read product rev iews, determine real-time product av ailability, and purchase products, and new channels and tools to enhance the customer experience appear and change rapidly. Our Pros also look for additional capabilities, including dedicated sales support, competitiv e credit and pricing options, project planning tools, and product depth and job lot quantities, particularly for their complex purchase needs. Once products are purchased, customers seek alternate options for deliv ery of those products, including adv ance ordering through digital platforms for Pros, and they often expect quick, timely, and low-price or free deliv ery and/or conv enient pickup or deliv ery options. We must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the shopping and purchasing process by continuing to adjust and enhance the online and in-store customer experience as well as our deliv ery options.

As part of enhancing the interconnected shopping experience, we continue to inv est in our supply chain network, with the goal of achiev ing the fastest, most efficient and most reliable deliv ery capabilities in home improv ement. Our efforts are focused on ensuring product av ailability and increasing the speed and reliability of deliv ery for our customers while managing our costs. Our supply chain inv estments hav e helped us to operate effectiv ely and meet our customers' needs, ev en with the challenging economic env ironment ov er the past few years.\n\nWe centrally forecast and replenish the v ast majority of our Home Depot store products through sophisticated inv entory management systems and utilize our network of distribution centers to serv e both our stores' and customers' needs. Our supply chain includes multiple distribution center platforms in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico tailored to meet the needs of our stores and customers based on types of products, location, transportation, and deliv ery requirements. These include rapid deployment centers, stocking distribution centers, bulk distribution centers, flatbed distribution centers, and direct fulfillment centers, among others. Ov er the past sev eral years, we hav e inv ested to further automate and mechanize our rapid deployment center network to driv e greater efficiency and faster mov ement of product.\n\nWe are also continuing to enhance our supply chain network with our expanded fulfillment facilities designed to driv e speed and reliability of deliv ery for our customers. In many markets, we offer same day or next day deliv ery of a multitude of products through our stores and fulfillment centers. We also have omni-channel fulfillment centers that deliv er product directly to customers, and market deliv ery operations that function as local hubs to consolidate freight for dispatch to customers for the final mile of deliv ery, with a focus on appliances. We hav e inv ested in our capabilities to control more of our appliance deliv ery end-to-end, manage all of our appliance deliv ery v olume through our market deliv ery operations, and expand our last mile deliv ery capacity. We have also opened additional flatbed distribution centers that handle large items like lumber and building materials that are transported on flatbed trucks. Our network is designed to create a competitiv e adv antage with unique, industry-leading capabilities for home improv ement needs for both our Pros and consumers. We will continue to inv est in our supply chain network as needed to support our business.\n\nIn addition to our distribution and fulfillment centers, we lev erage our stores as a network of conv enient customer pickup, return, and deliv ery fulfillment locations. We believ e our premium real estate footprint prov ides a distinct structural and competitiv e adv antage. For customers who shop online and want to pick up or return merchandise at a store, or hav e product deliv ered from a store, we hav e four interconnected retail programs: BOSS, BOPIS, BODFS, and BORIS. We also provide curbside pickup to complement our BOPIS offerings, in addition to the self-serv ice lockers at the front entrance of many of our stores. We also offer car and v an deliv ery serv ice from the majority of our U.S. stores. For fiscal 2024, approximately 50% of our U.S. online orders were fulfilled through a store. SRS branch locations throughout the U.S. also enable deliv eries direct to customer job sites on their preferred timelines. We continue to focus on dev eloping new capabilities to improv e both efficiency and customer experience for deliv ery from our stores and branches. Our strategic intent is to hav e a portfolio of efficient, timely and reliable sources and methods of deliv ery to choose from, optimizing order fulfillment and deliv ery based on customer needs, inv entory locations, and av ailable transportation options.\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY AND HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\nWe view sustainability and human capital management matters through the lens of our business, with an understanding that if we support our associates, our customers, our suppliers, and the communities we serv e, we also support our business and create v alue for our shareholders. Our sustainability and human capital management priorities build on the culture and v alues on which Home Depot was founded, and our initiativ es are embedded in our business strategy and activ ities. We organize our efforts around three pillars: (1) Focus on Our People, (2) Operate Sustainably, and (3) Strengthen Our Communities. Highlights of each of these pillars are set forth below. For further information on our three pillars, including related goals, see our 2024 Env ironmental, Social and Gov ernance Report (the '2024 ESG Report'), av ailable on our inv estor relations website at https://ir.homedepot.com/sustainability.",

We also acquired SRS to accelerate our growth with Pros. We continue to focus on driv ing productiv ity throughout the business by lowering our product and transportation costs, and in fiscal 2024 we executed a plan to reduce our fixed cost structure by approximately $500 million. The combination of reinv esting in our business to driv e higher sales and driv ing productiv ity to lower costs allows us to improv e our customer experience, increase our competitiv eness in the market, and deliv er shareholder v alue.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, we returned $8.9 billion to shareholders in the form of cash div idends. We also returned $0.6 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases prior to pausing share repurchases in March 2024 in anticipation of the SRS acquisition. Our capital allocation is discussed further in Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\n## OUR CUSTOMERS\n\nWe serve two primary customer groups - consumers (including both DIY and DIFM customers) and Pros - and hav e dev eloped v arying approaches to meet their div erse needs:\n\n## DIY Customers\n\nThese customers are typically homeowners who purchase products and complete their own projects and installations. Our associates assist these customers both in our stores and through online resources and other media designed to prov ide product and project knowledge. We also offer a v ariety of clinics and workshops to share this knowledge and to build an emotional connection with our DIY customers. As the preferences and behav iors of our DIY customers are changing, we are inv esting in capabilities to better meet the ev olv ing expectations of these customers.\n\n## Professional Customers (or 'Pros')\n\nThese customers are primarily professional renov ators/remodelers, general contractors, small to medium homebuilders, maintenance professionals, handymen, property managers, building serv ice contractors and specialty tradespeople, such as electricians, landscapers, plumbers, painters, pool contractors, and roofers. These customers build, renov ate, remodel, repair, and maintain residential properties, multifamily properties, hospitality properties, and commercial facilities, including education, healthcare, gov ernment, institutional, and office buildings.\n\nWe have a number of initiativ es designed to driv e growth with Pros, including those working on both simple and complex projects. In fiscal 2024, we acquired SRS, which sells products to specialty trade roofers, landscapers, and pool contractors. We remain focused on prov iding a customized online experience, a dedicated sales force, a broad assortment of Pro-focused products and brands, an extensiv e deliv ery network, our Pro X tra loyalty program, and enhanced credit offerings. Building on our historical strength as a destination for urgent purchase needs, we are inv esting in differentiated capabilities that will help us better serv e our Pros' complex purchase needs, including differentiated fulfillment options, additional trade credit offerings including our Pro House Account program, more showroom space, and an enhanced order management system. We also prov ide MRO products and related v alue-added serv ices to multifamily, hospitality, healthcare, and gov ernment housing facilities, among others, primarily through our subsidiary HD Supply.\n\n## DIFM Customers\n\nIntersecting our DIY customers and our Pros are our DIFM customers. These customers are typically homeowners who use Pros to complete their projects or installations. Currently, we offer installation serv ices in a v ariety of categories, such as flooring, water heaters, bath, garage doors, cabinets, cabinet makeovers, countertops, sheds, furnaces and central air systems, and windows. DIFM customers can purchase these serv ices in our stores, online, or in their homes through in-home consultations. In addition to serv ing our DIFM customer needs, we believ e our focus on the Pros who perform serv ices for these customers helps us driv e higher product sales.",

If these companies become unable to prov ide these serv ices to us, or if their systems are compromised or do not operate as intended, it could disrupt our business. The payment methods that we offer, and the selling channels in which we operate, also subject us to fraud and theft by threat actors, who are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, including by using means such as artificial intelligence, seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in our sales, payments, and payment processing systems. If we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept, or if payment-related data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data, we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments may be impaired.\n\nTrade credit offerings are an important part of serv ing Pros, including SRS customers, and we anticipate expanding our Pro House Account trade credit program as we further dev elop our capabilities. If we fail to offer attractiv e terms or serv ices, or employ underwriting criteria that are not competitiv e, our ability to grow our sales to these Pros may be adv ersely impacted. If our Pros are unable to make their payments, we may experience an increase in our losses. In addition, our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, or may expect or demand payment methods that we do not currently offer, which could result in competitiv e disadv antages or require a shift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs or present other risks. As a result, our business and operating results could be adv ersely affected.\n\nOur business is subject to seasonal influences, and uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions, climate change, natural disasters, as well as other catastrophic or uncharacteristic events, could impact our operations and financial results.\n\nNatural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, fires, floods, droughts or water scarcity, tornadoes, and earthquakes; unseasonable, unexpected or extreme weather conditions; acts of terrorism or v iolence, including activ e shooter situations; public health concerns, such as pandemics and quarantines and related impacts; civ il unrest; geopolitical or military conflicts or acts of war, as well as any related sanctions or other gov ernment or priv ate responses; or similar disruptions and catastrophic ev ents could hav e and on occasion hav e had an adv erse effect on our operations and financial performance in a number of ways. These types of ev ents can affect consumer spending and confidence and consumers' disposable income, particularly with respect to home improv ement or construction projects. They can also adv ersely affect our work force and prev ent associates and customers from reaching our stores, branches and other facilities. They can, temporarily or on a long-term basis, disrupt or disable operations of stores, branches, other facilities and support centers, and portions of our supply chain and distribution network, including causing reductions in the av ailability of inv entory and disruption of utility serv ices. In addition, these ev ents may affect our information systems and digital platforms, resulting in disruption to v arious aspects of our operations, including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders; to communicate with our stores, branches, other facilities or support centers or senior management; or to access financial or banking systems. Unseasonable, unexpected or extreme weather conditions such as excessiv e precipitation, warm temperatures during the winter season, or prolonged or extreme periods of warm or cold temperatures could render a portion of our inv entory incompatible with customer needs and adv ersely impact our financial results.\n\nFurthermore, the potential long-term impacts of climate change, whether inv olv ing physical risks (such as extreme weather conditions) or transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes), could be widespread and unpredictable. These changes ov er time could affect, for example, the av ailability and cost of or demand for certain products, commodities, and energy (including utilities), which in turn may impact our ability to procure certain goods or serv ices for the operation of our business at the quantities and lev els we consider optimal.\n\nAs a consequence of these or other catastrophic or uncharacteristic ev ents, we may experience interruption to our operations, increased costs, changes in customer behav ior or demand, or losses of property, equipment or inv entory, which would adv ersely affect our sales and profitability.\n\nIf we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, or if our suppliers experience financial difficulties  or other challenges, our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected.\n\nWe buy our products from suppliers located around the world, who in turn procure materials from across the globe. Our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our standards for quality and responsible sourcing, as well as our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner, is a significant challenge. Our ability to access products from our suppliers can be, and on occasion has been, adversely affected by economic or political instability; civ il unrest; geopolitical or military conflicts or acts of war, as well as any related sanctions or other gov ernment or priv ate responses; acts of terrorism or v iolence; public health issues",

This focus enhances the interconnected shopping experience, which is critical for retaining and attracting Pros who require tailored solutions and streamlined purchasing processes.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, The Home Depot is described as competing for Pros by offering 'dedicated sales support, competitive credit and pricing options, project planning tools, and product depth and job-lot quantities, particularly for their complex purchase needs.' This shows that project planning tools are a key component of their competitive strategy for Pros.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, it is reiterated that Pros require 'additional capabilities, including dedicated sales support, competitive credit and pricing options, project planning tools, and product depth and job lot quantities.' This confirms the continued importance of these tools in meeting Pro customer expectations.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The repeated emphasis on project planning tools in both sections indicates that The Home Depot views these tools as essential to meeting the complex demands of Pros, thereby reinforcing its competitive advantage in serving this customer segment."

Patents generally hav e a term of twenty years from the date they are filed. As our patent portfolio has been built ov er time, the remaining terms of indiv idual patents across our patent portfolio v ary. Although our patents hav e v alue, no single patent is essential to our business. We continuously assess our merchandising departments and product lines for opportunities to expand the assortment of products offered within The Home Depot's portfolio of proprietary and exclusiv e brands.\n\n## COMPETITION AND SEASONALITY\n\nOur industry is highly competitiv e, highly fragmented, and ev olv ing. As a result, we face competition for customers for our products and serv ices from a variety of retailers, suppliers, serv ice prov iders, and distributors and manufacturers that sell products directly to their respectiv e customer bases. These competitors range from traditional brick-and-mortar, to multichannel, to exclusiv ely online, and they include a number of other home improv ement retailers; local, regional and national hardware stores; electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses; and lumber yards. With respect to some products and serv ices, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, paint stores, specialty and mass digital retailers, warehouse clubs, MRO distributors, national and local wholesale supply distributors, home d\u00e9cor retailers, and other retailers, as well as with prov iders of home improv ement serv ices and tool and equipment rental. The internet facilitates competitiv e entry, price transparency, and comparison shopping, increasing the lev el of competition we face.\n\nBoth in-store and online, we compete primarily based on customer experience; price; quality; product av ailability, assortment, and innov ation; and deliv ery options and capabilities. We also compete based on store and branch location and appearance, presentation of merchandise, and ease of shopping experience throughout ev ery step of the project, from inspiration and research to any post-purchase support. Our Pros also look for dedicated sales support, competitiv e credit and pricing options, project planning tools, and product depth and job-lot quantities, particularly for their complex purchase needs. Furthermore, with respect to deliv ery options, customers are seeking faster and/or guaranteed deliv ery times, low-price or free shipping, and/or conv enient pickup options. Our ability to be competitiv e on deliv ery and pickup times, options and costs depends on many factors, including the success of our supply chain inv estments, described more fully under 'Our Supply Chain' below, and our interconnected retail strategy.\n\nOur business is subject to seasonal influences. Generally, our highest v olume of sales occurs in our second fiscal quarter, as we mov e into the spring season in the regions in which we operate.\n\n## INTERCONNECTED SHOPPING EXPERIENCE\n\nWe continue to enhance our capabilities to prov ide our customers with a frictionless interconnected shopping experience across our stores, branches, online, on the job site, and in their homes, focusing on continued inv estments in our websites and mobile apps to enhance the customer experience.\n\n## Digital Experience\n\nEnhancements to our digital platforms are critical for our increasingly interconnected customers, who often research products and check av ailable inv entory online before going into one of our stores to v iew products in person or talk to an associate and then making their purchase either in store or online. While in the store, customers may also go online to access ratings and rev iews, compare prices, v iew our extended assortment, and purchase additional products. Our inv estments in a truly interconnected experience are focused on bringing together the power of our physical presence and the frictionless interaction of our digital capabilities.\n\nA significant majority of the traffic in Home Depot's digital channels is on mobile dev ices. Mobile users expect more simplicity and relev ancy in their digital interactions. In addition to supporting our DIY and DIFM customers on their shopping journeys, mobile dev ices can also help serv e the needs of Pros working on complex projects. As a result, we hav e made inv estments in our digital platforms to improv e the ov erall presentation and ease of navigation for the user.

Our ability to be competitiv e on deliv ery and pickup times, options and costs depends on many factors, including lev eraging the momentum of our inv estments in our supply chain and our interconnected retail capabilities to further enhance the customer shopping experience.

If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitiv e pressures, including through the deliv ery of a superior interconnected customer experience or through maintenance of effectiv e sales and marketing, advertising or promotional programs lev eraging both our digital and physical platforms, our market share and our financial performance could be adv ersely affected. If we experience inflation or deflation at a lev el beyond our ability to respond effectiv ely, we may not be able to adjust prices to sufficiently offset the effects without negativ ely impacting demand or margins, as applicable, or it may adv ersely affect our ability to compete based on price.\n\nWe may not timely identify or effectively respond to customer needs, expectations or trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services, and our market share.\n\nThe success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to ev olv ing trends in demographics; shifts in customer preferences, expectations and needs; changes in the macroeconomic or political env ironment; and unexpected weather conditions, natural disasters, or public health issues (including pandemics and related impacts) that impact our customers, while also managing appropriate inv entory lev els in our stores, branches and distribution or fulfillment centers and maintaining an excellent customer experience. It is difficult to successfully predict the products and serv ices our customers will demand. As our customers expect a more personalized experience, our ability to collect, use, retain, and protect relev ant customer data is important for effectiv ely meeting their expectations. Our ability to collect and use that data, howev er, is subject to a number of external factors, including the impact of legislation or regulations gov erning data priv acy, data-driv en technologies such as artificial intelligence, and data security, as well as customer expectations around data collection, retention, and use. In addition, each of our primary customer groups has different needs and expectations, many of which ev olv e as the demographics in a particular customer group change. Customer preferences and expectations related to sustainability of products and operations are also changing. If we do not successfully differentiate the shopping experience to attract our customers and meet their indiv idual needs and expectations, it may adv ersely impact our sales or our market share.\n\nCustomer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receiv e products or serv ices are also becoming more demanding. Customers routinely and increasingly use technology and a v ariety of electronic dev ices and digital platforms to rapidly compare products and prices, read product rev iews, determine real-time product av ailability, and purchase products, and new channels and tools to enhance the customer experience appear and change rapidly. Our Pros also look for additional capabilities, including dedicated sales support, competitiv e credit and pricing options, project planning tools, and product depth and job lot quantities, particularly for their complex purchase needs. Once products are purchased, customers seek alternate options for deliv ery of those products, including adv ance ordering through digital platforms for Pros, and they often expect quick, timely, and low-price or free deliv ery and/or conv enient pickup or deliv ery options. We must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the shopping and purchasing process by continuing to adjust and enhance the online and in-store customer experience as well as our deliv ery options.

The broader impact of acts of war and related sanctions, including on macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical tensions, consumer demand and the ability of us and our franchisees to operate in certain geographic areas, may also have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\n\nWhile we may face challenges and uncertainties in any of the markets in which we operate, such challenges and uncertainties are often heightened in developing markets, which may entail a relatively higher risk of political instability, economic volatility, crime, corruption and social and ethnic unrest. In many cases, such challenges may be exacerbated by the lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainty in how local law is applied and enforced, including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment. A n inability to manage effectively the risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\n## Supply chain interruptions may increase costs or reduce revenues.\n\nWe depend on the effectiveness of our supply chain management to assure a reliable and sufficient supply of quality products, equipment and other materials on favorable terms. A lthough many of these items are sourced from a wide variety of suppliers in countries around the world, certain items have limited suppliers, which increases our reliance on those suppliers. Supply chain interruptions and related price increases have in the past and may in the future adversely affect us as well as our suppliers and franchisees, whose performance may have a significant impact on our results. Such interruptions and price increases could be caused by shortages, inflationary pressures, unexpected increases in demand, transportation-related issues, labor-related issues, technology-related issues, weather-related events, natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism or other hostilities, or other factors beyond our control or that of our suppliers or franchisees. Interruptions in our System's supply chain or ineffective contingency planning can increase our costs, impact ingredient quality, delay new restaurant openings, and/or limit the quality  or av ailability  of products, equipment and other materials that are critical to our Sy stem's operations or to restaurant development.\n\n## Our franchise business model presents a number of risks.\n\nOur success as a heavily franchised business relies to a large degree on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees, including our developmental licensees and affiliates. Our restaurant margins arise from two sources: fees from franchised restaurants (e.g., rent and royalties based on a percentage of sales) and, to a lesser degree, sales from Company-owned and operated restaurants. Our franchisees manage their businesses independently and therefore are responsible for the day-to-day operation of their restaurants. The revenues we realize from franchised restaurants are largely dependent on the ability of our franchisees to grow their sales. Business risks affecting our operations also affect our franchisees. If franchisee sales trends worsen, or any of such risks materialize or intensify, our financial results could be negatively affected, which may be material.\n\nOur success also relies on the willingness and ability of our franchisees and affiliates to implement major initiatives, which may include financial investment, and to remain aligned with us on operating, value/promotional and capital-intensive reinvestment plans. The ability of franchisees to contribute to the achievement of our plans is dependent in large part on the availability to them of funding at reasonable interest rates and may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in general, by their or our creditworthiness or by banks' lending practices. If our franchisees are unwilling or unable to invest in major initiatives or are unable to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates, or at all, our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nOur operating performance could also be negatively affected if our franchisees experience food safety or other operational problems or project an image inconsistent with our brand and values, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited, costly to exercise or subjected to litigation and potential delays. If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our required standards, our brand's image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.\n\nOur ownership mix also affects our results and financial condition. The decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise or license agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex. The benefits of our more heavily franchised structure depend on various factors, including whether we have effectively selected franchisees, licensees and/or affiliates that meet our rigorous standards, whether we are able to successfully integrate them into our structure and whether their performance and the resulting ownership mix supports our brand and financial objectives.\n\n## Continued challenges with respect to labor, including availability and cost, could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\n\nOur success depends in part on our System's ability to effectively attract, recruit, develop, motivate and retain qualified individuals to work in M cDonald's restaurants and to maintain appropriately-staffed restaurants in an intensely competitive labor market. We and our franchisees have experienced and may continue to experience challenges in adequately staffing certain M cDonald's restaurants, which can negatively impact operations, including speed of service to customers, and customer satisfaction levels. The System's ability to meet its labor needs as they evolve is generally subject to a variety of factors, including the availability  of sufficient workforce, unemployment levels and prevailing wages in the markets in which we operate.\n\nFurther, our System has experienced increased costs and competition associated with attracting, recruiting, developing, motivating and retaining qualified employees, as well as with promoting awareness of the opportunities of working at M cDonald's restaurants. We and our franchisees also continue to be impacted by increasingly complex U.S. and international laws and regulations affecting our respective workforces. These laws and regulations are increasingly focused on, and in certain cases impose requirements with respect to, employment matters such as wages and hours, healthcare, immigration, retirement and other employee benefits and workplace practices. Such laws and regulations can expose us and our franchisees to increased costs and other effects of compliance, including potential liability, and all such labor and compliance costs could have a negative impact on our Company-owned and operated margins and franchisee profitability.\n\nOur potential exposure to reputational and other harm regarding our workplace practices or conditions or those of our independent franchisees or suppliers, including those giving rise to claims of harassment or discrimination (or perceptions thereof) or workplace safety, could have a negative impact on consumer perceptions of us and our business. A dditionally, economic action, such as boycotts, protests, work stoppages or campaigns by labor organizations, could adversely affect us (including our ability to attract, recruit, dev elop, motiv ate and retain talent) or our franchisees and suppliers, whose performance may have a significant impact on our results.",

          "chunk_text": "Franchisees are responsible for reinvesting capital in their businesses over time. In addition, to accelerate implementation of certain initiatives, the Company may co-invest with franchisees to fund improvements to their restaurants or operating systems. These investments, developed in collaboration with franchisees, are designed to cater to consumer preferences, improve local business performance and increase the value of the M cDonald's brand through the development of modernized, more attractive and higher revenue generating restaurants.\n\nThe Company requires franchisees to meet rigorous standards and generally does not work with passive investors. The business relationship with franchisees is designed to facilitate consistency and high quality at all M cDonald's restaurants. Conventional franchisees contribute to the Company's revenue, primarily through the payment of rent and royalties based upon a percent of sales, with specified minimum rent payments, along with initial fees paid upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new franchise. The Company's heavily franchised business model is designed to generate stable and predictable revenue, which is largely a function of franchisee sales, and resulting cash flow streams.\n\n## Developmental License or Affiliate\n\nUnder a developmental license or affiliate arrangement, licensees are responsible for operating and managing their businesses, providing capital (including the real estate interest) and developing and opening new restaurants. The Company generally does not invest any restaurant capital under a developmental license or affiliate arrangement, and it receives a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally receives initial fees upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new license.\n\nWhile developmental license and affiliate arrangements are largely the same, affiliate arrangements are used in a limited number of foreign markets (primarily China and Japan) within the International Developmental Licensed M arkets &amp; Corporate segment as well as a limited number of individual restaurants within the International Operated M arkets segment, where the Company also has an equity investment and records its share of net results in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates.\n\n## PURPOSE, MISSION AND VALUE S\n\nThrough its size and scale, M cDonald's embraces and prioritizes its role and commitment to the communities in which it operates through its purpose to feed and foster communities, and its mission to make delicious feel-good moments easy for everyone. The Company is guided by five core values that define who it is and how it runs the business across the three-legged stool of M cDonald's franchisees, suppliers, and employees:\n\n1. Serve - We put our customers and people first;\n2. Inclusion - We open our doors to everyone;\n3. Integrity - We do the right thing;\n4. Community - We are good neighbors; and\n5. Family - We get better together.\n\nThe Company believes that its people, all around the world, set it apart and bring these values to life daily.\n\n## HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\nThe Company's people strategies aim to support an inclusive environment that represents the communities in which it operates. To do this, the Company offers quality training and learning opportunities and upholds high standards of health and safety designed to create and maintain a safe and respectful workplace for its employees. In support of the Company's values, the Company's annual incentive plan holds the Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") and Executive Officers accountable for efforts that drive employee engagement and our values.\n\nYou can find more information about the Company's human capital management and related initiatives in our 2023-2024 Purpose &amp; Impact Report and on the 'Our Purpose &amp; Impact' section of the Company's website.\n\n## People\n\nCompany employees, which include those in the Company's corporate and other offices as well as in Company-owned and operated restaurants, totaled over 150,000 worldwide as of year-end 2024, of which approximately 70% were based outside of the U.S. In addition to Company employees, the over two million individuals who work in M cDonald's franchised restaurants around the world are critical to the Company's success, enabling it to drive long-term value creation and further its purpose and mission. People are at the cornerstone of the Company's business and an essential part of the System.\n\n## Commitment to Inclusion\n\nInclusion is one of the Company's core values, which it strives to integrate into business operations to deliver an inclusive experience for stakeholders-including employees, franchisees, suppliers, customers and the communities in which the Company operates.\n\nGrounded in the Company's values, the Company believes in treating everyone with dignity, fairness and respect, always. There are four guiding principles the Company applies to evaluate its work: (i) our system thrives when we are shaped by the communities in which we operate, (ii) our early and full adoption of inclusion gives us a competitive advantage, (iii) individuals perform their best when they feel they belong and (iv) our priority is to be a responsible business, acting lawfully and being responsive to the business environment.\n\n## Safe &amp; Respectful Workplaces\n\nThe Company believes that it has a responsibility to help protect the health and safety of anyone who works at or enters a M cDonald's restaurant, a concept that is incorporated into Company policies, codes of conduct and guiding principles. The Company is committed to promoting safety in all of the Company's corporate and other offices and Company-owned and operated restaurants, as well as supporting franchisees to do the same in the restaurants they own and operate. The Company also works to foster respectful workplaces, where people can be themselves without fear of harassment, discrimination, retaliation or violence, and to help its franchisees do the same in their workplaces.\n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2024 Annual R eport 4",

The pronouncement expands annual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company adopted the new standard in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. Refer to the Segment footnote on page 52 of this Form 10-K for the enhanced disclosures added as a result of the adoption of A SU 2023-07.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\" (\"ASU 2023-09\"). The pronouncement expands the disclosure requirements for income taxes, specifically related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. A SU 2023-09 is effectiv e for fiscal y ears beginning after December 15, 2024. We are currently in the process of determining the impact that A SU 2023-09 will have on the Company's consolidated financial statement disclosures.\n\n## Disaggregation - Income Statement Expenses\n\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, \"Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\" (\"ASU 2024-03\"). The pronouncement expands the disclosure requirements for expenses, specifically by providing more detailed information about the types of expenses in commonly presented expense captions. A SU 2024-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. We are currently in the process of determining the impact that A SU 2024-03 will have on the Company's consolidated financial statement disclosures.\n\n## REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nThe Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-owned and operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to developmental licensees and affiliates include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. The Company's Other revenues are primarily comprised of fees paid by franchisees to recover a portion of costs incurred by the Company for various technology platforms, revenues from brand licensing arrangements to market and sell consumer packaged goods using the M cDonald's brand and thirdparty revenues for the Dynamic Y ield business, for periods prior to its sale on A pril 1, 2022.\n\nSales by Company-owned and operated restaurants are recognized on a cash basis at the time of the underlying sale and are presented net of sales tax and other sales-related taxes. Royalty revenues are based on a percent of sales and recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Rental income includes both minimum rent payments, which are recognized straight-line over the franchise term and variable rent payments based on a percent of sales, which are recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Initial fees are recognized as the Company satisfies the performance obligation over the franchise term, which is generally 20 years.\n\nThe Company provides goods or services related to various technology platforms to certain franchisees that are distinct from the franchise agreement because they do not require integration with other goods or services that the Company provides. The Company has determined that it is the principal in these arrangements. Accordingly, the related revenue is presented on a gross basis on the Consolidated Statement of Income. These revenues are recognized as the goods or services are transferred to the franchisee, and related expenses are recognized as incurred, primarily within Other restaurant expenses. There may be a timing difference between the costs the Company incurs and the related fees the Company receives from franchisees, but the various technology platform fees are not designed to generate margins for the Company. Brand licensing arrangement revenues are based on a percent of sales and are recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. For periods prior to A pril 1, 2022, Dynamic Y ield third party revenues were generated from providing software as a service solutions to customers and were recognized over the applicable subscription period as the service was performed.\n\n## PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and amortization provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildings-up to 40 years; leasehold improvements-the lesser of useful lives of assets or lease terms, which generally include certain option periods; and equipment-3 to 12 years.\n\nThe Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods.\n\nThe Company may share in the cost of certain restaurant improvements with its franchisees. Since M cDonald's generally manages the project and provides up front funding in these instances, during the project the Company estimates which costs are the responsibility of M cDonald's and which are the responsibility of the franchisee, and allocates the corresponding costs between Property and equipment and Accounts receivable. Upon the completion of the project, the allocation of costs is finaliz ed and may result in immaterial adjustments to the balances and associated depreciation expense.\n\nRefer to the Property and Equipment footnote on page 54 of this Form 10-K for additional information.",

      "answer": "General Motors reports equity earnings from Ultium Cells Holdings LLC within its Automotive and other cost of sales, indicating that the entity is integral to its electric vehicle (EV) production strategy. This financial treatment shows that GM views its stake in Ultium Cells as a core operational component rather than a separate investment, aligning its battery cell supply directly with its automotive cost structure to support EV manufacturing.",

For example, a reservation made through Booking.com (which is domiciled in the Netherlands) at a hotel in New York by a consumer in the United States is part of the results of our businesses outside of the U.S. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the revenues from our businesses outside of the U.S. (the substantial majority of which is generated by Booking.com) represented approximately 87% of our consolidated revenues. We earn a significant majority of our revenues from facilitating accommodation reservations. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more geographic information.\n\nOur common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol \"BKNG.\" We refer to our company and all of our subsidiaries and brands collectively as \"Booking Holdings,\" the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"our,\" or \"us.\"\n\n## Our Business Model\n\nWe derive substantially all of our revenues from providing online travel reservation services, which facilitate online travel purchases between travel service providers (which we generally refer to as \"partners\") and travelers (which we generally refer to as \"consumers\"). We also earn revenues from advertising services, restaurant reservations, and various other services, such as travelrelated insurance products and restaurant management services for restaurants.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we had revenues of $11.0 billion, which we classify as \"agency\" revenues, \"merchant\" revenues, and \"advertising and other\" revenues.\n\n- Agency revenues are derived from travel-related transactions where we do not facilitate payments from travelers for the services provided. Agency revenues consist almost entirely of travel reservation commissions from our accommodation, rental car, and airline reservation services.

See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the acquisition of Getaroom in December 2021.\n\nWe review long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based upon the ability to recover the carrying value of the assets from the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, before interest and taxes, of the related asset group. As of December 31, 2021, no impairment indicators were identified for our long-lived assets.\n\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. We test goodwill at a reporting unit level and our annual goodwill impairment tests are performed as of September 30. As of September 30, 2021, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill. No additional impairment indicators were identified as of December 31, 2021.\n\n## 2020 Interim Goodwill Impairment Test\n\nDue to the significant and negative financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements), we performed an interim period goodwill impairment test at March 31, 2020 and recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $489 million related to the OpenTable and KAYAK reporting unit for the three months ended March 31, 2020, which is not tax-deductible, resulting in an adjusted carrying value of goodwill for OpenTable and KAYAK of $1.5 billion at March 31, 2020. The goodwill impairment was primarily driven by a significant reduction in the forecasted near-term cash flows of OpenTable and KAYAK as well as the significant decline in comparable companies' market values as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe estimated fair value of OpenTable and KAYAK was determined using a combination of standard valuation techniques, including an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach (applying the recent decline in enterprise values of comparable publicly-traded companies to the recently calculated fair value for OpenTable and KAYAK as well as applying comparable company multiples).\n\nThe income approach estimates fair value utilizing long-term growth rates and discount rates applied to the cash flow projections. In the cash flow projections, we assumed at the time that OpenTable and KAYAK would experience a significant decline in near-term cash flows with a recovery to 2019 levels of financial performance (including profitability) occurring in 2023. The shape and timing of the recovery was a key assumption in our fair value calculation (both in the income and market approaches).\n\n## 2020 Annual Goodwill Impairment Test\n\nAs of September 30, 2020, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $573 million for the OpenTable and KAYAK reporting unit for the three months ended September 30, 2020, which is not tax-deductible, resulting in an adjusted carrying value of goodwill for OpenTable and KAYAK of $1.0 billion at September 30, 2020. The goodwill impairment was primarily driven by a significant reduction in the forecasted cash flows of OpenTable and KAYAK, reflecting a longer assumed recovery period to 2019 levels of profitability, mainly due to the continued material adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on the flight vertical at KAYAK, and the lowered outlook for monetization opportunities in restaurant reservation services.\n\nThe estimated fair value of OpenTable and KAYAK was determined using a combination of standard valuation techniques, including an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach (applying comparable company multiples).\n\nThe income approach estimates fair value utilizing long-term growth rates and discount rates applied to the cash flow projections. The income approach, applied as of September 30, 2020, reflected a reduction in the forecasted cash flows of OpenTable and KAYAK and a longer assumed recovery period to 2019 levels of profitability, driven primarily by a lowered outlook for monetization opportunities in restaurant reservation services and slower than previously expected recovery trends for airline travel, which is a key vertical for KAYAK. For the interim goodwill impairment test at March 31, 2020, we expected a recovery to 2019 levels of financial performance occurring in 2023 for OpenTable and KAYAK. Based on our evaluation of all relevant information available as of September 30, 2020 for the annual goodwill impairment test, we expected at the time that OpenTable and KAYAK would not return to the 2019 level of profitability within five years from that date, and that it was uncertain whether the shape of the recovery would ultimately match our expectations.

Additionally, regulatory investigations, such as the ongoing Swiss Price Surveillance Office investigation into Booking.com's commission rates, could force Booking.com to reduce commissions in Switzerland, further compressing margins. In the EU, the proposed Digital Markets Act could classify Booking.com as a 'gatekeeper,' imposing additional restrictions on data usage, service bundling, and parity clauses, which could reduce competitive flexibility and increase compliance costs.

          "chunk_text": "their expectations. As part of these ongoing efforts, we have a long-term strategy to build a more integrated offering of multiple elements of travel connected by a payment platform, which we refer to as the \"Connected Trip,\" and we expect these efforts to increase room night growth and revenue growth over time. We may see a negative impact on our operating margins in the near term as we incur the expenses associated with Connected Trip-related investments. Further, to the extent our non-accommodation services (e.g., airline ticket reservation services) have lower margins and grow faster than our accommodation services, whether as part of the Connected Trip or otherwise, our operating margins may be negatively affected. For more information, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - \" We may not be able to keep up with rapid technological or other market changes. \"\n\nAs part of our strategy to provide more payment options to consumers and travel service providers, increase the number and variety of accommodations available on Booking.com, and enable our long-term Connected Trip strategy, Booking.com is increasingly processing transactions on a merchant basis, where it facilitates payments from travelers for the services provided. This allows Booking.com to process transactions for travel service providers and to increase its ability to offer secure and flexible transaction terms to consumers, such as the form and timing of payment. We believe that adding these types of service offerings will benefit consumers and travel service providers, as well as our gross bookings, room night, and earnings growth rates. However, this results in additional expenses for personnel, payment processing, chargebacks (including those related to fraud), and other expenses related to these transactions, which are recorded in \"Personnel\" and \"Sales and other expenses\" in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, as well as associated incremental revenues (e.g., credit card rebates), which are recorded in \"Merchant revenues.\" To the extent more of our business is generated on a merchant basis, we incur a greater level of these merchant-related expenses, which negatively impacts our operating margins despite increases in associated incremental revenues.\n\nWe have established widely used and recognized e-commerce brands through marketing and promotional campaigns. Our marketing expenses, which are comprised of performance marketing and brand marketing expenses, declined significantly as a result of the negative impact on travel demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, our marketing expense increased significantly versus 2020 as a result of the improving demand environment and our own efforts to invest in marketing, but remained below 2019 levels. Our performance marketing expense, which represents a substantial majority of our marketing expense, is primarily related to the use of online search engines (primarily Google), meta-search and travel research services, and affiliate marketing to generate traffic to our platforms. Our brand marketing expense is primarily related to costs associated with producing and airing television advertising, online video advertising (for example, on YouTube and Facebook), online display advertising, and other brand marketing. Total marketing expenses were $3.8 billion, $2.2 billion, and $5.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\n\nMarketing efficiency, expressed as marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings, and performance marketing returns on investment (\"ROIs\") are impacted by a number of factors that are subject to variability and are in some cases outside of our control, including ADRs, costs per click, cancellation rates, foreign currency exchange rates, our ability to convert paid traffic to booking customers, and the timing and effectiveness of our brand marketing campaigns. Marketing efficiency can also be impacted by the extent to which consumers come directly to our platforms for bookings. In 2021, the share of room nights booked by consumers coming directly to our platforms increased as compared to 2020 and 2019, which benefits marketing efficiency.\n\nIn recent years, we observed periods of stable or increasing ROIs. In 2021, ROIs were about in line with 2019 levels and increased versus 2020 when ROIs were negatively impacted by a significant increase in cancellation rates early in the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect volatility in our ROIs as the pandemic continues to affect travel, and that ROIs could be negatively impacted in the future by increased levels of competition and other factors. When evaluating our performance marketing spend, we typically consider several factors for each channel, such as the customer experience on the advertising platform, the incremental traffic we receive, and the anticipated repeat rate from a particular platform. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - \" We rely on marketing channels to generate a significant amount of traffic to our platforms and grow our business. \" and \" Our business could be negatively affected by changes in online search and meta-search algorithms and dynamics or traffic-generating arrangements. \"\n\nHistorically, our growth has primarily been generated by the worldwide accommodation reservation business of our most significant brand, Booking.com, due in part to the availability of a large number of properties through Booking.com. Booking.com included approximately 2.4 million properties on its website at December 31, 2021, consisting of over 400,000 hotels, motels, and resorts, and over 1.9 million homes, apartments, and other unique places to stay, all of which were about in line with the number of properties on its website at December 31, 2020. Booking.com categorizes properties listed on its website as either (a) hotels, motels, and resorts, which groups together more traditional accommodation types (including hostels and inns), or (b) homes, apartments, and other unique places to stay, also referred to as alternative accommodations, which encompasses all other types of accommodations, including bed and breakfasts, villas, apart-hotels, and beyond.

To the extent that these or any other investigations or inquiries result in additional commitments, fines, damages, or other remedies, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.\n\nAs markets evolve and NCAs or other governmental authorities continue to monitor our industry, new investigations of the industry generally or of us specifically could and have occurred, including revisiting issues that were the subject of prior investigations. While we believe that we are complying with our commitments, investigating authorities or third parties may determine that we are not complying with the commitments we have made and decide to pursue legal action to compel compliance or seek other remedies. Further, in September 2017 the Swiss Price Surveillance Office opened an investigation into the level of commissions of Booking.com in Switzerland and the investigation is ongoing. If there is an adverse outcome and Booking.com is unsuccessful in any appeal, Booking.com could be required to reduce its commissions in Switzerland. We are cooperating with regulators where applicable, but we are unable to predict what, if any, effect any investigations or resolutions thereof, including the effect of any commitments we might make, will have on our business, industry practices, or online commerce more generally.\n\nTo the extent that regulatory authorities impose fines on us or require changes to our business practices or to those currently common to the industry, our business, competitive position, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Negative publicity regarding competition and/or consumer law investigations could adversely affect our brands and therefore our business, market share, and results of operations. Competition and consumer law-related investigations, legislation, or issues have and could in the future result in private litigation.\n\nAnother area of regulatory inquiry involves contractual search term bidding restrictions where one contracting party agrees not to bid on certain key search terms related to the other party (e.g., such other party's name). Although we are generally moving away from these types of agreements, in some of our contracts, we or the other party have agreed to bidding restrictions. If bidding restrictions are held to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable or if we remove them from all of our contracts, it could negatively impact our performance marketing efficiency, business, and results of operations.\n\nThere is significant legislative and public focus on the technology industry, especially as technology companies become larger. In some instances, countries have passed legislation that goes further to restrict business activities than actions taken by NCAs or other regulatory authorities. France, Italy, Belgium, Portugal, and Austria have passed legislation prohibiting parity contract clauses in their entirety and, last year, a German court ruled that our narrow parity clauses are not permitted. Additionally, the EU's Platform to Business Regulation regulates the relationship between online platforms such as Booking.com and European business users of online platforms. In December 2020, the European Commission proposed the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act, which are expected to give regulators more instruments to investigate digital businesses and impose new rules on certain digital platforms if they are determined to be \"gatekeepers.\" The proposed legislation is not final and it is not entirely known what the laws will look like in their final forms. If regulators were to presume that we are a gatekeeper under the Digital Markets Act as currently proposed and we are not successful in rebutting that presumption, we would be subject to additional rules and regulations not applicable to all our competitors and our business could be harmed. For example, the rules applicable to gatekeepers could impose limitations on data collection and usage across services or with third parties, as well as on bundling services, and could require gatekeepers to share certain customer information with partners. Wide and possibly any type of parity clauses could be prohibited for gatekeeper platforms. Additionally, in July 2021 President Biden of the United States signed an executive order aimed at restricting anticompetitive practices, including those within the technology industry. Any rules or regulations that result from this executive order, as well as any other new laws and regulations and changing public perception relating to the technology industry could impact our services, require us to change our business practices, or otherwise cause us to incur additional operating costs to comply with or address these developments. Further, as market conditions change as a result of investigations, litigation, legislation, or political or social pressure, we may decide to voluntarily modify our business practices beyond what is required, the full effects of which may not be known when making the decision, but which could harm our competitive position and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\nWith additional attention on the size of travel or technology companies generally, our size and market share may negatively affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval of proposed acquisitions, our ability to expand into complementary businesses or our latitude in dealing with travel service providers (such as by limiting our ability to provide discounts, rebates, or incentives or to exercise contractual rights), any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or ability to grow and compete.",

          "chunk_text": "## Contingencies\n\nLoss contingencies (other than income tax-related contingencies) arise from actual or possible claims and assessments and pending or threatened litigation that may be brought against the Company by individuals, governments or other entities. Based on the Company's assessment of loss contingencies at each balance sheet date, a loss is recorded in the financial statements if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.\n\n## Segment Reporting\n\nThe Company historically determined that its primary brands constituted its operating segments. In 2019, reflecting changes to the management structure, the Company reorganized its operating segments from six to four operating segments by combining Booking.com with Rentalcars.com and KAYAK with OpenTable. The Company's Booking.com and Rentalcars.com operating segment represents a substantial majority of the Company's total revenues and operating income. The Company's operating segments continue to be aggregated into one reportable segment based on the similarity in economic characteristics, other qualitative factors and the objectives and principles of ASC 280, Segment Reporting. For geographic information, see Note 18.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted\n\n## Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\n\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued a new accounting update relating to income taxes. This update provides an exception to the general methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period when a year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated loss for the year. This update also (1) requires an entity to recognize a franchise tax (or similar tax) that is partially based on income as an income-based tax and account for any incremental amount incurred as a non-income-based tax, (2) requires an entity to evaluate when a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill should be considered part of the business combination in which goodwill was originally recognized for accounting purposes and when it should be considered a separate transaction, and (3) requires that an entity reflect the effect of an enacted change in tax laws or rates in the annual effective tax rate computation in the interim period that includes the enactment date.\n\nThe Company adopted this update on January 1, 2021 and applied the applicable amendments on a prospective basis. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Accounting for Acquired Revenue Contracts with Customers in a Business Combination\n\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued a new accounting update that requires an acquirer to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , rather than at fair value on the acquisition date as required under current U.S. GAAP. The Company early adopted this update during the fourth quarter of 2021 and applied it retrospectively to all business combinations occurring on or after January 1, 2021.\n\n## Other Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n\n## Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity\n\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued a new accounting update relating to convertible instruments and contracts in an entity's own equity. For convertible instruments, the accounting update reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. Limiting the accounting models results in fewer embedded conversion features being separately recognized from the host contract as compared with current U.S. GAAP. The accounting update amends the guidance for the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity's own equity to reduce form-over-substance-based accounting conclusions.\n\nThe Company adopted this update on January 1, 2022 on a modified retrospective basis, which resulted in an increase of approximately $30 million to retained earnings. For the Company's convertible debt instruments, interest expense for the periods beginning after January 1, 2022 will be reflected in the financial statements using interest rates that typically are closer to the coupon interest rate of such instruments rather than a generally higher imputed interest expense that resulted from the separation of conversion features required by previous U.S. GAAP. See Note 12 for additional information on the Company's convertible debt instruments. The accounting update also requires changes in the diluted earnings per share calculation in certain areas, including the use of the if-converted method instead of the treasury stock method which was permitted in certain situations under current U.S. GAAP. See Note 8 for additional information on earnings per share.",

See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the acquisition of Getaroom in December 2021.\n\nWe review long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based upon the ability to recover the carrying value of the assets from the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, before interest and taxes, of the related asset group. As of December 31, 2021, no impairment indicators were identified for our long-lived assets.\n\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. We test goodwill at a reporting unit level and our annual goodwill impairment tests are performed as of September 30. As of September 30, 2021, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill. No additional impairment indicators were identified as of December 31, 2021.\n\n## 2020 Interim Goodwill Impairment Test\n\nDue to the significant and negative financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements), we performed an interim period goodwill impairment test at March 31, 2020 and recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $489 million related to the OpenTable and KAYAK reporting unit for the three months ended March 31, 2020, which is not tax-deductible, resulting in an adjusted carrying value of goodwill for OpenTable and KAYAK of $1.5 billion at March 31, 2020. The goodwill impairment was primarily driven by a significant reduction in the forecasted near-term cash flows of OpenTable and KAYAK as well as the significant decline in comparable companies' market values as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe estimated fair value of OpenTable and KAYAK was determined using a combination of standard valuation techniques, including an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach (applying the recent decline in enterprise values of comparable publicly-traded companies to the recently calculated fair value for OpenTable and KAYAK as well as applying comparable company multiples).\n\nThe income approach estimates fair value utilizing long-term growth rates and discount rates applied to the cash flow projections. In the cash flow projections, we assumed at the time that OpenTable and KAYAK would experience a significant decline in near-term cash flows with a recovery to 2019 levels of financial performance (including profitability) occurring in 2023. The shape and timing of the recovery was a key assumption in our fair value calculation (both in the income and market approaches).\n\n## 2020 Annual Goodwill Impairment Test\n\nAs of September 30, 2020, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $573 million for the OpenTable and KAYAK reporting unit for the three months ended September 30, 2020, which is not tax-deductible, resulting in an adjusted carrying value of goodwill for OpenTable and KAYAK of $1.0 billion at September 30, 2020. The goodwill impairment was primarily driven by a significant reduction in the forecasted cash flows of OpenTable and KAYAK, reflecting a longer assumed recovery period to 2019 levels of profitability, mainly due to the continued material adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on the flight vertical at KAYAK, and the lowered outlook for monetization opportunities in restaurant reservation services.\n\nThe estimated fair value of OpenTable and KAYAK was determined using a combination of standard valuation techniques, including an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach (applying comparable company multiples).\n\nThe income approach estimates fair value utilizing long-term growth rates and discount rates applied to the cash flow projections. The income approach, applied as of September 30, 2020, reflected a reduction in the forecasted cash flows of OpenTable and KAYAK and a longer assumed recovery period to 2019 levels of profitability, driven primarily by a lowered outlook for monetization opportunities in restaurant reservation services and slower than previously expected recovery trends for airline travel, which is a key vertical for KAYAK. For the interim goodwill impairment test at March 31, 2020, we expected a recovery to 2019 levels of financial performance occurring in 2023 for OpenTable and KAYAK. Based on our evaluation of all relevant information available as of September 30, 2020 for the annual goodwill impairment test, we expected at the time that OpenTable and KAYAK would not return to the 2019 level of profitability within five years from that date, and that it was uncertain whether the shape of the recovery would ultimately match our expectations.

Business\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has continued to profoundly impact our business, employees, partners, consumers, communities, and stockholders. We were encouraged to see the distribution of vaccines and the development of other medical interventions to COVID-19 during 2021, but the emergence of new variants continues to make the shape and timing of a recovery uncertain. We remain confident that over time there will be a strong recovery for travel demand globally, and are focused on executing on our key strategic priorities so we emerge from this period in a position of strength. As we continue our efforts to make our brands the most trusted and convenient platforms for consumers and partners, we have taken important actions in 2021 including:\n\n- expanding and enhancing our flight product at Booking.com, which is a key component of our Connected Trip vision;\n- entering into an agreement to acquire Etraveli Group in November and completing our acquisition of Getaroom in December;\n- increasing our internal collaboration efforts;\n- continuing to build out our payments platform and payments capabilities across the Company; and\n- launching new product features to make travel more sustainable and inclusive.\n\nOur mission to make it easier for everyone to experience the world remains unchanged. We seek to empower people to cut through travel barriers, such as money, time, language, and overwhelming options, so they can use our services to easily and confidently get where they want to go, stay where they want to stay, dine where they want to dine, pay how they want to pay, and experience what they want to experience. We connect consumers wishing to make travel reservations with travel service providers around the world through our online platforms, which allow consumers to: book a broad array of accommodations (including hotels, motels, resorts, homes, apartments, bed and breakfasts, hostels, and other alternative and traditional accommodations properties) and a flight to their destination; make a car rental reservation or arrange for an airport taxi; make a dinner reservation; or book a vacation package, tour, activity, or cruise. Consumers can also use our meta-search services to easily compare travel reservation information, such as flight, hotel, and rental car reservations, from hundreds of online travel platforms at once. In addition, we offer other services to consumers and partners, such as travel-related insurance products and restaurant management services to restaurants.\n\nWe offer these services through six primary consumer-facing brands: Booking.com, Priceline, agoda, Rentalcars.com, KAYAK, and OpenTable. We continue to increase the collaboration, cooperation, and interdependency among our brands to provide consumers with the most comprehensive services and maximize the benefits of our scale. For example, when a traveler books an accommodation through Booking.com, we may offer relevant rental car or airport transfer transportation services",

If the investigation results in an adverse ruling and Booking.com is unsuccessful in any appeal, it could be required to reduce its commissions in Switzerland.

To the extent that these or any other investigations or inquiries result in additional commitments, fines, damages, or other remedies, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.\n\nAs markets evolve and NCAs or other governmental authorities continue to monitor our industry, new investigations of the industry generally or of us specifically could and have occurred, including revisiting issues that were the subject of prior investigations. While we believe that we are complying with our commitments, investigating authorities or third parties may determine that we are not complying with the commitments we have made and decide to pursue legal action to compel compliance or seek other remedies. Further, in September 2017 the Swiss Price Surveillance Office opened an investigation into the level of commissions of Booking.com in Switzerland and the investigation is ongoing. If there is an adverse outcome and Booking.com is unsuccessful in any appeal, Booking.com could be required to reduce its commissions in Switzerland. We are cooperating with regulators where applicable, but we are unable to predict what, if any, effect any investigations or resolutions thereof, including the effect of any commitments we might make, will have on our business, industry practices, or online commerce more generally.\n\nTo the extent that regulatory authorities impose fines on us or require changes to our business practices or to those currently common to the industry, our business, competitive position, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Negative publicity regarding competition and/or consumer law investigations could adversely affect our brands and therefore our business, market share, and results of operations. Competition and consumer law-related investigations, legislation, or issues have and could in the future result in private litigation.\n\nAnother area of regulatory inquiry involves contractual search term bidding restrictions where one contracting party agrees not to bid on certain key search terms related to the other party (e.g., such other party's name). Although we are generally moving away from these types of agreements, in some of our contracts, we or the other party have agreed to bidding restrictions. If bidding restrictions are held to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable or if we remove them from all of our contracts, it could negatively impact our performance marketing efficiency, business, and results of operations.\n\nThere is significant legislative and public focus on the technology industry, especially as technology companies become larger. In some instances, countries have passed legislation that goes further to restrict business activities than actions taken by NCAs or other regulatory authorities. France, Italy, Belgium, Portugal, and Austria have passed legislation prohibiting parity contract clauses in their entirety and, last year, a German court ruled that our narrow parity clauses are not permitted. Additionally, the EU's Platform to Business Regulation regulates the relationship between online platforms such as Booking.com and European business users of online platforms. In December 2020, the European Commission proposed the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act, which are expected to give regulators more instruments to investigate digital businesses and impose new rules on certain digital platforms if they are determined to be \"gatekeepers.\" The proposed legislation is not final and it is not entirely known what the laws will look like in their final forms. If regulators were to presume that we are a gatekeeper under the Digital Markets Act as currently proposed and we are not successful in rebutting that presumption, we would be subject to additional rules and regulations not applicable to all our competitors and our business could be harmed. For example, the rules applicable to gatekeepers could impose limitations on data collection and usage across services or with third parties, as well as on bundling services, and could require gatekeepers to share certain customer information with partners. Wide and possibly any type of parity clauses could be prohibited for gatekeeper platforms. Additionally, in July 2021 President Biden of the United States signed an executive order aimed at restricting anticompetitive practices, including those within the technology industry. Any rules or regulations that result from this executive order, as well as any other new laws and regulations and changing public perception relating to the technology industry could impact our services, require us to change our business practices, or otherwise cause us to incur additional operating costs to comply with or address these developments. Further, as market conditions change as a result of investigations, litigation, legislation, or political or social pressure, we may decide to voluntarily modify our business practices beyond what is required, the full effects of which may not be known when making the decision, but which could harm our competitive position and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\nWith additional attention on the size of travel or technology companies generally, our size and market share may negatively affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval of proposed acquisitions, our ability to expand into complementary businesses or our latitude in dealing with travel service providers (such as by limiting our ability to provide discounts, rebates, or incentives or to exercise contractual rights), any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or ability to grow and compete.",

      "answer": "Nike's investment in U.S. Agency securities remained unchanged at $2 million from May 31, 2021, to May 31, 2022. In contrast, their investment in U.S. Treasury securities increased from $2,892 million to $3,801 million, representing an increase of $909 million.

      "question": "How might Starbucks' customer experience initiatives, particularly those involving digital engagement and mobile ordering, negatively impact its financial results if not successfully executed, and what specific risks related to these initiatives are highlighted in the company's risk factors?",
      "answer": "Starbucks' customer experience initiatives, including investments in digital engagement, mobile order and payment systems, and mobile ordering process enhancements, are critical to its long-term business objectives. If these initiatives are not successfully executed or fail to generate the expected results, Starbucks may not fully realize the intended benefits of these significant investments, which could materially harm its business and results of operations. Additionally, the misallocation of time and resources toward these initiatives could negatively impact other areas of the business. Specific risks related to these initiatives include potential failure in customer adoption of new technologies, challenges in maintaining consistency across digital platforms, and the possibility of diverting resources from other organizational priorities, all of which could lead to a material adverse effect on financial performance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - 'If these customer experience initiatives are not successfully executed or do not generate expected results, our financial results may suffer' and 'we will fail to achieve optimal allocation of resources, which could materially harm our business and results of operations.'",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - 'the impact of our marketing strategies, promotional and advertising plans, pricing strategies, platforms, reformulations, innovations, or customer experience initiatives or investments' and 'changes in consumer preferences, demand, consumption, or spending behavior, including due to shifts in demographic or health and wellness trends, reduction in discretionary spending and price increases, and our ability to anticipate or react to these changes.'",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Starbucks' financial results are tied to the success of its customer experience initiatives, particularly in digital and mobile domains. Evidence from both chunks shows that failure in execution or consumer adoption could lead to financial underperformance. Additionally, resource misallocation and evolving consumer behavior are highlighted as specific risks that could negatively impact the company."

If we are not successful in implementing our strategic initiatives, or, in the event we undertake large acquisitions, integrations, and divestitures, we may be required to evaluate whether certain assets, including goodwill and other intangibles, have become impaired. In the event we record an impairment charge, it could have a material impact on our financial results.\n\n## Our investments to transform and enhance the customer experience, including through technology, may not generate the expected results.\n\nOur long-term business objectives depend on the successful execution of our strategies. We continue to build upon our investments in development, technology, digital engagement, and delivery in order to transform and enhance the customer experience. As part of these investments, we continue to focus on improving our service model and strengthening relationships with customers, in part through digital channels and loyalty initiatives, mobile order and payment systems, and enhancement of our technologies. We also continue to expand and refine our mobile ordering process. If these customer experience initiatives are not successfully executed or do not generate expected results, or if we do not fully realize the intended benefits of these significant investments, our financial results may suffer. It is also possible that the greater allocation of time and resources to these customer experience initiatives versus other organizational priorities could negatively impact other areas of our business, or that we will fail to achieve optimal allocation of resources, which could materially harm our business and results of operations.\n\n## Evolving consumer preferences and tastes, as well as adverse public or medical opinions about the health effects of consuming our products, may adversely affect our business.\n\nOur continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain customers. Our financial results could be adversely affected by a shift in consumer spending away from outside-the-home food and beverages (such as a reduction in discretionary spending); lack of customer acceptance of new products (including due to price increases necessary to cover the costs of new products or higher input costs), brands (such as the global expansion of the Starbucks brand), and platforms (such as features of our mobile technology, changes in our loyalty rewards programs, and our delivery services initiatives); or customers reducing their demand for our current offerings as new products are introduced. In addition, some of our products contain caffeine, dairy products, sugar, and other compounds and allergens, the health effects of which are the subject of public and regulatory scrutiny, including the suggestion of linkages to a variety of adverse health effects. Particularly in the U.S., there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks, including obesity, as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food and beverage products. An unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products, whether or not accurate, imposition of additional tax es on certain types of food and beverage components, or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products and materially harm our business and results of operations. Changes in diet (whether due to changes in consumer behavior and eating habits, use of weight-loss drugs, or other factors) could also influence the demand for our offerings and materially harm our business and results of operations.

Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They often include words such as 'believes,' 'expects,' 'anticipates,' 'estimates,' 'intends,' 'plans,' 'seeks,' or words of similar meaning, or future or conditional verbs, such as 'will,' 'should,' 'could,' 'may,' 'aims,' 'intends,' or 'projects,' and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties, and other factors (many beyond our control) that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical experience or from our current expectations or projections.

Starbucks Cards are issued to customers when they initially load them with an account balance. They can be obtained in our company-operated and most licensed stores in North America, China, Japan, and many of our other markets in our International segment. Starbucks Cards can also be obtained online, via the Starbucks Mobile App, and through other U.S. and international retailers. Customers may access their card balances by utilizing their Starbucks Card or the Starbucks Mobile App in participating stores. In nearly all markets, including the U.S. and Canada, customers who register their Starbucks Cards are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program. Registered members can receive various benefits depending on factors such as the number of reward points ('Stars') earned. In addition to using their Starbucks Cards, Starbucks Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at all company-operated stores and a majority of licensed stores in North America. Using the Mobile Order and Pay functionality of the Starbucks Mobile App, customers can also place orders in advance for pick-up at certain participating locations in several markets. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for further discussion of our Starbucks Cards and loyalty program. \u00ae \u00ae\n\n## Licensed Stores\n\nRevenues from our licensed stores accounted for 12% of total net revenues in fiscal 2024. Licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a margin on branded products and supplies sold to the licensed store operator along with a royalty on retail sales. Licensees are responsible for operating costs and capital investments, which more than offset the lower revenues we receive under the licensed store model.\n\nIn our licensed store operations, we seek to leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience. Licensees provide improved, and at times the only, access to desirable retail space. Most licensees are prominent retailers with in-depth market knowledge and access. As part of these arrangements, we sell coffee, tea, food, and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees. We also sell certain equipment, such as coffee brewers and espresso machines, to our licensees for use in their operations. Licensee employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in company-operated stores. In a limited number of international markets, we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores.",

Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are required to be backstopped by available commitments under our 2021 credit facility. The proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs, capital ex penditures, and other corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, business ex pansion, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. As of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program.\n\n## Credit Facilities in Japan\n\nAdditionally, we hold the following Japanese yen-denominated credit facilities that are available for working capital needs and capital expenditures within our Japanese market:\n\n- A \u00a55.0 billion, or $34.5 million, credit facility is currently set to mature on December 30, 2024. Borrowings under this credit facility are subject to terms defined within the facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate ('TIBOR') plus an applicable margin of 0.400%.\n- A \u00a510.0 billion, or $69.1 million, credit facility is currently set to mature on March 27, 2025. Borrowings under this credit facility are subject to terms defined within the facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on TIBOR plus an applicable margin of 0.300%.\n\nAs of September 29, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities. As of October 1, 2023, we had \u00a55.0 billion, or $33.5 million, of borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities.\n\nSee Note 9, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for details of the components of our long-term debt.\n\nOur ability to incur new liens and conduct sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties is subject to compliance with terms of the indentures under which the long-term notes were issued. As of September 29, 2024, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants.\n\n## Use of Cash\n\nWe expect to use our available cash and investments, including, but not limited to, additional potential future borrowings under the credit facilities, commercial paper program, and the issuance of debt to support and invest in our core businesses, including investing in new ways to serve our customers and supporting our store partners, repaying maturing debts, returning cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and discretionary share repurchases, and investing in new business opportunities related to our core and developing businesses. Furthermore, we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our investees. We may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business. Acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our investees. Any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy.\n\nWe believe that net future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally, combined with our ability to leverage our balance sheet through the issuance of debt, will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses as well as shareholder distributions for at least the nex t 12 months. We are currently not aware of any trends or demands, commitments, events, or uncertainties that will result in, or that are reasonably likely to result in, our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way that will impact our capital needs during or beyond the nex t 12 months. We have borrowed funds and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates; however, additional borrowings would result in increased interest ex pense in the future. In this regard, we may incur additional debt, within targeted levels, as part of our plans to fund our capital programs, including cash returns to shareholders through future dividends and discretionary share repurchases, refinancing debt maturities, as well as investing in new business opportunities. If necessary, we may pursue additional sources of financing, including both short-term and long-term borrowings and debt issuances.\n\nWe regularly review our cash positions and our determination of partial indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings. In the event we determine that all or another portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes, which could be material. Any foreign earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested may be repatriated at management's discretion. During fiscal 2024, we paid approximately $18 million for foreign withholding taxes related to repatriating the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. See Note 14, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for further discussion.",

      "question": "How does General Motors' valuation methodology for Stellantis warrants and their sensitivity to equity price risk inform the potential financial impact of a 10% adverse change in Stellantis stock price on GM's equity investments in 2021?",
      "answer": "General Motors estimates the fair value of its Stellantis warrants using the Black-Scholes formula, which incorporates inputs such as the Stellantis stock price and estimated dividend yield. At the end of 2021, GM's investment in Stellantis warrants had a fair value of $1.5 billion. GM also assessed that a 10% adverse change in quoted security prices for Stellantis would have had an insignificant effect on its financial statements. This suggests that even though the valuation methodology is sensitive to stock price changes, the overall financial impact of a 10% adverse movement in Stellantis stock would not have been material to GM\u2019s equity investments in 2021.",

        "Step 3: Also from evidence_source_b, GM estimated that a 10% adverse change in Stellantis stock prices would have had an insignificant effect on its financial statements.",

The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries  whose  local  currency  is  not  their  functional  currency  are  remeasured  from  their  local  currency  to  their  functional currency and then translated to U.S. Dollars. Revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. Dollars using the average exchange rates prevailing for each period presented. The financial statements of any foreign subsidiary that has been identified as having a highly inflationary economy are remeasured as if the functional currency were the U.S. Dollar.\n\nGains  and  losses  arising  from  foreign  currency  transactions  and  the  effects  of  remeasurements  discussed  in  the  preceding paragraph are recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales and GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses unless related to Automotive debt, which are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. Foreign currency transaction and remeasurement gains were $17 million, losses of $203 million and gains of $85 million in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value. The accounting  for  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  each  derivative  financial  instrument  depends  on  whether  it  has  been  designated  and qualifies  as  an  accounting  hedge,  as  well  as  the  type  of  hedging  relationship  identified.  Derivative  instruments  are  not  used  for trading or speculative purposes.\n\nAutomotive We utilize options, swaps and forward contracts to manage foreign currency and commodity price risk. The change in fair value of option and forward contracts not designated as hedges is recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. Cash flows for all derivative financial instruments are classified in cash flows from operating activities.\n\nWe estimate the fair value of the Stellantis warrants using a Black-Scholes formula. The significant inputs to the model include the Stellantis stock price and the estimated dividend yield. We are entitled to receive any dividends declared by Stellantis through the conversion date upon exercise of the warrants. Gains or losses as a result of the change in the fair value of the Stellantis warrants are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net.\n\nAutomotive Financing - GM Financial GM Financial utilizes interest rate derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk and foreign currency derivative instruments to manage foreign currency risk. The change in fair value of the derivative instruments not designated as hedges is recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses. Cash flows for all derivative financial instruments are classified in cash flows from operating activities.\n\nCertain interest rate and foreign currency swap agreements have been designated as fair value hedges. The risk being hedged is the risk of changes in the fair value of the hedged debt attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate or the risk of changes in fair value attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If the swap has been designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses. The change in fair value of the related hedge is also recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses.\n\nCertain interest rate swap and foreign currency swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges. The risk being hedged is  the  interest  rate  and foreign currency risk related to forecasted transactions. If the contract has been designated as a cash flow hedge, the change in the fair value of the cash flow hedge is deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and is recognized in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses along with the earnings effect of the hedged item when the hedged item affects earnings.

The potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have been insignificant at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nEquity Price Risk We are subject to equity price risk due to market price volatility primarily related to our investment in Stellantis warrants and other insignificant investments. The fair value of investments with exposure to equity price risk was $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Our investment in Stellantis warrants is valued based on a Black-Scholes formula. We estimate that a 10% adverse change in quoted security prices in Stellantis would have had an insignificant effect at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nInterest Rate Risk Fluctuations in market interest rates can affect GM Financial's gross interest rate spread, which is the difference between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid on debt. GM Financial is exposed to interest rate risks as financial assets and liabilities have different characteristics that may impact financial performance. These differences may include tenor, yield, re-pricing  timing,  and  prepayment  expectations. Typically  retail  finance  receivables  and  leases  purchased  by  GM  Financial  earn fixed interest and commercial finance receivables originated by GM Financial earn variable interest. GM Financial funds its business with variable or fixed rate debt. The variable rate debt is subject to adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates. To help mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding, GM Financial may employ hedging.\n\nQuantitative Disclosure GM Financial measures the sensitivity of its net interest income to changes in interest rates by using interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous parallel shift of one hundred basis points in all interest rates across all  maturities,  as  well  as  a  base  case  that  assumes  that  rates  perform  at  the  current  market  forward  curve.  However,  interest  rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in our analysis. Therefore,  the  actual  impact  to  net  interest  income  could  be  higher  or  lower  than  the  results  detailed  in  the  table  below.  These interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent our view of future interest rate movements.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, GM Financial was liability-sensitive, meaning that more liabilities than assets were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest paid on liabilities would increase more than the interest earned on assets, which would initially decrease net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially increase. At December 31, 2020, GM Financial was asset-sensitive, meaning that more assets than liabilities were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest earned on assets would increase more than the interest paid on liabilities, which would initially increase net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially decrease.\n\nGM Financial's net interest income sensitivity decreased in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increased proportion of rate sensitive liabilities exposure relative to rate sensitive assets exposure. GM Financial's hedging strategies approved by its global asset liability committee are used to manage interest rate risk within policy guidelines.

The fair value of marketable debt securities decreased by $0.4 billion (from $9.0 billion in 2020 to $8.6 billion in 2021).

The potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have been insignificant at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nEquity Price Risk We are subject to equity price risk due to market price volatility primarily related to our investment in Stellantis warrants and other insignificant investments. The fair value of investments with exposure to equity price risk was $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Our investment in Stellantis warrants is valued based on a Black-Scholes formula. We estimate that a 10% adverse change in quoted security prices in Stellantis would have had an insignificant effect at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nInterest Rate Risk Fluctuations in market interest rates can affect GM Financial's gross interest rate spread, which is the difference between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid on debt. GM Financial is exposed to interest rate risks as financial assets and liabilities have different characteristics that may impact financial performance. These differences may include tenor, yield, re-pricing  timing,  and  prepayment  expectations. Typically  retail  finance  receivables  and  leases  purchased  by  GM  Financial  earn fixed interest and commercial finance receivables originated by GM Financial earn variable interest. GM Financial funds its business with variable or fixed rate debt. The variable rate debt is subject to adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates. To help mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding, GM Financial may employ hedging.\n\nQuantitative Disclosure GM Financial measures the sensitivity of its net interest income to changes in interest rates by using interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous parallel shift of one hundred basis points in all interest rates across all  maturities,  as  well  as  a  base  case  that  assumes  that  rates  perform  at  the  current  market  forward  curve.  However,  interest  rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in our analysis. Therefore,  the  actual  impact  to  net  interest  income  could  be  higher  or  lower  than  the  results  detailed  in  the  table  below.  These interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent our view of future interest rate movements.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, GM Financial was liability-sensitive, meaning that more liabilities than assets were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest paid on liabilities would increase more than the interest earned on assets, which would initially decrease net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially increase. At December 31, 2020, GM Financial was asset-sensitive, meaning that more assets than liabilities were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest earned on assets would increase more than the interest paid on liabilities, which would initially increase net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially decrease.\n\nGM Financial's net interest income sensitivity decreased in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increased proportion of rate sensitive liabilities exposure relative to rate sensitive assets exposure. GM Financial's hedging strategies approved by its global asset liability committee are used to manage interest rate risk within policy guidelines.

      "answer": "When McDonald's acquires franchised restaurants, it records goodwill as the excess cost over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets. If a Company-operated restaurant is sold within 24 months of acquisition, the goodwill associated with the acquisition is written off in its entirety. However, if a Company-operated restaurant is sold beyond 24 months from acquisition, the amount of goodwill written off is based on the relative fair value of the business sold compared to the reporting unit. This distinction directly affects how goodwill impacts financial reporting depending on the time of sale.",

      "answer": "Franchisees contribute to over 93% of McDonald's global workforce, as over two million individuals work in franchised restaurants compared to over 150,000 company employees. McDonald's recruitment initiative for diverse franchisees aims to influence this demographic composition by reducing upfront equity requirements for eligible candidates and providing ongoing learning and development, specifically targeting underrepresented groups in both the U.S. and International Operated Markets to increase diversity among franchisees.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - McDonald's company employees totaled over 150,000 worldwide as of year-end 2023.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Over two million individuals work in McDonald's franchised restaurants globally, making them critical to the company's success.",

The recruitment initiative directly targets this majority segment by aiming to increase diversity among franchisees, thereby influencing the demographic composition of the broader McDonald's workforce."

      "question": "How does McDonald's financial exposure from franchisee performance impact its goodwill accounting when acquiring and subsequently selling restaurants, based on the risks described in the franchise business model and the goodwill valuation methodology?",
      "answer": "McDonald's financial exposure from franchisee performance impacts its goodwill accounting significantly when acquiring and selling restaurants. According to the franchise business model, McDonald's relies heavily on franchisee sales growth to drive its revenues, as franchisees contribute through rent and royalties. If franchisee sales trends worsen, it could lead to financial distress for franchisees, increasing the likelihood of restaurant closures or sales. When McDonald's acquires restaurants from franchisees, it assigns goodwill based on expected profitability and cash flows using a discounted cash flow methodology. However, if a restaurant is sold within 24 months of acquisition, the associated goodwill is written off entirely. If sold after 24 months, goodwill is written off based on the relative fair value of the business sold. Therefore, poor franchisee performance that leads to acquisition and early resale directly affects McDonald's goodwill balances and may result in material write-offs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - McDonald's business model relies on franchisee success, particularly for sales growth, which directly affects McDonald's revenues through rent and royalties.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - Poor franchisee performance, including financial distress or closures, can have a material negative impact on McDonald's financial results.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b - Goodwill is assigned when McDonald's acquires restaurants from franchisees, based on expected profitability and cash flows (discounted cash flow methodology).",
        "Step 4: Extract from evidence_source_b - If a restaurant is sold within 24 months of acquisition, the associated goodwill is written off in full; if sold after 24 months, the write-off is proportional.",
        "Step 5: Synthesize - Poor franchisee performance can trigger acquisitions by McDonald's, which then carry goodwill risk. If these restaurants are sold quickly, McDonald's faces full goodwill write-offs, directly impacting financial results."

      "question": "How does McDonald's (MCD) valuation methodology for acquiring restaurants from franchisees impact the treatment of goodwill when those restaurants are sold within or beyond 24 months of acquisition, and what is the financial implication of this policy on goodwill write-offs?",
      "answer": "McDonald's uses a discounted cash flow methodology (Level 3 inputs) to determine the fair value of restaurants acquired from franchisees. If a restaurant is sold within 24 months of acquisition, the entire goodwill associated with that acquisition is written off. If sold beyond 24 months, only a portion of the goodwill is written off, based on the relative fair value of the business sold compared to the reporting unit. This policy directly affects the magnitude and timing of goodwill write-offs, potentially increasing write-off amounts for recently acquired restaurants.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - McDonald's uses a discounted cash flow methodology (Level 3 inputs) to determine the fair value of restaurants acquired from franchisees.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - If a Company-operated restaurant is sold within 24 months of acquisition, the goodwill associated with the acquisition is written off in its entirety.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_a - If sold beyond 24 months, the amount of goodwill written off is based on the relative fair value of the business sold compared to the reporting unit.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The valuation and write-off policy creates a financial incentive to hold acquired restaurants beyond 24 months to minimize full goodwill write-offs, directly influencing the company's balance sheet and earnings volatility."

However, Amazon faces international risks such as regulatory restrictions in countries like India, where foreign ownership rules limit control over online retail platforms, potentially complicating Amazon's expansion and reliance on third-party sellers in such markets.",

      "answer": "Amazon's total potential financial commitment toward Anthropic, PBC is $4 billion, which includes an initial $1.25 billion convertible note investment in Q3 2023 and an agreement to invest up to an additional $2.75 billion in a second convertible note, which expires in Q1 2024. This commitment reflects Amazon's broader financial strategy of investing in strategic technology partnerships to support its long-term growth, particularly in areas like artificial intelligence and cloud infrastructure through AWS. The investment is part of a commercial arrangement that includes the provision of AWS cloud services and the use of AWS chips, aligning with Amazon's focus on expanding its technological capabilities and ecosystem.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Amazon invested $1.25 billion in a convertible note from Anthropic, PBC, in 2023.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Adding the $1.25 billion and the potential $2.75 billion yields a total potential commitment of $4 billion. This investment is part of a broader commercial arrangement involving AWS cloud services and AWS chips, indicating strategic alignment and financial support for long-term growth in AI and cloud infrastructure."

      "answer": "Third-party sellers were a key driver of unit sales growth in both North America and International segments in 2023. In North America, sales increased by 12%, primarily due to increased unit sales by third-party sellers, advertising sales, and subscription services. Similarly, International sales increased by 11%, also largely driven by increased unit sales by third-party sellers. Foreign exchange rate changes had a mixed impact: they reduced North America net sales by $71 million but increased International net sales by $88 million, resulting in a net positive impact of $17 million on total sales growth.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Amazon's international operations are significantly influenced by third-party sellers, as noted in the discussion of www.amazon.in and contractual structures in India.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - North America sales grew by 12%, and International sales grew by 11%, both primarily driven by increased unit sales by third-party sellers.",
        "Step 3: Extract the impact of foreign exchange rates - Foreign exchange rates reduced North America sales by $71 million and increased International sales by $88 million.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The contribution of third-party sellers is a common factor in both segments' growth, and the net effect of foreign exchange rate changes on total sales is $88M - $71M = $17M."

      "question": "How do Amazon's $52M foreign exchange-related fulfillment cost increases tied to third-party seller growth and India's regulatory restrictions on foreign ownership jointly impact its operational strategy and cost allocation in international markets?",
      "answer": "Amazon's fulfillment costs increased by $52 million in 2023 due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations linked to the growth of third-party sellers using Fulfillment by Amazon services. This increase necessitates continued investment in the fulfillment network to accommodate both Amazon\u2019s own sales and third-party seller inventory. Simultaneously, in India, Amazon must operate under strict regulatory frameworks that limit foreign ownership in online retail. To comply, Amazon provides marketing and logistics services to third-party sellers on www.amazon.in and holds an indirect minority interest in a seller entity, rather than directly operating the marketplace. These regulatory constraints add operational complexity and cost, particularly in logistics and infrastructure, as Amazon cannot fully integrate its services or control the seller ecosystem directly. As a result, Amazon must balance the growing fulfillment demands from international third-party sellers with the higher-cost, localized operational structures required in markets like India, affecting both its international expansion pace and cost allocation strategies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Fulfillment costs increased in 2023, with $52 million attributed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations driven by third-party seller growth.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - In India, Amazon operates under restrictive foreign ownership laws and must use indirect structures involving third-party sellers, which adds compliance and operational complexity.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The $52M FX-related cost increase from third-party seller growth necessitates infrastructure investment globally, while India\u2019s regulatory restrictions force Amazon into higher-cost, indirect operational models, jointly shaping Amazon\u2019s international cost structure and fulfillment strategy."

      "answer": "Amazon depends on third-party sellers to offer a wide range of products to customers, and in certain international markets like India and China, the company partners with these sellers under complex regulatory structures. In India, Amazon provides marketing and logistics services to third-party sellers due to restrictions on foreign ownership in online retail, and holds an indirect minority interest in a seller on Amazon.in. In China, Amazon partners with third parties to comply with local ownership and cybersecurity regulations for technology services. These arrangements expose Amazon to risks such as regulatory non-compliance, limited control over seller operations, and potential reputational damage if local laws or policies change, which could hinder international growth and profitability.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Amazon's business model includes third-party sellers, and the company earns fees from these sellers without being the seller of record.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Amazon faces international operational risks, particularly in India and China, where it must structure its operations through third-party partnerships due to local regulatory restrictions.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Amazon's reliance on third-party sellers is central to its marketplace model, but in markets like India and China, this dependence is compounded by regulatory constraints that require specific partnership structures, increasing the complexity and risk of international operations."

We offer our customers a wide assortment of building materials, home improvement products, lawn and garden products, d\u00e9cor products, and facilities maintenance, repair and operations products and provide a number of services, including home improvement installation services and tool and equipment rental. As of the end of fiscal 2021, we operated 2,317 stores located throughout the U.S. (including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam), Canada, and Mexico. The Home Depot stores average approximately 104,000 square feet of enclosed space, with approximately 24,000 additional square feet of outside garden area. We also maintain a network of distribution and fulfillment centers, as well as a number of e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. When we refer to 'The Home Depot,' the 'Company,' 'we,' 'us' or 'our' in this report, we are referring to The Home Depot, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated in 1978. Our Store Support Center (corporate office) is located at 2455 Paces Ferry Road, Atlanta, Georgia 30339. Our telephone number at that address is (770) 433-8211.\n\n## Our Business\n\n## Our Strategy\n\nThe retail landscape has changed rapidly over the past several years, with customer expectations constantly evolving. In fiscal 2021, this trend continued due to the challenges created by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the broader domestic and global business environment, including supply chain disruptions, tight labor market conditions, and inflationary pressures. To navigate this dynamic environment and meet heightened levels of home improvement demand throughout the year, we had to operate with agility while also managing evolving requirements to support customer and associate safety.\n\nOur ability to operate successfully and meet the needs of our customers was due in significant part to our strategic investments over the past several years aimed at creating an interconnected, frictionless shopping experience that enables our customers to seamlessly blend the digital and physical worlds. Going forward, we will leverage the momentum of these strategic investments and continue to invest in our business in support of the following goals:\n\n- We intend to provide the best customer experience in home improvement;\n- We intend to extend our position as the low-cost provider in home improvement; and\n- We intend to be the most efficient investor of capital in home improvement.\n\nWe believe that these goals will help us grow faster than the market and deliver value to our shareholders. We are steadfast in this commitment, while also recognizing that exercising corporate responsibility and being informed by the needs of our other stakeholders, including our customers, associates, supplier partners, and communities, creates value for all stakeholders, including our shareholders.\n\n## Deliver Shareholder Value\n\nWe deliver on our objective to create shareholder value through our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Our capital allocation principles are as follows:\n\n- First, we intend to reinvest in our business to drive growth faster than the market.\n- Second, after meeting the needs of the business, we look to return excess cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We intend to increase our dividend as we grow earnings.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we invested $2.6 billion in capital expenditures to support an interconnected customer experience. We also focused on driving productivity throughout the business to lower our costs. The combination of reinvesting in the business to drive higher sales and driving productivity to lower costs creates what we refer to as a virtuous cycle, which has allowed us to improve the customer experience, increase our competitiveness in the market, and deliver shareholder value.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we returned approximately $22 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We paid $7.0 billion in cash dividends and returned approximately $15.0 billion to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases in fiscal 2021. Our capital allocation is discussed further in Item 7, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.'\n\n## PART I",

Enhancements to our digital properties are critical for our increasingly interconnected customers, who research products online and check available inventory before going into one of our stores to view the products in person or talk to an associate and then make their purchase in store or online. While in the store, customers may also go online to access ratings and reviews, compare prices, view our extended assortment, and purchase additional products. Our investments in a truly interconnected experience are focused on bringing together the power of our physical retail presence and the frictionless interaction of our digital capabilities.\n\nA significant majority of the traffic in our digital channels is on a mobile device. Mobile customers expect more simplicity and relevancy in their digital interactions. As a result, we have made significant investments to our digital properties to improve the overall presentation and ease of navigation for the user. We have also enhanced the 'shopability' of an online product by including more information on the product's landing page, including related products and/or parts of a collection, and a multitude of fulfillment options. Our focus on improving search capabilities, site functionality, category presentation, product content, speed to checkout, and enhanced fulfillment options has yielded higher traffic, better conversion and continued sales growth. It has also been critical during the COVID-19 pandemic, as customers have gravitated even more to the digital environment.\n\nFurther, we do not view the interconnected shopping experience as a specific transaction; rather, we believe it encompasses an entire journey from inspiration and know-how, to purchase and fulfillment, to post-purchase care and support. Customers expect more personalized messaging, so we are focusing on connecting marketing activities with the online and in-store experiences to create a seamless series of engagements across channels. From the inspirational point of the purchase journey to providing product know-how, we are continuing to invest in the infrastructure and capabilities needed to deliver the most relevant marketing messages to our customers based upon what is important for them today.\n\nStore Experience. Our stores remain the hub of our business, and we are investing to improve the customer shopping experience through easier navigation and increasing the convenience and speed of checkout. For several years, our associates have used web-enabled handheld devices we call 'GET phones' to help expedite the online order checkout process, locate products in the aisles and online, and check inventory on hand. To improve the customer's experience in our stores, we have also empowered our customers with additional self-help tools, including mobile app-enabled store navigation. Our app provides store-specific maps, which allow customers to pinpoint the exact location of an item on their mobile devices.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we leveraged the investments made in our stores over the past several years to operate effectively in the dynamic environment we faced throughout the year. These investments include our wayfinding sign and store refresh package in all of our U.S. stores; our self-service lockers, online order storage areas at front entrances, and curbside pickup, which offer convenient pickup options for online orders; electronic shelf label capabilities; and the re-design of the front-end area, including reconfigured service desks, improved layouts in all checkout areas, and expanded and enhanced self-checkout options. We believe these investments are driving higher customer satisfaction scores, and we will continue to invest to improve the customer experience going forward.\n\nInvesting in Associate Productivity. We continually strive to improve our store operations for our associates. Our goal is to remove complexity and inefficient processes from the stores to allow our associates to focus on our customers. To this end, we have continued to focus our efforts in such areas as optimizing product flow to decrease the amount of time a store associate spends locating product and to improve on-shelf product availability; creating a simpler order management system; expanding in-aisle, real-time mobile learning tools for our associates' own development and to assist with customer questions; and using labor model tools to better align associate activity with customer needs.\n\nInvesting in Safety. We are committed to maintaining a safe shopping and working environment for our customers and associates. We empower trained EH&amp;S associates to evaluate, develop, implement and enforce policies, processes and programs on a Company-wide basis. Our EH&amp;S policies are woven into our everyday operations and are part of The Home Depot culture. Common program elements include: daily store inspection checklists (by department); routine follow-up audits from our store-based safety team members and regional, district and store operations field teams; equipment enhancements and preventative maintenance programs to promote physical safety; departmental merchandising safety standards; training and education programs for all associates, with varying degrees of training provided based on an associate's role and responsibilities; and awareness,",

      "answer": "The acquisition of HD Supply in fiscal 2020, which involved a net consideration of $7.8 billion, significantly increased Home Depot's cash outflows from investing activities. This led to a decrease in cash used in investing activities by $7.2 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to the absence of such a large acquisition in 2021. To finance this acquisition and other activities, Home Depot raised $7.9 billion in long-term debt in fiscal 2020, which contributed to the company's financing activities. In fiscal 2021, the company continued to manage its capital structure by securing $3.0 billion in net proceeds from long-term debt, partially offsetting the cash outflows from share repurchases and dividend payments.",

In fiscal 2021, the absence of a similar acquisition led to a decrease in cash used in investing activities, while the company continued to manage its capital structure through debt issuance."

Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, associate compensation, operations, occupancy costs, and income taxes.\n\nCash provided by or used in operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at any point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $2.3 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 and was primarily driven by changes in working capital, partially offset by an increase in net earnings. Working capital was impacted by higher merchandise inventories resulting from our efforts to continue to meet the demand environment and from higher product and transportation costs, along with timing of vendor payments.\n\nInvesting Activities. Cash used in investing activities decreased by $7.2 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to $7.8 billion of net consideration paid to acquire HD Supply in fiscal 2020, partially offset by increased capital expenditures.\n\nFinancing Activities. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2021 primarily reflected $14.8 billion of share repurchases, $7.0 billion of cash dividends paid, and $1.5 billion of repayments of long-term debt, partially offset by $3.0 billion of net proceeds from long-term debt and $1.0 billion of net proceeds from short-term debt.\n\nCash used in financing activities in fiscal 2020 primarily reflected $6.5 billion of cash dividends paid, $2.9 billion of repayments of long-term debt, $974 million of net repayments of short-term debt, and $791 million for share repurchases prior to our suspension of share repurchases in March 2020, partially offset by $7.9 billion of net proceeds from long-term debt.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies\n\nOur significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the representation of our financial condition and results of operations, and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates.\n\n## Merchandise Inventories\n\nWe value the majority of our inventory under the retail inventory method, using the first-in, first-out method, with the remainder of our inventories valued under a cost method. Under the retail inventory method, inventories are stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories.",

      "answer": "The increase in merchant basis transaction mix from 44% in 2022 to 54% in 2023 led to higher merchant-related expenses, which negatively impacted Booking.com's operating margins despite associated incremental revenues. Key cost components included personnel expenses, payment processing fees, and chargebacks (including those related to fraud), all of which are recorded in 'Personnel' expenses and 'Sales and other expenses' in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. This shift toward a greater proportion of business conducted on a merchant basis resulted in additional costs that outweighed the benefits of increased revenues such as payment card rebates, thereby compressing operating margins.",

      "question": "How did McDonald's refranchising activities, as reflected in the gains on sale of subsidiaries, and the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic combine to influence McDonald's 2022 financial results?",
      "answer": "McDonald's refranchising activities, such as the sale of its stake in McDonald's Japan, contributed to gains on sale of subsidiaries, which are included in the 'Impairment and other charges (gains), net' line and represent a recurring part of the company's business strategy. These gains positively impacted operating income. However, the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including labor shortages, supply chain disruptions, and changes in consumer behavior, adversely affected McDonald's financial results. The combination of these two factors created a mixed financial impact: refranchising generated one-time gains and potentially reduced operational complexity, while the pandemic continued to pressure revenue growth and increase operating costs. Therefore, while refranchising contributed positively to the 2022 financials, the pandemic's lingering effects offset some of these benefits, influencing the overall financial outlook.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, extract that McDonald's realized gains from the divestiture of ownership percentages in subsidiaries, such as the sale of McDonald's Japan stock in 2020 and 2021, which reduced ownership from 49% to 35%. These gains are recorded under 'Impairment and other charges (gains), net' and are a recurring part of the company's business strategy.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, extract that the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic caused disruptions in global operations, labor availability issues, supply chain interruptions, and changes in consumer behavior, all of which negatively affected McDonald's financial results in 2022.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize that while refranchising activities provided financial gains and strategic benefits, the pandemic's effects created ongoing operational and financial challenges, resulting in a complex financial outcome for 2022 that reflects both positive and negative forces."

          "chunk_text": "## RISK FACTORS\n\nOur business results are subject to a variety of risks, including those that are described below and elsewhere in our filings with the SEC. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business. If any of these risks materialize or intensify, our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change and our performance may be adversely affected.\n\n## GLOBAL PANDEMIC\n\n## The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected and is expected to continue to adversely affect our financial results, condition and outlook.\n\nHealth epidemics or pandemics can adversely affect consumer spending and confidence levels and supply availability and costs, as well as the local operations in impacted markets, all of which can affect our financial results, condition and outlook. Importantly, the global pandemic resulting from COVID-19 has disrupted global health, economic and market conditions, consumer behavior and McDonald's global restaurant operations since early 2020, and has resulted in increased pressure on labor availability and supply chain management. Local and national governmental mandates or recommendations and public perceptions of the risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have caused, and we expect will continue to cause, consumer behavior to change, worsening or volatile economic conditions in certain markets, and increased regulatory complexity and compliance costs, each of which could continue to adversely affect our business. In addition, our global operations have been disrupted to varying degrees in different markets and may continue to be disrupted to varying degrees given the unpredictability of the virus, its resurgences and variants and government responses thereto as well as potentially permanent changes to the industry in which we operate. While we cannot predict the duration or scope of the COVID-19 pandemic, the resurgence of infections or the emergence of new variants in one or more markets, the availability, acceptance or effectiveness of vaccines or vaccination rates across the globe, the pandemic has negatively impacted our business and is expected to continue to impact our financial results, condition and outlook in a way that may be material.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may also heighten other risks disclosed in these Risk Factors, including, but not limited to, those related to labor availability and costs, supply chain interruptions, commodity costs, consumer behavior, consumer perceptions of our brand and competition.\n\n## STRATEGY AND BRAND\n\n## If we do not successfully evolve and execute against our business strategies, including the Accelerating the Arches strategy, we may not be able to drive business growth.\n\nTo drive Systemwide sales, operating income and free cash flow growth, our business strategies must be effective in maintaining and strengthening customer appeal and capturing additional market share. Whether these strategies are successful depends mainly on our System's ability to:\n\n- capitalize on our global scale, iconic brand and local market presence to build upon our historic strengths and competitive advantages, such as our marketing, core menu items and digital, delivery and drive thru;\n- continue to innovate and differentiate the McDonald's experience, including by preparing and serving our food in a way that balances value and convenience to our customers with profitability;\n- accelerate technology investments for a fast and easy customer experience;\n- continue to run great restaurants by driving efficiencies and expanding capacities while continuing to prioritize health and safety;\n- identify and develop restaurant sites consistent with our plans for net growth of Systemwide restaurants;\n- accelerate our existing strategies, including through growth opportunities and potential acquisitions, investments and partnerships; and\n- evolve and adjust our business strategies in response to, among other things, changing consumer behavior, operational restrictions and impacts to our results of operations and liquidity, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIf we are delayed or unsuccessful in executing our strategies, or if our strategies do not yield the desired results, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\n\n## Failure to preserve the value and relevance of our brand could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\n\nTo be successful in the future, we believe we must preserve, enhance and leverage the value of our brand, including our corporate purpose, mission and values. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions, which are affected by a variety of factors, including the nutritional content and preparation of our food, the ingredients we use, the manner in which we source commodities and general business practices across the System, including the people practices at McDonald's restaurants. Consumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons, and some changes can occur rapidly. For example, nutritional, health, environmental and other scientific studies and conclusions, which constantly evolve and may have contradictory implications, drive popular opinion, litigation and regulation (including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior) in ways that affect the 'informal eating out' ('IEO') segment or perceptions of our brand, generally or relative to available alternatives. Our business could also be impacted by business incidents or practices, whether actual or perceived, particularly if they receive considerable publicity or result in litigation, as well as by our position or perceived lack of position on environmental, social responsibility, public policy, geopolitical and similar matters. Consumer perceptions may also be affected by adverse commentary from third parties, including through social media or conventional media outlets, regarding the quick-service category of the IEO segment or our brand, culture, operations, suppliers or franchisees. If we are unsuccessful in addressing adverse commentary or perceptions, whether or not accurate, our brand and financial results may suffer.",

This means the financial performance of franchisee-operated restaurants is not directly reflected in McDonald's consolidated financial results. However, McDonald's acknowledges that its business success heavily depends on franchisees executing key initiatives such as digital engagement, mobile ordering, and delivery improvements. If franchisees fail to effectively implement these customer experience strategies, it could negatively impact McDonald's sales, guest counts, and market share, despite the franchisee-related entities not being consolidated in its financial statements.",

Investments in affiliates owned 50% or less (primarily McDonald's China and Japan) are accounted for by the equity method.\n\nOn an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its business relationships such as those with franchisees, joint venture partners, developmental licensees, suppliers and advertising cooperatives to identify potential variable interest entities. Generally, these businesses qualify for a scope exception under the variable interest entity consolidation guidance. The Company has concluded that consolidation of any such entity is not appropriate for the periods presented.\n\n## ESTIMATES IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\n## FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION\n\nGenerally, the functional currency of operations outside the U.S. is the respective local currency.\n\n## RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIn December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') issued Accounting Standard Update ('ASU') No. 2019-12, 'Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes' ('ASU 2019-12'), which simplifies the accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including applicable interim periods. The Company adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2021. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\n\n## Reference Rate Reform\n\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, 'Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting\" ('ASU 2020-04'). The pronouncement provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the current guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. The guidance was effective upon issuance and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated on or before December 31, 2022. The adoption of ASU 2020-04 will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Leases\n\nIn July 2021, the FASB issued No. ASU 2021-05, \"Leases (Topic 842): Lessors-Certain Leases with Variable Lease Payments\" (\"ASU 202105\"). The pronouncement amends the current guidance on classification for a lease that includes variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate. Under the amended guidance, a lessor must classify as an operating lease any lease that would otherwise be classified as a sales-type or direct financing lease and that would result in the recognition of a selling loss at lease commencement. ASU 2021-05 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including applicable interim periods. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.",

          "chunk_text": "## If we do not anticipate and address evolving consumer preferences and effectively execute our pricing, promotional and marketing plans, our business could suffer.\n\nOur continued success depends on our System's ability to build upon our historic strengths and competitive advantages. In order to do so, we need to anticipate and respond effectively to continuously shifting consumer demographics and trends in food sourcing, food preparation, food offerings, and consumer behavior and preferences, including with respect to environmental and social responsibility matters, in the IEO segment. If we are not able to predict, or quickly and effectively respond to, these changes, or if our competitors predict or respond more effectively, our financial results could be adversely impacted.\n\nOur ability to build upon our strengths and advantages also depends on the impact of pricing, promotional and marketing plans across the System, and the ability to adjust these plans to respond quickly and effectively to evolving customer behavior and preferences, as well as shifting economic and competitive conditions. Existing or future pricing strategies and marketing plans, as well as the value proposition they represent, are expected to continue to be important components of our business strategy. However, they may not be successful, or may not be as successful as the efforts of our competitors, which could negatively impact sales, guest counts and market share.\n\nAdditionally, we operate in a complex and costly advertising environment. Our marketing and advertising programs may not be successful in reaching our customers in the way we intend. Our success depends in part on whether the allocation of our advertising and marketing resources across different channels, including digital marketing, allows us to reach our customers effectively, efficiently and in ways that are meaningful to them. If our advertising and marketing programs are not successful, or are not as successful as those of our competitors, our sales, guest counts and market share could decrease.\n\n## Our investments to enhance the customer experience, including through technology, may not generate the expected results.\n\nOur long-term business objectives depend on the successful Systemwide execution of our strategies. We continue to build upon our investments in technology and modernization, digital engagement and delivery in order to transform the customer experience. As part of these investments, we are continuing to place emphasis on improving our service model and strengthening relationships with customers, in part through digital channels and loyalty initiatives, mobile ordering and payment systems, and enhancing our drive thru technologies, which may not generate expected results. We also continue to offer and refine our delivery initiatives, including through growing awareness and trial. Utilizing a third-party delivery service may not have the same level of profitability as a non-delivery transaction, and may introduce additional food quality, food safety and customer satisfaction risks. If these customer experience initiatives are not well executed, or if we do not fully realize the intended benefits of these significant investments, our business results may suffer.\n\n## We face intense competition in our markets, which could hurt our business.\n\nWe compete primarily in the IEO segment, which is highly competitive. We also face sustained, intense competition from traditional, fast casual and other competitors, which may include many non-traditional market participants such as convenience stores, grocery stores, coffee shops and online retailers. We expect our environment to continue to be highly competitive, and our results in any particular reporting period may be impacted by a contracting IEO segment or by new or continuing actions, product offerings or consolidation of our competitors and third-party partners, which may have a short- or long-term impact on our results.\n\nWe compete on the basis of product choice, quality, affordability, service and location. In particular, we believe our ability to compete successfully in the current market environment depends on our ability to improve existing products, successfully develop and introduce new products, price our products appropriately, deliver a relevant customer experience, manage the complexity of our restaurant operations, manage our investments in technology and modernization, and respond effectively to our competitors' actions or offerings or to unforeseen disruptive actions. There can be no assurance these strategies will be effective, and some strategies may be effective at improving some metrics while adversely affecting other metrics, which could have the overall effect of harming our business.\n\n## We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property or adequately ensure that we are not infringing the intellectual property of others, which could harm the value of the McDonald's brand and our business.\n\nThe success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products.\n\nWe have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. The trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the U.S. in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries. It may be costly and time consuming to protect our intellectual property, and the steps we have taken to do so in the U.S. and foreign countries may not be adequate. In addition, the steps we have taken may not adequately ensure that we do not infringe the intellectual property of others, and third parties may claim infringement by us in the future. In particular, we may be involved in intellectual property claims, including often aggressive or opportunistic attempts to enforce patents used in information technology systems, which might affect our operations and results. Any claim of infringement, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and harm our business.\n\nWe cannot ensure that franchisees and other third parties who hold licenses to our intellectual property will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property.",

          "chunk_text": "## FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nThe information in this report contains forward-looking statements about future events and circumstances and their effects upon revenues, expenses and business opportunities. Generally speaking, any statement in this report not based upon historical fact is a forward-looking statement. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by the use of forward-looking or conditional words, such as 'could,' 'should,' 'can,' 'continue,' 'estimate,' 'forecast,' 'intend,' 'look,' 'may,' 'will,' 'expect,' 'believe,' 'anticipate,' 'plan,' 'remain,' 'confident' and 'commit' or similar expressions. In particular, statements regarding plans, strategies, prospects and expectations regarding the business and industry are forwardlooking statements. They reflect expectations, are not guarantees of performance and speak only as of the dates the statements are made. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include those reflected in the Risk Factors section on page 28 of this Form 10-K and elsewhere in McDonald's Corporation's filings with the SEC. Except as required by law, McDonald's Corporation does not undertake to update such forward-looking statements. You should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements.\n\n## ABOUT McDONALD'S\n\nMcDonald's Corporation, the registrant, together with its subsidiaries, is referred to herein as the \"Company.\" The Company, its franchisees and suppliers are referred to herein as the \"System.\"\n\n## BUSINESS SUMMARY\n\n## GENERAL\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, there were no material changes to the Company's corporate structure or in its method of conducting business. Refer to the Segment and Geographic Information section on page 50 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\n\n## DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS\n\nThe Company franchises and operates McDonald's restaurants, which serve a locally relevant menu of quality food and beverages in communities across 119 countries. Of the 40,031 McDonald's restaurants at year-end 2021, 37,295, or 93%, were franchised.\n\nThe Company's reporting segments are aligned with its strategic priorities and reflect how management reviews and evaluates operating performance. Significant reportable segments include the United States (\"U.S.\") and International Operated Markets. In addition, there is the International Developmental Licensed Markets &amp; Corporate segment, which includes markets in over 80 countries, as well as Corporate activities.\n\nMcDonald's franchised restaurants are owned and operated under one of the following structures - conventional franchise, developmental license or affiliate. The optimal ownership structure for an individual restaurant, trading area or market (country) is based on a variety of factors, including the availability of individuals with entrepreneurial experience and financial resources, as well as the local legal and regulatory environment in critical areas such as property ownership and franchising. The business relationship between McDonald's and its independent franchisees is supported by adhering to standards and policies, including Global Brand Standards defined in 2021, and is of fundamental importance to overall performance and to protecting the McDonald's brand.\n\nThe Company is primarily a franchisor and believes franchising is paramount to delivering great-tasting food, locally relevant customer experiences and driving profitability. Franchising enables an individual to be their own employer and maintain control over all employment related matters, marketing and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the strength of McDonald's global brand, operating system and financial resources.\n\nDirectly operating McDonald's restaurants contributes significantly to the Company's ability to act as a credible franchisor. One of the strengths of the franchising model is that the expertise from operating Company-owned restaurants allows McDonald's to improve the operations and success of all restaurants while innovations from franchisees can be tested and, when viable, efficiently implemented across relevant restaurants. Having Company-owned and operated restaurants provides Company personnel with a venue for restaurant operations training experience. In addition, in Company-owned and operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, the Company is able to further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies that will ultimately benefit McDonald's restaurants.\n\nThe Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment, if any, and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms. The Company's Other revenues are comprised of technology fees paid by franchisees, revenues from brand licensing arrangements and third-party revenues for the Dynamic Yield business.\n\n## Conventional Franchise\n\nUnder a conventional franchise arrangement, the Company generally owns or secures a long-term lease on the land and building for the restaurant location and the franchisee pays for equipment, signs, seating and d\u00e9cor. The Company believes that ownership of real estate, combined with the co-investment by franchisees, enables us to achieve restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry.\n\nFranchisees are responsible for reinvesting capital in their businesses over time. In addition, to accelerate implementation of certain initiatives, the Company may co-invest with franchisees to fund improvements to their restaurants or operating systems. These investments, developed in collaboration with franchisees, are designed to cater to consumer preferences, improve local business performance and increase the value of the Company's brand through the development of modernized, more attractive and higher revenue generating restaurants.\n\nThe Company requires franchisees to meet rigorous standards and generally does not work with passive investors. The business relationship with franchisees is designed to facilitate consistency and high quality at all McDonald's restaurants.

          "chunk_text": "## If we do not anticipate and address evolving consumer preferences and effectively execute our pricing, promotional and marketing plans, our business could suffer.\n\nOur continued success depends on our System's ability to build upon our historic strengths and competitive advantages. In order to do so, we need to anticipate and respond effectively to continuously shifting consumer demographics and trends in food sourcing, food preparation, food offerings, and consumer behavior and preferences, including with respect to environmental and social responsibility matters, in the IEO segment. If we are not able to predict, or quickly and effectively respond to, these changes, or if our competitors predict or respond more effectively, our financial results could be adversely impacted.\n\nOur ability to build upon our strengths and advantages also depends on the impact of pricing, promotional and marketing plans across the System, and the ability to adjust these plans to respond quickly and effectively to evolving customer behavior and preferences, as well as shifting economic and competitive conditions. Existing or future pricing strategies and marketing plans, as well as the value proposition they represent, are expected to continue to be important components of our business strategy. However, they may not be successful, or may not be as successful as the efforts of our competitors, which could negatively impact sales, guest counts and market share.\n\nAdditionally, we operate in a complex and costly advertising environment. Our marketing and advertising programs may not be successful in reaching our customers in the way we intend. Our success depends in part on whether the allocation of our advertising and marketing resources across different channels, including digital marketing, allows us to reach our customers effectively, efficiently and in ways that are meaningful to them. If our advertising and marketing programs are not successful, or are not as successful as those of our competitors, our sales, guest counts and market share could decrease.\n\n## Our investments to enhance the customer experience, including through technology, may not generate the expected results.\n\nOur long-term business objectives depend on the successful Systemwide execution of our strategies. We continue to build upon our investments in technology and modernization, digital engagement and delivery in order to transform the customer experience. As part of these investments, we are continuing to place emphasis on improving our service model and strengthening relationships with customers, in part through digital channels and loyalty initiatives, mobile ordering and payment systems, and enhancing our drive thru technologies, which may not generate expected results. We also continue to offer and refine our delivery initiatives, including through growing awareness and trial. Utilizing a third-party delivery service may not have the same level of profitability as a non-delivery transaction, and may introduce additional food quality, food safety and customer satisfaction risks. If these customer experience initiatives are not well executed, or if we do not fully realize the intended benefits of these significant investments, our business results may suffer.\n\n## We face intense competition in our markets, which could hurt our business.\n\nWe compete primarily in the IEO segment, which is highly competitive. We also face sustained, intense competition from traditional, fast casual and other competitors, which may include many non-traditional market participants such as convenience stores, grocery stores, coffee shops and online retailers. We expect our environment to continue to be highly competitive, and our results in any particular reporting period may be impacted by a contracting IEO segment or by new or continuing actions, product offerings or consolidation of our competitors and third-party partners, which may have a short- or long-term impact on our results.\n\nWe compete on the basis of product choice, quality, affordability, service and location. In particular, we believe our ability to compete successfully in the current market environment depends on our ability to improve existing products, successfully develop and introduce new products, price our products appropriately, deliver a relevant customer experience, manage the complexity of our restaurant operations, manage our investments in technology and modernization, and respond effectively to our competitors' actions or offerings or to unforeseen disruptive actions. There can be no assurance these strategies will be effective, and some strategies may be effective at improving some metrics while adversely affecting other metrics, which could have the overall effect of harming our business.\n\n## We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property or adequately ensure that we are not infringing the intellectual property of others, which could harm the value of the McDonald's brand and our business.\n\nThe success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products.\n\nWe have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. The trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the U.S. in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries. It may be costly and time consuming to protect our intellectual property, and the steps we have taken to do so in the U.S. and foreign countries may not be adequate. In addition, the steps we have taken may not adequately ensure that we do not infringe the intellectual property of others, and third parties may claim infringement by us in the future. In particular, we may be involved in intellectual property claims, including often aggressive or opportunistic attempts to enforce patents used in information technology systems, which might affect our operations and results. Any claim of infringement, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and harm our business.\n\nWe cannot ensure that franchisees and other third parties who hold licenses to our intellectual property will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property.",

      "question": "How does the Starbucks Rewards loyalty program impact Starbucks' revenue recognition timing, and what was the company's total advertising expense in fiscal 2022?",
      "answer": "The Starbucks Rewards loyalty program causes a deferral in revenue recognition. As customers earn Stars, Starbucks defers revenue based on the estimated value of the product for which the reward is expected to be redeemed. Revenue is only recognized when the reward is actually redeemed. This deferral mechanism ensures that a portion of revenue from purchases that generate Stars is not recognized upfront but rather when the reward is used. In fiscal 2022, Starbucks incurred $416.7 million in advertising expenses.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - The loyalty program defers revenue as Stars are earned, based on the estimated value of the product for which the reward will be redeemed, and revenue is recognized only upon redemption.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source A - Starbucks' advertising expense in fiscal 2022 was $416.7 million.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Loyalty Program\n\nCustomers in the U.S., Canada and certain other countries who register their Starbucks Card are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program, which is primarily a spend-based loyalty program. They earn loyalty points ('Stars') in a variety of ways, including with each purchase at participating Starbucks stores and when making purchases with the Starbucks-branded credit cards. Starbucks Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at company-operated stores in the U.S. and Canada. After accumulating a certain number of Stars, the customer earns a reward that can be redeemed for free product that, regardless of where the related Stars were earned within that country, will be honored at company-operated stores and certain participating licensed store locations in that same country.\n\nWe defer revenue associated with the estimated selling price of Stars earned by Starbucks Rewards members towards free product as each Star is earned and a corresponding liability is established in deferred revenue. This deferral is based on the estimated value of the product for which the reward is expected to be redeemed, net of estimated unredeemed Stars. Stars generally expire after six months.\n\nWhen a customer redeems an earned reward, we recognize revenue for the redeemed product and reduce the related deferred revenue.\n\n## Other Revenues\n\nOther revenues primarily include royalty revenues, sales of packaged coffee, tea and a variety of ready-to-drink beverages and single-serve coffee and tea products to customers outside of our company-operated and licensed stores. Sales of these products are generally recognized upon shipment to customers, depending on contract terms.\n\nOther revenues also include product sales to and licensing revenue from Nestl\u00e9 related to our Global Coffee Alliance. Product sales to Nestl\u00e9 are generally recognized when the product is shipped whereas royalty revenues are recognized based on a percentage of reported sales.\n\n## Deferred Revenues\n\nOur deferred revenue primarily consists of the up-front prepaid royalty from Nestl\u00e9, for which we have continuing performance obligations to support the Global Coffee Alliance, and our unredeemed stored value card liability and unredeemed Stars associated with our loyalty program. See Note 11, Deferred Revenue, for further information.\n\n## Disaggregation of Revenues\n\nRevenues disaggregated by segment, product type and geographic area are disclosed in Note 17, Segment Reporting.\n\n## Product and Distribution Costs\n\nProduct and distribution costs primarily consist of raw materials, purchased goods and packaging costs as well as operational costs of our supply chain organization, such as wages and benefits, occupancy costs and depreciation expenses, in support of sourcing, procuring, manufacturing, warehousing and transportation activities of products sold at our company-operated and licensed stores as well as through Channel Development and our other businesses. Also included are inventory and supply chain asset impairment costs.\n\n## Store Operating Expenses\n\nStore operating expenses consist of costs incurred in our company-operated stores, primarily wages and benefits related to store partners (employees), occupancy costs and other costs that directly support the operation and sales-related activities of those stores.\n\n## General and Administrative Expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of wages and benefits, professional service fees and occupancy costs for corporate headquarters and regional offices that support our corporate functions, including technology, finance, legal and partner resources.\n\n## Advertising\n\nWe expense most advertising costs as they are incurred, except for certain production costs that are expensed the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expenses totaled $416.7 million, $305.1 million and $258.8 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.",

(1)\n\n## Stored Value Cards and Loyalty Program\n\nThe Starbucks Card, our branded stored value card program, is designed to provide customers with a convenient payment method, support gifting and increase the frequency of store visits by cardholders, in part through the related Starbucks Rewards loyalty program where available, as discussed below. Stored value cards are issued to customers when they initially load them with an account balance. They can be obtained in our company-operated and most licensed stores in North America, China, Japan and many of our markets in our International segment. Stored value cards can also be obtained online, via the Starbucks Mobile App and through other U.S. and international retailers. Customers may access their card balances by utilizing their stored value card or the Starbucks Mobile App in participating stores. In nearly all markets, including the U.S. and Canada, customers who register their Starbucks Cards are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program. Registered members can receive various benefits depending on factors such as the number of reward points ('Stars') earned. In addition to using their Starbucks Cards, Starbucks Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at all company-operated stores and a majority of licensed stores in North America. Using the Mobile Order and Pay functionality of the Starbucks Mobile App, customers can also place orders in advance for pick-up at certain participating locations in several markets. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for further discussion of our stored value cards and loyalty program. \u00ae \u00ae\n\n## Licensed Stores\n\nRevenues from our licensed stores accounted for 11% of total net revenues in fiscal 2022. Licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a margin on branded products and supplies sold to the licensed store operator along with a royalty on retail sales. Licensees are responsible for operating costs and capital investments, which more than offset the lower revenues we receive under the licensed store model.\n\nIn our licensed store operations, we seek to leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience. Licensees provide improved, and at times the only, access to desirable retail space. Most licensees are prominent retailers with in-depth market knowledge and access. As part of these arrangements, we sell coffee, tea, food and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees. We also sell certain equipment, such as coffee brewers and espresso machines, to our licensees for use in their operations. Licensee employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in company-operated stores. In a limited number of international markets, we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores.",

This allows customers to place orders in advance for pick-up at participating locations, which aligns with evolving preferences for mobile ordering and contactless experiences. The app also facilitates access to card balances and loyalty benefits, reinforcing repeat visits and increasing the frequency of store visits by cardholders. These features collectively enhance customer convenience, digital interaction, and loyalty, supporting Starbucks' broader strategy to elevate the customer experience through technology.",

(1)\n\n## Stored Value Cards and Loyalty Program\n\nThe Starbucks Card, our branded stored value card program, is designed to provide customers with a convenient payment method, support gifting and increase the frequency of store visits by cardholders, in part through the related Starbucks Rewards loyalty program where available, as discussed below. Stored value cards are issued to customers when they initially load them with an account balance. They can be obtained in our company-operated and most licensed stores in North America, China, Japan and many of our markets in our International segment. Stored value cards can also be obtained online, via the Starbucks Mobile App and through other U.S. and international retailers. Customers may access their card balances by utilizing their stored value card or the Starbucks Mobile App in participating stores. In nearly all markets, including the U.S. and Canada, customers who register their Starbucks Cards are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program. Registered members can receive various benefits depending on factors such as the number of reward points ('Stars') earned. In addition to using their Starbucks Cards, Starbucks Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at all company-operated stores and a majority of licensed stores in North America. Using the Mobile Order and Pay functionality of the Starbucks Mobile App, customers can also place orders in advance for pick-up at certain participating locations in several markets. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for further discussion of our stored value cards and loyalty program. \u00ae \u00ae\n\n## Licensed Stores\n\nRevenues from our licensed stores accounted for 11% of total net revenues in fiscal 2022. Licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a margin on branded products and supplies sold to the licensed store operator along with a royalty on retail sales. Licensees are responsible for operating costs and capital investments, which more than offset the lower revenues we receive under the licensed store model.\n\nIn our licensed store operations, we seek to leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience. Licensees provide improved, and at times the only, access to desirable retail space. Most licensees are prominent retailers with in-depth market knowledge and access. As part of these arrangements, we sell coffee, tea, food and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees. We also sell certain equipment, such as coffee brewers and espresso machines, to our licensees for use in their operations. Licensee employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in company-operated stores. In a limited number of international markets, we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores.",

In our major international markets, we also continue to invest in technology and establish partnerships with third parties with relevant expertise to increase digital adoption to provide convenience and elevate the customer experience. In China, we leverage platforms such as Starbucks Now stores to enable a seamless integration of physical and digital customer touchpoints. Orders may be placed in advance through the Starbucks Mobile App or Starbucks Delivers and can be conveniently picked up by customers and delivery providers in these express retail format locations. These strategies align closely with rapidly evolving customer preferences, including higher levels of mobile ordering, more contactless pick-up experiences and reduced in-store congestion, all of which naturally allow for greater physical distancing. We announced plans to invest in a digital third place that will offer members access to new benefits, a digital community and immersive coffee experiences, giving our customers new ways to experience and connect with Starbucks. We believe our continued efforts to transform our store portfolio and elevate technology will enhance the customer experience and position Starbucks for long-term growth.

Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. See Item 1A of Part I - 'Risk Factors.' As used herein, 'Amazon.com,' 'we,' 'our,' and similar terms include Amazon.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.\n\n## General\n\nWe seek to be Earth's most customer-centric company. We are guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, content creators, advertisers, and employees.\n\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services ('AWS'). These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. Information on our net sales is contained in Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10 - Segment Information.'\n\n## Consumers\n\nWe serve consumers through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We design our stores to enable hundreds of millions of unique products to be sold by us and by third parties across dozens of product categories. Customers access our offerings through our websites, mobile apps, Alexa, devices, streaming, and physically visiting our stores. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices, including Kindle, Fire tablet, Fire TV, Echo, and Ring, and we develop and produce media content. We seek to offer our customers low prices, fast and free delivery, easy-to-use functionality, and timely customer service. In addition, we offer subscription services such as Amazon Prime, a membership program that includes fast, free shipping on millions of items, access to award-winning movies and series, and other benefits.\n\nWe fulfill customer orders in a number of ways, including through: North America and International fulfillment networks that we operate; co-sourced and outsourced arrangements in certain countries; digital delivery; and through our physical stores. We operate customer service centers globally, which are supplemented by co-sourced arrangements. See Item 2 of Part I, 'Properties.'\n\n## Sellers\n\nWe offer programs that enable sellers to grow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders through us. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. We earn fixed fees, a percentage of sales, per-unit activity fees, interest, or some combination thereof, for our seller programs.\n\n## Developers and Enterprises\n\nWe serve developers and enterprises of all sizes, including start-ups, government agencies, and academic institutions, through AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services.\n\n## Content Creators\n\nWe serve authors and independent publishers with Kindle Direct Publishing, an online service that lets independent authors and publishers choose a royalty option and make their books available in the Kindle Store, along with Amazon's own publishing arm, Amazon Publishing. We also offer programs that allow authors, musicians, filmmakers, Twitch streamers, skill and app developers, and others to publish and sell content.\n\n## Advertisers\n\nWe provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising.",

      "answer": "Amazon's revenue from third-party seller fees in 2022 was $117,757 million. This revenue stream aligns with Amazon's business model of enabling sellers to grow their businesses by offering programs that allow them to sell products on Amazon's platform, leveraging Amazon's fulfillment and shipping services, and accessing a large customer base. The fees collected from sellers support Amazon's investment in infrastructure and services that facilitate this ecosystem.",

See 'Note 10 - Segment Information.'\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc. and its consolidated entities (collectively, the 'Company'), consisting of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and those entities in which we have a variable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in India and certain entities that support our seller lending financing activities. Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives of equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, vendor funding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, and valuation and impairment of investments. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. For example, in Q4 2021 we completed a useful life study for our servers and networking equipment and are increasing the useful lives from four years to five years for servers and from five years to six years for networking equipment in January 2022, which, based on servers and networking equipment that are included in 'Property and equipment, net' as of December 31, 2021, will have an anticipated impact to our 2022 operating income of $3.1 billion. We had previously increased the useful life of our servers from three years to four years in January 2020.\n\n## Supplemental Cash Flow Information\n\nThe following table shows supplemental cash flow information (in millions):\n\n",

However, this positive performance in Lawn & Garden was not enough to offset the overall comparable sales decline of 4.7%, which was primarily due to a 4.6% decline in comparable customer transactions and a 0.1% decline in comparable average ticket across most other product categories.",

      "answer": "Nike's investment in product offering innovation, as stated in its 2023 10-K filing, directly supports the proliferation of technologies like Nike Air Zoom by funding research, design, and development efforts that integrate these innovations into new products across multiple categories. The filing notes that Nike is 'simultaneously focused on the design of innovative products and experiences incorporating such technologies throughout our product categories and consumer applications,' with Nike Air Zoom being one of the highlighted technologies. However, the filing also warns that if 'substantial investments... fail to produce expected returns,' it could have a 'material adverse effect on our financial results.' This indicates that while Nike's investment strategy is critical for advancing technologies like Air Zoom, it also carries significant financial risk if the expected market performance or consumer adoption of these technologies does not materialize.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The proliferation of Nike Air Zoom technology is directly tied to Nike's research, design, and development efforts aimed at integrating such technologies into innovative products across various categories.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Nike's substantial investments in product offering innovation and manufacturing carry risks, as failure to produce expected returns could have a material adverse effect on financial results.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Nike's investment in innovation is essential for advancing technologies like Nike Air Zoom, but this strategy poses financial risk if the expected returns are not realized, as both are explicitly stated in the filing."

      "answer": "The 15% currency-neutral revenue decline in Converse, primarily due to drops in North America and Western Europe, contributed to a 30% decrease in reported EBIT. This was exacerbated by a 130 basis point gross margin contraction caused in part by unfavorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates, which further reduced profitability.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Converse is a reportable segment of Nike and uses standard foreign currency exchange rates for inventory and cost of sales, with differences from actual rates included in Corporate.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Converse revenues decreased by 15% on a currency-neutral basis, mainly due to declines in North America and Western Europe, and EBIT decreased by 30%.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b - Gross margin contracted by approximately 130 basis points, partly due to unfavorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The revenue drop in Converse, especially in key regions, reduced EBIT. The gross margin pressure from foreign exchange rate mismatches added to the EBIT decline, showing a multi-hop causal relationship between regional performance, currency management, and profitability."

      "question": "What percentage of Nike's total revenues came from the APLA region in fiscal 2023, and how does this compare to the region's significance in terms of workforce representation through trade unions?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2023, Nike generated $6,431 million in revenues from the APLA region, which represents 12.56% of Nike's total revenues of $51,217 million. In terms of workforce representation, Nike notes that employees in the EMEA and APLA geographies are members of and/or represented by trade unions, in contrast to most of Nike's global workforce, which is not union-represented. This indicates that APLA holds significance in Nike's labor structure, as it is one of the few regions where union representation plays a notable role, despite contributing a relatively small percentage of overall revenues.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, extract the total revenues from the APLA region in fiscal 2023: $6,431 million.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_a, extract Nike's total revenues for fiscal 2023: $51,217 million.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the percentage contribution of APLA revenues to total revenues: $6,431 / $51,217 = 12.56%.",
        "Step 4: From evidence_source_b, identify that APLA is one of only two global regions (alongside EMEA) where Nike employees are members of and/or represented by trade unions.",
        "Step 5: Synthesize that while APLA contributes a modest share of Nike\u2019s revenues (12.56%), it plays a distinct role in Nike\u2019s labor structure due to the presence of trade union representation, which is otherwise uncommon across Nike\u2019s global workforce."

      "answer": "Tesla's R&D expenses increased by $894 million, or 29%, in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily driven by additional costs related to the preproduction phase for the Cybertruck, despite the vehicle already being in active production at Gigafactory Texas. This indicates that while the Cybertruck had entered production, significant development and preparation costs continued to contribute to R&D spending. Furthermore, the filing notes that R&D expenses increased proportionally with total revenues, suggesting that the Cybertruck's ongoing preproduction costs were a key component of this aligned growth in R&D spending and revenue.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The Cybertruck is listed in the production table under Gigafactory Texas with 'Active' production status.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Tesla's R&D expenses increased by $894 million in 2023, with the filing explicitly stating that this increase was primarily driven by additional costs related to the preproduction phase for the Cybertruck.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Despite the Cybertruck being in active production at Gigafactory Texas, Tesla continued to incur significant preproduction costs that contributed to the $894 million year-over-year R&D increase, even as R&D spending overall rose proportionally with revenue."

      "question": "How does The Home Depot's investment in self-service lockers directly support its operational efficiency in fulfilling store-based online orders, particularly given that 50% of U.S. online orders were fulfilled through stores in fiscal 2023?",
      "answer": "The Home Depot's investment in self-service lockers directly supports its operational efficiency by enabling customers to pick up online orders without requiring associate assistance, reducing wait times and labor costs. Since 50% of U.S. online orders were fulfilled through stores in fiscal 2023, the lockers enhance the scalability of this fulfillment method by providing a convenient, staff-free option at the front entrance of many stores. This aligns with the company\u2019s goal of optimizing order fulfillment and delivery based on customer needs while leveraging its store footprint to maintain a competitive advantage in omnichannel retail.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - 'We also offer... self-service lockers at the front entrance of many of our stores' and 'For fiscal 2023, approximately 50% of our U.S. online orders were fulfilled through a store.'",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - 'self-service lockers, online order storage areas and curbside service to enable convenient online order pickup options.'",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The self-service lockers directly support the fulfillment of online orders through stores, which account for 50% of all U.S. online orders. This investment improves operational efficiency by reducing the need for associate involvement during pickup, aligning with the company\u2019s interconnected retail strategy and competitive advantage."

BUSINESS\n\n## Overview\n\nWe design, develop, manufacture, sell and lease high-performance fully electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems, and offer services related to our products. We generally sell our products directly to customers, including through our website and retail locations. We also continue to grow our customer-facing infrastructure through a global network of vehicle service centers, Mobile Service technicians, body shops, Supercharger stations and Destination Chargers to accelerate the widespread adoption of our products. We emphasize performance, attractive styling and the safety of our users and workforce in the design and manufacture of our products and are continuing to develop full self-driving technology for improved safety. We also strive to lower the cost of ownership for our customers through continuous efforts to reduce manufacturing costs and by offering financial and other services tailored to our products. Our mission to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy, engineering expertise, vertically integrated business model and focus on user experience differentiate us from other companies.\n\n## Segment Information\n\nWe operate as two reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage.\n\nThe automotive segment includes the design, development, manufacturing, sales and leasing of electric vehicles as well as sales of automotive regulatory credits. Additionally, the automotive segment is also comprised of services and other, which includes non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, sales of used vehicles, retail merchandise, sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers and vehicle insurance revenue. The energy generation and storage segment includes the design, manufacture, installation, sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products and related services and sales of solar energy systems incentives.\n\n## Our Products and Services\n\n## Automotive\n\n## Model 3\n\nModel 3 is a four-door mid-size sedan that we designed for manufacturability with a base price for mass-market appeal. We currently manufacture Model 3 at the Fremont Factory and at Gigafactory Shanghai.\n\n## Model Y\n\nModel Y is a compact sport utility vehicle ('SUV') built on the Model 3 platform with seating for up to seven adults. We currently manufacture Model Y at the Fremont Factory and at Gigafactory Shanghai.\n\n## Model S and Model X\n\nModel S is a four-door full-size sedan and Model X is a mid-size SUV with seating for up to seven adults. Model S and Model X feature the highest performance characteristics and longest ranges that we offer in a sedan and SUV, respectively, and we manufacture both models at the Fremont Factory.

      "answer": "According to Tesla's 2022 10-K, the Tesla Semi is listed as 'In development' at a TBD location, while the Tesla Roadster is also listed as 'In development' at another TBD location. This parallel development status suggests that neither the commercial (Semi) nor the consumer (Roadster) vehicles have been prioritized for immediate production. However, since both are at TBD locations and not yet tied to specific production facilities like Gigafactory Texas (which is already hosting Cybertruck development), it indicates Tesla is cautiously balancing its long-term product roadmap while focusing near-term production capacity on vehicles further along in development, such as the Cybertruck.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, we learn that Tesla has announced both the Tesla Semi (a commercial electric vehicle) and the Tesla Roadster (a consumer electric vehicle) as part of its future product roadmap.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, we extract the specific development statuses: Tesla Semi is listed as 'In development' at a TBD location, and Tesla Roadster is also listed as 'In development' at a TBD location.",
        "Step 3: We compare the development stages of both vehicles and note that neither has been assigned to an active or equipment test phase facility like Gigafactory Texas, which is already hosting Cybertruck development.",
        "Step 4: Synthesizing both chunks, we infer Tesla is not currently prioritizing either the Semi or Roadster for near-term production, suggesting a strategic balance between commercial and consumer vehicle development timelines."

      "question": "How does the structure of Tesla's 5.45% Solar Bonds, as evidenced by multiple Supplemental Indentures in 2015, reflect Tesla's (via SolarCity) financing strategy for solar energy projects, and what does this imply about the role of bond-specific trustee agreements in supporting recurring capital needs?",
      "answer": "Tesla, through its acquisition of SolarCity, issued multiple tranches of 5.45% Solar Bonds in 2015 (Series 2015/C122-15, 2015/C127-15, 2015/C132-15, and 2015/C137-15), each governed by distinct Supplemental Indentures (4.72, 4.74, 4.76, and 4.78) dated at different points in November through December 2015. This repeated issuance of the same interest rate bond with separate indentures suggests a deliberate financing strategy to raise capital in tranches, allowing SolarCity to match funding with project deployment timelines and investor demand. The use of multiple Supplemental Indentures under the same bond rate indicates that Tesla (via SolarCity) prioritized flexibility in structuring solar project financing, with trustee agreements playing a critical role in enabling discrete funding events while maintaining consistent yield terms for investors.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Identify the multiple tranches of 5.45% Solar Bonds issued by SolarCity in 2015 (Series C122-15, C127-15, C132-15, C137-15) and their associated Supplemental Indentures (4.72, 4.74, 4.76, 4.78) dated November to December 2015.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Confirm the presence and consistency of the same bond series and indenture structure across the same filing, reinforcing that the issuance pattern was intentional and part of a broader documented capital strategy.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The repeated use of 5.45% as the coupon rate across multiple bond series, each with its own Supplemental Indenture, indicates that SolarCity (and subsequently Tesla) was deploying a phased capital-raising strategy, likely aligned with solar project deployment cycles and investor appetite. The indentures provided the legal framework for each discrete issuance while maintaining consistent return expectations for bondholders."

      "answer": "Amazon's decision to enter into an $8.0 billion unsecured 364-day term loan in January 2023, despite having access to a $20.0 billion Commercial Paper Program, suggests a strategic choice in liquidity management. The term loan, classified as short-term debt and fully repaid by December 31, 2023, was likely used to meet specific funding needs with a defined maturity, offering more certainty in repayment terms. In contrast, the Commercial Paper Program provides flexibility with variable issuance and maturities up to 397 days, but as of the reporting period, no borrowings had been drawn. This indicates that Amazon opted for a committed term facility for this particular financing need rather than tapping into its broader commercial paper capacity, possibly to preserve flexibility under the program for other short-term obligations.",

Net sales and related expenses generated from our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from ex pectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales decreased by $1.8 billion in comparison with the prior year.\n\nWe have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities ('foreign funds'). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of December 31, 2024, of $25.5 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in declines of $1.3 billion, $2.6 billion, and $5.1 billion.\n\nWe also have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of December 31, 2024, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange rates would result in losses of $305 million, $605 million, and $1.2 billion, recorded to 'Other income (expense), net.'\n\nSee Item 7 of Part II, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations - Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates' for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates.\n\n## Equity Investment Risk\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, our recorded value in equity, equity warrant, and convertible debt investments in public and private companies was $22.1 billion. Our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies, which include our equity investment in Rivian, represent $4.6 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2024, and are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. We record our equity warrant investments in private companies at fair value and adjust our equity investments in private companies for observable price changes or impairments. We record our available-for-sale convertible debt investments in private companies at fair value, which primarily relate to Anthropic, PBC. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. The current global economic conditions provide additional uncertainty. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable. See Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures' for additional information.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Other Assets\n\nIncluded in 'Other assets' on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to video and music content, net of accumulated amortization; long-term deferred tax assets; acquired intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization; convertible notes and certain equity investments; satellite network launch services deposits; and affordable housing loans. We recognize certain transactions with governments when there is reasonable assurance that incentives included in the agreements, such as cash or certain tax credits, will be received and we are able to comply with any related conditions. These incentives are recorded as reductions to the cost of related assets or ex penses.\n\n## Digital Video and Music Content\n\nWe obtain video content, inclusive of episodic television and movies, and music content for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment schedules. When the license fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us, we recognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We reduce the liability as payments are made and we amortize the asset to 'Cost of sales' on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage or viewing patterns, or on a straight-line basis. If the licensing fee is not determinable or reasonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are ex pensed as incurred. We also develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to 'Cost of sales' predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the estimated viewing patterns associated with the content. The weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 3.1 years. We review usage and viewing patterns impacting the amortization of capitalized video content on an ongoing basis and reflect any changes prospectively.\n\nOur produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group, in each major geography where we offer Amazon Prime memberships. These film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the fair value is less than the carrying value. The total capitalized costs of video, which is primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2023 and 2024 were $17.4 billion and $19.6 billion. Total video and music expense was $18.9 billion and $20.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2024. Total video and music expense includes licensing and production costs associated with content offered within Amazon Prime memberships, and costs associated with digital subscriptions and sold or rented content.\n\n## Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\n\nWe generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term marketable debt securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Such investments are included in 'Cash and cash equivalents' or 'Marketable securities' on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\n\nMarketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in 'Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).' Each reporting period, we evaluate whether declines in fair value below carrying value are due to expected credit losses, as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs. Ex pected credit losses are recorded as an allowance through 'Other income (expense), net' on our consolidated statements of operations.\n\nEquity investments that have readily determinable fair values, including investments for which we have elected the fair value option, are included in 'Marketable securities' on our consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value with changes recognized in 'Other income (expense), net' on our consolidated statements of operations.\n\n## Non-Marketable Investments\n\nNotes that are convertible to equity classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in 'Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).' Credit losses, if any, are recorded as an allowance through 'Other income (expense), net' on our consolidated statements of operations. Upon conversion, the amount of the notes reported at fair value are reclassified generally from available-for-sale to equity investments accounted for at cost, with any associated unrealized gain or loss reclassified from 'Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)' to 'Other income (expense), net' on our consolidated statements of operations.\n\nIn Q3 2023, we invested in a $1.25 billion note from Anthropic, PBC, which is convertible to equity. In Q1 2024, we invested $2.75 billion in a second convertible note. In Q4 2024, we entered into an agreement and invested $1.3 billion in a third convertible note, and will invest an additional $2.7 billion by Q4 2025. The notes are classified as available-for-sale and are classified as Level 3 assets, and as of December 31, 2024 had an estimated fair value of approx imately $13.8 billion. In making these estimates, we utilized valuation methods based on information available, including the rights and obligations of the convertible notes, other outstanding classes of securities, observable transactions such as new securities offerings, estimates of expected time to and type of liquidity events and anticipated securities offerings, and discounts for lack of marketability. Subsequent to December 31, 2024, a portion of the notes were converted to nonvoting preferred stock. As a result of this conversion, a significant portion of the unrealized gain associated with the notes as of December 31, 2024 was reclassified and",

As used herein, 'Amazon.com,' 'we,' 'our,' and similar terms include Amazon.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.\n\n## General\n\nWe seek to be Earth's most customer-centric company. We are guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, content creators, advertisers, and employees.\n\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services ('AWS'). These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. Information on our net sales is contained in Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10 - Segment Information.'\n\n## Consumers\n\nWe serve consumers through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We design our stores to enable hundreds of millions of unique products to be sold by us and by third parties across dozens of product categories. Customers access our offerings through our websites, mobile apps, Alexa, devices, streaming, and physically visiting our stores. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices, including Kindle, Fire tablet, Fire TV, Echo, Ring, Blink, and eero, and we develop and produce media content. We seek to offer our customers low prices, fast and free delivery, easy-to-use functionality, and timely customer service. In addition, we offer subscription services such as Amazon Prime, a membership program that includes fast, free shipping on tens of millions of items, access to award-winning movies and series, live sports, and other benefits.\n\nWe fulfill customer orders in a number of ways, including through: North America and International fulfillment networks that we operate; co-sourced and outsourced arrangements in certain countries; digital delivery; and through our physical stores. We operate customer service centers globally, which are supplemented by co-sourced arrangements. See Item 2 of Part I, 'Properties.'\n\n## Sellers\n\nWe offer programs that enable sellers to grow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders using our services. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. We earn fixed fees, a percentage of sales, per-unit activity fees, interest, or some combination thereof, for our seller programs.\n\n## Developers and E nterprises\n\nWe serve developers and enterprises of all sizes, including start-ups, government agencies, and academic institutions, through AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services.\n\n## Content Creators\n\nWe offer programs that allow authors, independent publishers, musicians, filmmakers, Twitch streamers, skill and app developers, and others to publish and sell content.\n\n## Advertisers\n\nWe provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising.",

      "answer": "The $596 million of FSD (Supervised) revenue recognized in 2024 offset approximately 9.9% of the $6.03 billion decline in Automotive Sales Revenue ($596M \u00f7 $6,030M = 0.0988 or 9.9%). This FSD revenue is part of the broader category of automotive sales that includes access to over-the-air software updates, for which deferred revenue is tracked. Additionally, Tesla\u2019s maximum exposure for resale value guarantees under leasing programs, which can be affected by residual values influenced by software features like over-the-air updates, increased to $1.45 billion in 2024, up from $166 million in 2023.",
