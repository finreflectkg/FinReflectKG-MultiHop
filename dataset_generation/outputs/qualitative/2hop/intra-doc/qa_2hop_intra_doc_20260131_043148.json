      "answer": "NEE's noncontrolling interest investment in XPLR OpCo totaled $3,315 million as of December 31, 2024. XPLR OpCo is classified as a variable interest entity (VIE) in which NEE is not the primary beneficiary due to lack of control over significant activities and absence of a controlling financial interest, and therefore it is accounted for under the equity method.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - NEE's investment in entities accounted for under the equity method, including its noncontrolling interest in XPLR OpCo, totaled approximately $3,315 million at December 31, 2024.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - XPLR OpCo is explicitly defined as 'XPLR Infrastructure Operating Partners, LP (formerly known as NextEra Energy Operating Partners, LP)', a specific entity within the broader XPLR structure.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The question requires both the specific dollar amount tied to NEE's investment in XPLR OpCo (from evidence_source_a) and the explicit identification of XPLR OpCo as a distinct entity (from evidence_source_b) to fully answer both the quantitative and classification components."

A t December 31, 2024 and 2023, the assets and liabilities of these V IEs consisted primarily of property , plant and equipment and accounts payable.\n\nOther - A t December 31, 2024 and 2023, several NEE subsidiaries had investments totaling approximately $5,848 million ($4,506 million at FPL) and $4,962 million ($3,899 million at FPL), respectively , which are included in special use funds and noncurrent other assets on NEE's consolidated balance sheets and in special use funds on FPL's consolidated balance sheets. These investments represented primarily commingled funds and asset-backed securities. NEE subsidiaries, including FPL, are not the primary beneficiaries and therefore do not consolidate any of these entities because they do not control any of the ongoing activities of these entities, were not inv olv ed in the initial design of these entities and do not hav e a controlling financial interest in these entities.\n\nCertain subsidiaries of NEE have noncontrolling interests in entities accounted for under the equity method, including NEE's noncontrolling interest in X PLR OpCo (see Note 8). These entities are limited partnerships or similar entity structures in which the limited partners or non-managing members do not have substantive rights over the significant activities of these entities, and therefore are considered V IEs. NEE is not the primary beneficiary because it does not have a controlling financial interest in these entities, and therefore does not consolidate any of these entities. NEE's investment in these entities totaled approximately $3,315 million and $3,913 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively . A t December 31, 2024, subsidiaries of NEE had guarantees related to certain obligations of one of these entities, as well as commitments to invest an additional approximately $175 million in several of these entities. See further discussion of such guarantees and commitments in Note 15 - Commitments and - Contracts, respectively.\n\n## 10. Leases\n\nNEE has operating and finance leases primarily related to land use agreements that convey exclusive use of the land during the arrangement for certain of its renewable energy projects and substations, as well as buildings and equipment. Operating and finance leases primarily have fixed payments with expected expiration dates ranging from 2025 to 2083, with the exception of operating leases related to three land use agreements with an expiration date of 2106, some of which include options to extend the leases up to 34 years and some have options to terminate at NEE's discretion. A t December 31, 2024, NEE's ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases totaled approximately $372 million and $387 million, respectively; the respective amounts at December 31, 2023 were $396 million and $412 million. A t December 31, 2024, NEE's ROU assets and lease liabilities for finance leases totaled approximately $826 million and $840 million, respectively; the respective amounts at December 31, 2023 were $440 million and $444 million. NEE's lease liabilities at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were calculated using a weighted-average incremental borrowing rate at the lease inception of 3.83% and 3.96%, respectively , for operating leases and 4.92% and 4.32%, respectively , for finance leases, and a weighted-average remaining lease term of 44 years and 44 years, respectively , for operating leases and 33 years and 32 years, respectively , for finance leases. A t December 31, 2024, expected lease payments over the remaining terms of the leases were approximately $2.6 billion with no one year being material. Operating and finance lease-related amounts were not material to NEE's consolidated statements of income or cash flows for the periods presented.\n\nNEE has operating and sales-type leases primarily related to certain battery storage facilities and a natural gas and oil electric generation facility that sell their electric output under power sales agreements to third parties which provide the customers the ability to dispatch the facilities. A t December 31, 2024, the power sales agreements have expiration dates from 2026 to 2044 and NEE expects to receive approximately $3.9 billion of lease payments over the remaining terms of the  power  sales  agreements  with  no  one  year  being  material.  Operating  and  sales-type  lease-related  amounts  were  not  material  to  NEE's  consolidated statements of income or balance sheets for the periods presented.\n\n## 11. Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nNEE's AROs relate primarily to decommissioning obligations of FPL's and NEER's nuclear units and to obligations for the dismantlement of certain of NEER's wind and solar facilities. For NEE's rate-regulated operations, including FPL, the accounting provisions result in timing differences in the recognition of legal asset  retirement  costs  for  financial  reporting  purposes  and  the  method  the  regulator  allows  for  recovery  in  rates.  See  Note  1  -  Rate  Regulation  and  Decommissioning of Nuclear Plants, Dismantlement of Plants and Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs.",

      "question": "How does NEE's limited partner interest in XPLR OpCo potentially impact its financial obligations and liquidity, particularly if XPLR is unable to access capital on commercially reasonable terms?",
      "answer": "NEE's limited partner interest in XPLR OpCo could negatively affect its liquidity and financial obligations if XPLR is unable to access capital on commercially reasonable terms. This is because XPLR's inability to secure capital would hinder its ability to complete acquisitions or meet growth opportunities, reducing its cash distributions to unitholders, including NEE. Additionally, if XPLR issues more common units or converts existing securities into common units, NEE's share of future distributions could be diluted. This directly impacts NEE\u2019s cash flows, which are crucial for meeting its financial obligations and paying dividends.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - NEE holds a limited partner interest in XPLR OpCo through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary, and XPLR's inability to access capital could materially affect NEE's cash distributions and the value of its investment.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - XPLR OpCo is explicitly defined as 'XPLR Infrastructure Operating Partners, LP,' confirming the nature of the entity in which NEE holds a stake.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - If XPLR cannot access capital, it may not generate sufficient cash distributions to its unitholders, including NEE. Since NEE relies on its subsidiaries and investments for cash flows to meet its obligations and pay dividends, this risk directly affects NEE\u2019s liquidity and financial condition."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Certain of NEE 's assets and investments are subject to changes in market value and other risks, which may materially adversely affect NEE 's liquidity , financial condition and results of operations.\n\nNEE holds certain assets and investments where changes in the fair value affect NEE's financial results. In some cases there may be no observable market values for these assets and investments, requiring fair value estimates to be based on other valuation techniques. This type of analysis requires significant judgment and the actual values realized in a sale of these assets and investments could differ materially from those estimated. A  sale of an asset or investment below previously estimated value, or other decline in the fair value of an asset or investment, could result in losses or the write-off of such asset or investment, and may have a material adverse effect on NEE's liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nNEE has invested in various joint ventures and equity method investments where it does not have full control over operations, management or decision-making. In many cases, NEE shares control rights with its partners, but may lack influence or be dependent on their business priorities. This situation can lead to decisions that differ from NEE's preferences, potentially impacting the profitability and value of these investments. Furthermore, if a joint venture partner becomes insolvent or bankrupt or is otherwise unable to meet its obligations, NEE may be responsible for meeting certain obligations of the joint ventures as stipulated in its governing documents or applicable law. NEE's reliance on the joint venture partners, who may not always share NEE's business priorities, may have a material adverse effect on NEE's liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## NEE may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay upstream dividends or repay funds to NEE.\n\nNEE is a holding company and, as such, has no material operations of its own. Substantially all of NEE's consolidated assets are held by its subsidiaries. NEE's ability  to meet its financial obligations, including, but not limited to, its guarantees, and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on its subsidiaries' net income and cash flows, which are subject to the risks of their respective businesses, and their ability to pay upstream dividends or to repay funds to NEE.\n\nNEE's subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no independent obligation to provide NEE with funds for its payment obligations. The subsidiaries have financial obligations, including, but not limited to, payment of debt service, which they must satisfy before they can provide NEE with funds. In addition, in the event of a subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization, NEE's right to participate in a distribution of assets is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary's creditors.\n\nThe dividend-paying ability of some of the subsidiaries is limited by contractual restrictions which are contained in outstanding financing agreements and which may be included in future financing agreements. The future enactment of laws or regulations also may prohibit or restrict the ability of NEE's subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends or to repay funds.\n\n## NEE may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if NEE  is required to perform under guarantees of obligations of its subsidiaries.\n\nNEE guarantees many of the obligations of its consolidated subsidiaries, other than FPL, through guarantee agreements with NEECH. These guarantees may require NEE to provide substantial funds to its subsidiaries or their creditors or counterparties at a time when NEE is in need of liquidity to meet its own financial obligations. Funding such guarantees may materially adversely affect NEE's ability to meet its financial obligations or to pay dividends.\n\nXPLR may not be able to access sources of capital on commercially reasonable terms, which would have a material adverse effect on its ability to consummate future acquisitions and on the value of NEE's limited partner interest in XPLR OpCo.\n\nThrough an indirect wholly owned subsidiary , NEE owns a limited partner interest in X PLR OpCo. X PLR's inability to access capital on commercially reasonable terms when acquisitions, other growth opportunities or capital needs arise could have a material adverse effect on X PLR's ability to deliver its cash distributions to its common unitholders in the future, including NEE, and on the value of NEE's limited partnership interest in X PLR OpCo. In addition, X PLR's issuance of additional common units or other securities in connection with acquisitions or the conversion of outstanding securities convertible into X PLR common units could cause significant common unitholder dilution and reduce future cash distributions, if any, to its common unitholders, including NEE.\n\n## Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit and capital markets may exert downward pressure on the market price of NE E 's common stock.\n\nThe market price and trading volume of NEE's common stock are subject to fluctuations as a result of, among other factors, general credit and capital market conditions and changes in market sentiment regarding the operations, business and financing strategies of NEE, its subsidiaries and its affiliates. A s a result, disruptions, uncertainty or volatility  in the credit and capital markets may, for ex ample, have a material adverse effect on the market price of NEE's common stock.",

      "question": "What operational risks does NextEra Energy Resources face given the mismatch between the Duane Arnold decommissioning timeline (expected completion by 2080) and the expiration dates of its nuclear fuel supply contracts (through 2033)?",
      "answer": "NextEra Energy Resources faces the risk of managing nuclear fuel supply beyond the expiration of existing contracts in 2033 while maintaining safe and compliant decommissioning operations at Duane Arnold, which is expected to continue through 2080. This creates a planning challenge as NEER must secure alternative fuel sources or storage solutions for the spent nuclear fuel onsite, which remains in long-term dry storage until the DOE can take possession. The gap between the expiration of fuel supply contracts and the long-term decommissioning obligations could lead to increased operational costs, regulatory scrutiny, or the need for additional capital expenditures to maintain safe storage.",

License renew als are pending.\n\nNEER is responsible for all nuclear unit operations and the ultimate decommissioning of the nuclear units, the cost of which is shared on a pro-rata basis by the joint owners with respect to the Seabrook unit. NRC regulations require plant owners to submit a plan for decontamination and decommissioning five years before the projected end of plant operation. NEER's nuclear facilities use both on-site storage pools and dry storage casks to store spent nuclear fuel generated by these facilities, which, based on existing regulations, are expected to provide sufficient storage of spent nuclear fuel that is generated at these facilities through current license expiration, as well as through any pending license extensions.\n\nNEER also maintains an approximately 70% interest in Duane A rnold, a nuclear facility located in Iowa that ceased operations in A ugust 2020. NEER has a sitespecific cost estimate and plan for decontamination and decommissioning on file with the NRC. A ll spent nuclear fuel housed onsite is in long-term dry storage until the DOE is able to take possession. In January 2025, NEER submitted a licensing path and exemption request with the NRC to explore the potential to recommission Duane Arnold. A  recommissioning of Duane A rnold is contingent upon several factors including receipt of NRC regulatory approvals and approval of subsequent license renewal. In the event that Duane A rnold is not recommissioned, NEER estimates that the cost of decommissioning Duane A rnold is fully funded and would expect completion by approximately 2080.\n\n## Other Clean Energy\n\nNEER's portfolio also includes assets and investments in other businesses with a clean energy focus, such as battery storage, natural gas pipelines and renewable fuels. A t December 31, 2024, NextEra Energy Resources had net ownership interests in approximately 3,379  M W  of  battery  storage  capacity . In addition,  NextEra  Energy  Resources  has  equity  method  investments  in  four  natural  gas  pipelines  located  in  the  Southeast  region  of  the  U.S.,  which  total approximately 1,052 miles of pipeline. NextEra Energy Resources' net ownership interests represent noncontrolling interests ranging from approximately 33.3% to 85.0% in the pipelines and total net capacity of 1.67 Bcf per day . NextEra Energy Resources owns, or has a partial ownership interest in, a portfolio of 29 biogas projects, one of which is an operating renewable natural gas facility and the others of which are primarily operating landfill gas-to-electric facilities.\n\n## Policy Incentives for Clean Energy Projects\n\nU.S. federal, state and local governments have established various incentives to support the development of clean energy projects. These incentives include accelerated tax depreciation, PTCs, ITCs, cash grants, tax abatements and RPS programs. Pursuant to the U.S. federal M odified A ccelerated Cost Recovery System, wind and solar generation facilities are depreciated for tax purposes over a five-year period even though the useful life of such facilities is generally much longer than five years.\n\nOwners of wind and solar facilities are eligible to claim an income tax credit (the PTC, or an ITC in lieu of the PTC) upon initially achieving commercial operation. Wind and solar generation facilities are eligible for 100% PTC or 30% ITC if such facilities start construction before the later of 2034 or the end of the calendar year following the year in which greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. electric generation are reduced by 75% from 2022 levels. The PTC is determined based on the amount of electricity produced by the facility during the first ten y ears of commercial operation. A  facility  must also meet certain labor requirements to qualify for the 100% PTC or 30% ITC rate or construction must have started on the facility before January 29, 2023. In addition, the PTC is increased by 10% and the ITC rate is increased by 10 percentage points for facilities that satisfy certain tax credit enhancement requirements. Retrofitted wind and solar generation facilities may qualify for a PTC or an ITC if the cost basis of the new investment is at least 80% of the retrofitted facility's total fair v alue.\n\nIn addition, the 30% ITC applies to energy storage projects placed in service after 2022 (previously , such projects qualified only if they were connected to and charged by a renewable generation facility that claimed the ITC) as well as certain property with respect to renewable natural gas facilities (including gas upgrading equipment) that are placed in service after 2022 and began construction before 2025. Energy storage projects and renewable natural gas facilities are eligible for a 10 percentage point increase in the ITC rate if the facilities satisfy  certain tax  credit enhancement requirements.",

          "chunk_text": "\nThe NRC has acknowledged permanent cessation of operation and permanent removal of fuel from the reactor vessel at Crystal River Unit 3. Therefore, the license no longer authorizes operation of the reactor. During 2019, Duke Energy Florida entered into an agreement for the accelerated decommissioning of Crystal River Unit 3. Regulatory approval was received from the NRC and the FPSC in April 2020 and August 2020, respectively. See Note 3 for more information.\n\n## Closure of Ash Impoundments\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are subject to state and federal regulations covering the closure of coal ash impoundments, including the EPA CCR rule and the Coal Ash Act, and other agreements. AROs recorded on the Duke Energy Registrants' Consolidated Balance Sheets include the legal obligation for closure of coal ash basins and the disposal of related ash as a result of these regulations and agreements.\n\nThe ARO amount recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets is based upon estimated closure costs for impacted ash impoundments. The amount recorded represents the discounted cash flows for estimated closure costs based upon specific closure plans. Actual costs to be incurred will be dependent upon factors that vary from site to site. The most significant factors are the method and time frame of closure at the individual sites. Closure methods considered include removing the water from ash basins, consolidating material as necessary and capping the ash with a synthetic barrier, excavating and relocating the ash to a lined structural fill or lined landfill or recycling the ash for concrete or some other beneficial use. The ultimate method and timetable for closure will be in compliance with standards set by federal and state regulations and other agreements. The ARO amount will be adjusted as additional information is gained through the closure and post-closure process, including acceptance and approval of compliance approaches, which may change management assumptions, and may result in a material change to the balance. See ARO Liability Rollforward section below for information on revisions made to the coal ash liability during 2021 and 2020.\n\nAsset retirement costs associated with the AROs for operating plants and retired plants are included in Net property, plant and equipment and Regulatory assets, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 3 for additional information on Regulatory assets related to AROs and Note 4 for additional information on commitments and contingencies.\n\nCost recovery for future expenditures will be pursued through the normal ratemaking process with federal and state utility commissions, which permit recovery of necessary and prudently incurred costs associated with Duke Energy's regulated operations. See Note 3 for additional information on recovery of coal ash costs.",

As of December 31, 2021, the inventory balance for Electric Utilities and Infrastructure was approximately $3 billion. For additional information on inventory, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.'\n\n## Ash Basin Management\n\nDuring 2015, EPA issued regulations related to the management of CCR from power plants. These regulations classify CCR as nonhazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and apply to electric generating sites with new and existing landfills and new and existing surface impoundments and establish requirements regarding landfill design, structural integrity design and assessment criteria for surface impoundments, groundwater monitoring, protection and remedial procedures and other operational and reporting procedures for the disposal and management of CCR. In addition to the federal regulations, CCR landfills and surface impoundments (ash basins or impoundments) will continue to be regulated by existing state laws, regulations and permits, such as the North Carolina Coal Ash Management Act of 2014 (Coal Ash Act).\n\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure has and will periodically submit to applicable authorities required site-specific coal ash impoundment remediation or closure plans. Closure plans must be approved and all associated permits issued before any work can begin. Closure activities have begun in all of Duke Energy's jurisdictions. Excavation began in 2015 at the four sites specified as high priority by the Coal Ash Act and at the W.S. Lee Steam Station site in South Carolina in connection with other legal requirements. Excavation at these sites involves movement of CCR materials to appropriate engineered off-site or on-site lined landfills or for reuse in an approved beneficial application. Duke Energy has completed excavation of coal ash at three of the four high-priority North Carolina sites. At other sites where CCR management is required, planning and closure methods have been studied and factored into the estimated retirement and management costs, and closure activities have commenced.\n\nThe EPA CCR rule and the Coal Ash Act leave the decision on cost recovery determinations related to closure of coal ash surface impoundments to the normal ratemaking processes before utility regulatory commissions. Duke Energy's electric utilities have included compliance costs associated with federal and state requirements in their respective rate proceedings. During 2017, Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress' wholesale contracts were amended to include the recovery of expenditures related to AROs for the closure of coal ash basins. The amended contracts have retail disallowance parity or provisions limiting challenges to CCR cost recovery actions at FERC. FERC approved the amended wholesale rate schedules in 2017. For additional information on the ash basins and recovery, see Item 7, \"Other Matters\" and Notes 3, 4 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" \"Commitments and Contingencies\" and \"Asset Retirement Obligations,\" respectively.\n\n## Nuclear Matters\n\nDuke Energy owns, wholly or partially, 11 operating nuclear reactors located at six operating stations. The Crystal River Unit 3 permanently ceased operation in February 2013. Nuclear insurance includes: nuclear liability coverage; property damage coverage; nuclear accident decontamination and premature decommissioning coverage; and accidental outage coverage for losses in the event of a major accidental outage. Joint owners reimburse Duke Energy for certain expenses associated with nuclear insurance in accordance with joint owner agreements. The Price-Anderson Act requires plant owners to provide for public nuclear liability claims resulting from nuclear incidents to the maximum total financial protection liability, which is approximately $13.5 billion. For additional information on nuclear insurance, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 'Commitments and Contingencies.'\n\nDuke Energy has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decommission and decontaminate each plant safely. The NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC require Duke Energy to update their cost estimates for decommissioning their nuclear plants every five years.\n\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of NDTF investments and the most recent site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost studies. Decommissioning costs are stated in 2018 or 2019 dollars, depending on the year of the cost study, and include costs to decommission plant components not subject to radioactive contamination.\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Coal Ash Act\n\nAROs recorded on the Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, include the legal obligation for closure of coal ash basins and the disposal of related ash as a result of the Coal Ash Act, the EPA CCR rule and other agreements. The Coal Ash Act includes a variance procedure for compliance deadlines and other issues surrounding the management of CCR and CCR surface impoundments and prohibits cost recovery in customer rates for unlawful discharge of ash impoundment waters occurring after January 1, 2014. The Coal Ash Act leaves the decision on cost recovery determinations related to closure of ash impoundments to the normal ratemaking processes before utility regulatory commissions.\n\nConsistent with the requirements of the Coal Ash Act, Duke Energy previously submitted comprehensive site assessments and groundwater corrective action plans to NCDEQ. In addition, on December 31, 2019, Duke Energy submitted updated groundwater corrective action plans and sitespecific coal ash impoundment closure plans to NCDEQ.\n\nOn April 1, 2019, NCDEQ issued a closure determination requiring Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress to excavate all remaining coal ash impoundments at the Allen, Belews Creek, Rogers, Marshall, Mayo and Roxboro facilities in North Carolina. On April 26, 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed Petitions for Contested Case Hearings in the Office of Administrative Hearings to challenge NCDEQ's April 1 Order. On December 31, 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress entered into a settlement agreement with NCDEQ and certain community groups under which Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress agreed to excavate seven of the nine remaining coal ash basins at these sites with ash moved to on-site lined landfills, including two at Allen, one at Belews Creek, one at Mayo, one at Roxboro, and two at Rogers. At the two remaining basins at Marshall and Roxboro, uncapped basin ash will be excavated and moved to lined landfills. Those portions of the basins at Marshall and Roxboro, which were previously filled with ash and on which permitted facilities were constructed, will not be disturbed and will be closed pursuant to other state regulations.\n\nFollowing NCDEQ's April 1 Order, Duke Energy estimated the incremental undiscounted cost to close the nine remaining impoundments by excavation would be approximately $4 billion to $5 billion, potentially increasing the total estimated costs to permanently close all ash basins in North Carolina and South Carolina to $9.5 billion to $10.5 billion. The settlement lowers the estimated total undiscounted cost to close the nine remaining basins by excavation by approximately $1.5 billion as compared to Duke Energy's original estimate that followed the order. As a result, the estimated total cost to permanently close all ash basins in North Carolina and South Carolina is approximately $8 billion to $9 billion of which approximately $3.1 billion has been spent through 2021. The majority of the remaining spend is expected to occur over the next 15 to 20 years.\n\nDuke Energy has completed excavation of all coal ash at the Riverbend, Dan River and Sutton plants.\n\nFor further information on ash basins and recovery, see Notes 3 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and 'Asset Retirement Obligations,' respectively.\n\n## North Carolina House Bill 951\n\nOn October 13, 2021, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper signed into law legislation passed by the North Carolina House of Representatives and Senate (the 'Legislation'). This Legislation establishes a framework overseen by the NCUC to advance state CO  emissions reductions through the use of least cost planning while providing for continued reliability and affordable rates for customers served by such generation. It also authorizes the use of performance-based regulation in North Carolina. Among other things, the Legislation requires the NCUC to: 2\n\n- develop an initial carbon plan that would target a 70% reduction in CO  emissions from public utilities' electric generation in the state by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050, considering all resource options and the latest technology; 2\n- adopt rules to implement the requirements of the Legislation authorizing performance-based regulation that includes multiyear rate plans with a maximum three-year term, performance incentive mechanisms to track utility performance, and revenue decoupling for the residential customer class;\n- establish rules to securitize costs associated with the early retirement of subcritical coal-fired electric generating facilities necessary to achieve the authorized carbon reduction goals at 50% of remaining net book value, with the remaining net book value recovered through normal cost of service basis; and\n- initiate a process for updating rates and terms of certain existing solar power purchase agreements executed under PURPA.\n\n## Other Environmental Regulations\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are also subject to various federal, state and local laws regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal and other environmental matters. Duke Energy continues to comply with enacted environmental statutes and regulations even as certain of these regulations are in various stages of clarification, revision or legal challenge. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the outcome of these matters.\n\n## Global Climate Change and Regulation of GHG Emissions\n\nIn 2021, President Biden recommitted the United States to the Paris Agreement and announced a new target for the United States of 50% - 52% reduction in economywide net GHG emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. The U.S. submittal to support this Paris target includes a goal for 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. These actions have been supplemented by a number of executive orders by President Biden and an indication by a number of regulatory agencies, including the EPA, that they would impose additional regulations on CO  and methane emissions to which Duke Energy will be subject. The Duke Energy Registrants are monitoring these matters and cannot predict the outcome, however, there could be a material impact on our climate strategy. 2",

Duke Energy has completed excavation of coal ash at three of the four high-priority North Carolina sites. At other sites where CCR management is required, planning and closure methods have been studied and factored into the estimated retirement and management costs, and closure activities have commenced.\n\nThe EPA CCR rule and the Coal Ash Act leave the decision on cost recovery determinations related to closure of coal ash surface impoundments to the normal ratemaking processes before utility regulatory commissions. Duke Energy's electric utilities have included compliance costs associated with federal and state requirements in their respective rate proceedings. During 2017, Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress' wholesale contracts were amended to include the recovery of expenditures related to AROs for the closure of coal ash basins. The amended contracts have retail disallowance parity or provisions limiting challenges to CCR cost recovery actions at FERC. FERC approved the amended wholesale rate schedules in 2017. For additional information on the ash basins and recovery, see Item 7, \"Other Matters\" and Notes 3, 4 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" \"Commitments and Contingencies\" and \"Asset Retirement Obligations,\" respectively.\n\n## Nuclear Matters\n\nDuke Energy owns, wholly or partially, 11 operating nuclear reactors located at six operating stations. The Crystal River Unit 3 permanently ceased operation in February 2013. Nuclear insurance includes: nuclear liability coverage; property damage coverage; nuclear accident decontamination and premature decommissioning coverage; and accidental outage coverage for losses in the event of a major accidental outage. Joint owners reimburse Duke Energy for certain expenses associated with nuclear insurance in accordance with joint owner agreements. The Price-Anderson Act requires plant owners to provide for public nuclear liability claims resulting from nuclear incidents to the maximum total financial protection liability, which is approximately $13.5 billion. For additional information on nuclear insurance, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 'Commitments and Contingencies.'\n\nDuke Energy has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decommission and decontaminate each plant safely. The NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC require Duke Energy to update their cost estimates for decommissioning their nuclear plants every five years.\n\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of NDTF investments and the most recent site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost studies. Decommissioning costs are stated in 2018 or 2019 dollars, depending on the year of the cost study, and include costs to decommission plant components not subject to radioactive contamination.\n\n",

      "question": "How does Duke Energy's compliance with the North Carolina Coal Ash Management Act of 2014, as referenced in both the glossary and the business section, impact its operational costs and closure activities at coal ash impoundments?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy's compliance with the North Carolina Coal Ash Management Act of 2014 directly impacts its operational costs and closure activities at coal ash impoundments. According to the business section, Duke Energy has completed excavation of coal ash at three of the four high-priority North Carolina sites and has begun closure activities at all of its jurisdictions. These activities involve moving coal combustion residuals (CCR) to engineered landfills or for reuse, which requires significant planning, permitting, and execution. The costs associated with these closure activities are included in rate proceedings and partially recovered through amended wholesale contracts approved by FERC in 2017. Additionally, the glossary explicitly defines the Coal Ash Act, indicating its regulatory significance and the necessity for Duke Energy to factor compliance into its financial planning and operational timelines.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The Coal Ash Act is defined as the 'North Carolina Coal Ash Management Act of 2014,' establishing its regulatory context.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Duke Energy has completed excavation at three of the four high-priority North Carolina coal ash sites and closure activities have begun across all jurisdictions.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The regulatory requirement (Coal Ash Act) necessitates specific operational actions (excavation and closure), which in turn influence cost recovery strategies and financial planning as seen in the amendment of wholesale contracts and FERC approval."

As of December 31, 2021, the inventory balance for Electric Utilities and Infrastructure was approximately $3 billion. For additional information on inventory, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.'\n\n## Ash Basin Management\n\nDuring 2015, EPA issued regulations related to the management of CCR from power plants. These regulations classify CCR as nonhazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and apply to electric generating sites with new and existing landfills and new and existing surface impoundments and establish requirements regarding landfill design, structural integrity design and assessment criteria for surface impoundments, groundwater monitoring, protection and remedial procedures and other operational and reporting procedures for the disposal and management of CCR. In addition to the federal regulations, CCR landfills and surface impoundments (ash basins or impoundments) will continue to be regulated by existing state laws, regulations and permits, such as the North Carolina Coal Ash Management Act of 2014 (Coal Ash Act).\n\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure has and will periodically submit to applicable authorities required site-specific coal ash impoundment remediation or closure plans. Closure plans must be approved and all associated permits issued before any work can begin. Closure activities have begun in all of Duke Energy's jurisdictions. Excavation began in 2015 at the four sites specified as high priority by the Coal Ash Act and at the W.S. Lee Steam Station site in South Carolina in connection with other legal requirements. Excavation at these sites involves movement of CCR materials to appropriate engineered off-site or on-site lined landfills or for reuse in an approved beneficial application. Duke Energy has completed excavation of coal ash at three of the four high-priority North Carolina sites. At other sites where CCR management is required, planning and closure methods have been studied and factored into the estimated retirement and management costs, and closure activities have commenced.\n\nThe EPA CCR rule and the Coal Ash Act leave the decision on cost recovery determinations related to closure of coal ash surface impoundments to the normal ratemaking processes before utility regulatory commissions. Duke Energy's electric utilities have included compliance costs associated with federal and state requirements in their respective rate proceedings. During 2017, Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress' wholesale contracts were amended to include the recovery of expenditures related to AROs for the closure of coal ash basins. The amended contracts have retail disallowance parity or provisions limiting challenges to CCR cost recovery actions at FERC. FERC approved the amended wholesale rate schedules in 2017. For additional information on the ash basins and recovery, see Item 7, \"Other Matters\" and Notes 3, 4 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" \"Commitments and Contingencies\" and \"Asset Retirement Obligations,\" respectively.\n\n## Nuclear Matters\n\nDuke Energy owns, wholly or partially, 11 operating nuclear reactors located at six operating stations. The Crystal River Unit 3 permanently ceased operation in February 2013. Nuclear insurance includes: nuclear liability coverage; property damage coverage; nuclear accident decontamination and premature decommissioning coverage; and accidental outage coverage for losses in the event of a major accidental outage. Joint owners reimburse Duke Energy for certain expenses associated with nuclear insurance in accordance with joint owner agreements. The Price-Anderson Act requires plant owners to provide for public nuclear liability claims resulting from nuclear incidents to the maximum total financial protection liability, which is approximately $13.5 billion. For additional information on nuclear insurance, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 'Commitments and Contingencies.'\n\nDuke Energy has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decommission and decontaminate each plant safely. The NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC require Duke Energy to update their cost estimates for decommissioning their nuclear plants every five years.\n\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of NDTF investments and the most recent site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost studies. Decommissioning costs are stated in 2018 or 2019 dollars, depending on the year of the cost study, and include costs to decommission plant components not subject to radioactive contamination.\n\n",

      "question": "What is the net financial impact of higher fuel prices on Duke Energy's operating cash flows and operating expenses in 2022, considering the $14 million increase in fuel cost recovery in operating income and the $35 million increase in fuel-related operating expenses?",
      "answer": "The net financial impact of higher fuel prices on Duke Energy's financials in 2022 resulted in a $21 million net increase in costs. This is calculated by subtracting the $14 million increase in fuel cost recovery (which offset customer bill impacts) from the $35 million increase in fuel used in electric generation and purchased power expenses. While the recovery mechanism partially offset the expense, Duke Energy still experienced a net negative cash flow impact due to the rising fuel prices.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_b, identify that fuel cost recovery increased by $14 million due to higher fuel prices, which represents a cost passed on to customers and therefore a partial offset to the company's expenses.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_a, extract the $35 million increase in fuel used in electric generation and purchased power, which reflects the company's direct expense increase due to higher fuel prices.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the net impact by subtracting the $14 million recovery (positive impact) from the $35 million expense increase (negative impact), resulting in a $21 million net cost increase to Duke Energy."

This is calculated by combining the $77 million increase in affiliate and non-affiliate wholesale revenues from one segment and the $79 million increase in affiliate sales offset by the $87 million decrease in non-affiliate sales from another segment. Specifically, affiliate sales increased by $79 million due to a 165.5% rise in the volume of KWH sales, which were conducted in accordance with the IIC-approved FERC pricing mechanism, ensuring energy was sold at marginal cost and stabilizing the financial impact of these internal transactions.",

Wholesale revenues from PPAs have both capacity and energy components. Wholesale capacity revenues from PPAs are recognized in amounts billable under the contract terms and provide for recovery of fixed costs and a return on investment. Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Georgia Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. Short-term opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Georgia Power's variable cost of energy.\n\nWholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost.\n\nIn 2024, other operating revenues increased $171 million, or 24.2%, as compared to 2023 primarily due to increases of $76 million in unregulated sales primarily associated with power delivery construction and maintenance, energy conservation projects, and renewables, $40 million in open access transmission tariff sales, $29 million in regulated sales primarily associated with power delivery construction and maintenance, $23 million in regulated outdoor lighting sales, $8 million in pole attachment revenues, and $8 million in solar program fees, partially offset by a net increase of $17 million in realized losses associated with price stability products for retail customers on variable demand-driven pricing tariffs.\n\n## Energy Sales\n\nChanges in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year.

Slight supply and demand imbalances can quickly result in significant price moves both up and down. These price movements may be short-lived, but the impacts can be pronounced. Natural gas supplies have continued to grow; however, this growth has been accompanied by LNG export growth. Forward curves project prices will remain in the mid- to high-$3 per mmBtu range through 2030; however, short-term price volatility is expected and future prices could be materially impacted by various factors, including unexpected geopolitical events as well as government policies related to natural gas and energy, including infrastructure development, production, and exports.\n\nSouthern Company Gas' procurement plans for natural gas supply and transportation to serve regulated utility customers are reviewed and approved by the regulatory agencies in the states where it operates. Southern Company Gas purchases natural gas supplies in the open market by contracting with producers and marketers and, for Atlanta Gas Light and Chattanooga Gas, under asset management agreements approved by the applicable state regulatory agency. Southern Company Gas also contracts for transportation and storage services from interstate pipelines that are regulated by the FERC. When firm pipeline services are temporarily not needed, Southern Company Gas may release the services in the secondary market under FERC-approved capacity release provisions or utilize asset management arrangements, thereby reducing the net cost of natural gas charged to customers for most of the natural gas distribution utilities. Peak-use requirements are met through utilization of company-owned storage facilities, pipeline transportation capacity, purchased storage services, peaking facilities, and other supply sources, arranged by either transportation customers or Southern Company Gas.\n\nWith the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the natural gas distribution utilities are authorized by the relevant regulatory agencies in the states in which they serve to use natural gas cost recovery mechanisms that adjust rates to reflect changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas and ensure recovery of all costs prudently incurred in purchasing natural gas for customers. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Natural Gas Cost Recovery\" in Item 8 herein for additional information.\n\n## Territory Served by the Southern Company System\n\n## Traditional Electric Operating Companies and Southern Power\n\nThe territory in which the traditional electric operating companies provide retail electric service comprises most of the states of Alabama and Georgia, together with southeastern Mississippi. In this territory there are non-affiliated electric distribution systems that obtain some or all of their power requirements either directly or indirectly from the traditional electric operating companies. As of December 31, 2024, the territory had an area of approx imately 116,000 square miles and an estimated population of approximately 17 million. Southern Power sells wholesale electricity at market-based rates across various U.S. utility markets, primarily to investorowned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers.\n\nAlabama Power is engaged, within the state of Alabama, in the generation, transmission, distribution, and purchase of electricity and the sale of electric service, at retail in approx imately 400 cities and towns (including Anniston, Birmingham, Gadsden, Mobile, Montgomery, and Tuscaloosa), as well as in rural areas, and at wholesale to 11 municipally-owned electric distribution systems, all of which are served indirectly through sales to AMEA, and two rural distributing cooperative associations. The sales contract with AMEA will expire on December 31, 2025. In addition, Alabama Power sells, and cooperates with dealers in promoting the sale of, electric appliances and products and also markets and sells outdoor lighting services.\n\nGeorgia Power is engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution, and purchase of electricity and the sale of electric service within the state of G eorgia, at retail in over 530 cities and towns (including Athens, Atlanta, Augusta, Columbus, Macon, Rome, and Savannah), as well as in rural areas, and at wholesale to OPC, MEAG Power, Dalton, various EMCs, and non-affiliated utilities. Georgia Power also markets and sells outdoor lighting services and other customer-focused utility services.\n\nMississippi Power is engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution, and purchase of electricity and the sale of electric service within 23 counties in southeastern Mississippi, at retail in 123 communities (including Biloxi, Gulfport, Hattiesburg, Laurel, Meridian, and Pascagoula), as well as in rural areas, and at wholesale to one municipality, six rural electric distribution cooperative associations, and one generating and transmitting cooperative.",

      "question": "How did the volume changes in KWH sales to affiliates and non-affiliates in 2024, governed by the Intercompany Interchange Contract (IIC), impact the overall wholesale revenue performance for the Southern Company system?",
      "answer": "The Southern Company system experienced a $87 million (20.5%) decrease in wholesale revenues from non-affiliate sales due to a 30.8% drop in KWH volume after power agreements ended in May 2023. This was partially offset by a $79 million (131.7%) increase in affiliate sales driven by a 165.5% rise in KWH volume, largely due to increased affiliated energy demand. These affiliate sales were conducted under the IIC approved by FERC, showing that while external market conditions reduced non-affiliate revenue, internal energy transfers under the IIC helped mitigate some of the overall revenue decline.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The IIC (Intercompany Interchange Contract) is a formal agreement approved by FERC that governs energy transfers between affiliated companies.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Wholesale sales to non-affiliates dropped $87 million (20.5%) due to a 30.8% decrease in KWH volume after contract expirations.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b - Wholesale sales to affiliates increased $79 million (131.7%) due to a 165.5% increase in KWH volume driven by affiliated energy needs.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The IIC enabled increased affiliate sales volume to partially offset the decline in non-affiliate sales, influencing the overall wholesale revenue performance of the Southern Company system."

The decrease primarily reflects a 30.8% decrease in the volume of KWHs sold as a result of power sales agreements that ended in May 2023.\n\nWholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Alabama Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not affect net income. Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in wholesale energy sales to non-affiliates. These opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Alabama Power's variable cost to produce the energy.\n\nIn 2024, wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates increased $79 million, or 131.7%, as compared to 2023. The revenue increase was primarily due to an increase of 165.5% in the volume of KWH sales due to affiliated company energy needs.\n\nWholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company.

      "answer": "The subjectivity involved in evaluating whether incurred costs will be recovered in future rates or if refunds will be required significantly increases audit complexity and affects financial disclosures for both Georgia Power and Mississippi Power. Management must make significant judgments regarding (1) recovery of incurred costs, (2) potential disallowance of plant costs, and (3) refund obligations to customers. These assessments directly influence the recognition of regulatory assets and liabilities, which in turn affects balance sheet reporting and requires detailed disclosures. Auditors must apply specialized knowledge of rate regulation and assess regulatory precedents to validate these judgments, increasing the complexity of the audit process and the risk of material misstatement.",

      "answer": "The total estimated fair value of NEE's nuclear decommissioning fund assets and FPL's storm fund assets combined as of December 31, 2021, is $8,922 million ($8,846 million for NEE and $76 million for FPL). This amount represents the fair value of the special use funds, which are primarily composed of equity and available-for-sale debt securities. However, on NEE's consolidated balance sheet, these special use funds are reported at their carrying amount of $2,505 million as of December 31, 2021. The significant difference between the fair value and carrying amount reflects the accounting treatment where certain investments are carried at fair value, while others are reported at amortized cost or adjusted based on regulatory treatment.",

The investments held in the special use funds consist of equity and available for sale debt securities which are primarily carried at estimated fair value. The amortized cost of debt securities is approximately $2,438 million and $2,009 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively ($1,877 million and $1,521 million, respectively, for FPL). Debt securities included in the nuclear decommissioning funds have a weighted-average maturity at December 31, 2021 of approximately eight years at both NEE and FPL. FPL's storm fund primarily consists of debt securities with a weighted-average maturity at December 31, 2021 of approximately one year. The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.\n\nEffective January 1, 2020, NEE and FPL adopted an accounting standards update that provides a modified version of the other-than-temporary impairment model for debt securities. The new available for sale debt security impairment model no longer allows consideration of the length of time during which the fair value has been less than its amortized cost basis when determining whether a credit loss exists. Credit losses are required to be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down of securities not intended to be sold or required to be sold. NEE and FPL adopted this model prospectively. See Note 1 - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.\n\nFor FPL's special use funds, changes in fair value of debt and equity securities, including any estimated credit losses of debt securities, result in a  corresponding  adjustment  to  the  related  regulatory  asset  or  liability  accounts,  consistent  with  regulatory  treatment.  For  NEE's  non-rate regulated operations, changes in fair value of debt securities result in a corresponding adjustment to OCI, except for estimated credit losses and unrealized losses on debt securities intended or required to be sold prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis, which are recognized in other net in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Changes in fair value of equity securities are recorded in change in unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities held in NEER's nuclear decommissioning funds - net in NEE's consolidated statements of income.",

      "answer": "The disagreement between Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners over the interpretation of cost-sharing and tender provisions under the Global Amendments has led to Georgia Power recording significant unrecoverable charges. Specifically, Georgia Power recorded a $440 million pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2021 related to these provisions, and may face an additional $460 million in charges based on the current project capital cost forecast. These costs will not be recovered from retail customers, directly increasing Georgia Power\u2019s financial exposure. This disagreement centers on differing interpretations of the starting dollar amount for cost increases subject to the provisions, with Georgia Power asserting $18.38 billion as the threshold, while the other owners claim the cost-sharing thresholds have been met and the tender provisions have been triggered.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)\n\nSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in these future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded total pre-tax charges to income of $1.1 billion ($0.8 billion after tax) in the second quarter 2018; $149 million ($111 million after tax) and $176 million ($131 million after tax) in the second quarter and the fourth quarter 2020, respectively; and $48 million ($36 million after tax), $460 million ($343 million after tax), $264 million ($197 million after tax), and $480 million ($358 million after tax) in the first quarter 2021, the second quarter 2021, the third quarter 2021, and the fourth quarter 2021, respectively.\n\nGeorgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners do not agree on either the starting dollar amount for the determination of cost increases subject to the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments (as defined in Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction - Joint Owner Contracts\") or the extent to which COVID-19-related costs impact the calculation. Based on the definition in the Global Amendments, Georgia Power believes the starting dollar amount is $18.38 billion and the current project capital cost forecast has triggered the cost-sharing provisions. The other V ogtle Owners have asserted that the project cost increases have reached the cost-sharing thresholds and have triggered the tender provisions under the Global Amendments. Georgia Power recorded an additional pre-tax charge to income in the fourth quarter 2021 of approximately $440 million ($328 million after tax) associated with these cost-sharing and tender provisions, which is included in the total project capital cost forecast. Georgia Power may be required to record further pre-tax charges to income of up to approximately $460 million associated with these provisions based on the current project capital cost forecast. The incremental charges associated with these provisions will not be recovered from retail customers. On October 29, 2021, Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners entered into an agreement to clarify the process for the tender provisions of the Global Amendments to provide for a decision between 120 and 180 days after the tender option is triggered, which the other Vogtle Owners assert occurred on February 14, 2022. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction - Joint Owner Contracts\" for additional information on the Global Amendments.\n\nAs part of its ongoing processes, Southern Nuclear continues to evaluate cost and schedule forecasts on a regular basis to incorporate current information available, particularly in the areas of engineering support, commodity installation, system turnovers and related test results, and workforce statistics. Georgia Power estimates the productivity impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have consumed approximately three to four months of schedule margin previously embedded in the site work plan for Unit 3 and Unit 4.\n\nAs Unit 3 completes system turnover from construction and moves to testing and transition to operations, ongoing and potential future challenges include completion of construction remediation work, completion of work packages, including inspection records, and other documentation necessary to submit the remaining ITAACs and begin fuel load, and final component and pre-operational tests. As Unit 4 progresses through construction and continues to transition into testing, ongoing and potential future challenges include the pace and quality of electrical installation, availability of craft and supervisory resources, including the temporary diversion of such resources to support Unit 3 construction efforts, and the pace of work package closures and system turnovers. As construction, including subcontract work, continues on both Units 3 and 4, ongoing or future challenges include management of contractors and vendors; subcontractor performance; supervision of craft labor and related productivity, particularly in the installation of electrical, mechanical, and instrumentation and controls commodities, ability to attract and retain craft labor, and/or related cost escalation; and procurement and related installation. New challenges may arise, particularly as Units 3 and 4 move into initial testing and start-up, which may result in required engineering changes or remediation related to plant systems, structures, or components (some of which are based on new technology that only within the last few years began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale). The ongoing and potential future challenges described above may change the projected schedule and estimated cost. In addition, the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could further disrupt or delay construction and testing activities at Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4.\n\nThere have been technical and procedural challenges to the construction and licensing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 at the federal and state level and additional challenges may arise. Processes are in place that are designed to ensure compliance with the requirements specified in the Westinghouse Design Control Document and the combined construction and operating licenses, including inspections by Southern Nuclear and the NRC that occur throughout construction. Findings resulting from such inspections could require additional remediation and/or further NRC oversight. In addition, certain license amendment requests have been filed and approved or are pending before the NRC. Various design and other licensing-based compliance matters, including the timely submittal by Southern Nuclear of the ITAAC documentation for each unit and the related reviews and approvals by the NRC necessary to support NRC authorization to load fuel, have arisen or may arise, which may result in additional license amendments or require other resolution. If any license amendment requests or other licensing-based compliance issues, including inspections and ITAACs, are not resolved in a timely manner, there may be delays in the project schedule that could result in increased costs.\n\nThe ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. However, any extension of the in-service date beyond the first quarter 2023 for Unit 3 or the fourth quarter 2023 for Unit 4, including the current level of cost sharing described in Note",

      "answer": "Southern Company's adoption of the fair value approach for liability-hedging securities results in the immediate recognition of changes in the market value of these plan assets, as opposed to amortizing these changes over five years under the calculated value approach. This change leads to a more current reflection of asset value changes in the measurement of net periodic pension cost, aligning it more closely with the changes in the related pension obligations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, Southern Company changed its method for liability-hedging securities from the calculated value approach to the fair value approach effective January 1, 2020.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, the fair value approach measures the market-related value of liability-hedging plan assets at fair value, whereas return-seeking assets continue to be valued using the calculated value approach, which amortizes changes over five years.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize: The fair value approach for liability-hedging assets results in immediate recognition of market value changes in the expected return on plan assets calculation, unlike the amortization method used for return-seeking assets, thereby aligning the measurement of net periodic pension cost more closely with current market conditions and related obligations."

      "answer": "The minimum working capital requirements restrict the ability of Duke Energy subsidiaries to transfer funds to the parent company through dividends, loans, or advances. These restrictions are imposed by regulators and contractual agreements, and while they cap the amount of internal funding available, Duke Energy states that these restrictions are not material to its overall net assets. Despite these constraints, Duke Energy plans to fund its $6.9 billion 2024 debt issuance plan primarily through external capital markets, supported by its Master Credit Facility if necessary, indicating that the company does not expect the working capital restrictions to significantly impact its ability to meet capital expenditure and debt maturity obligations.",

      "answer": "The Ohio tax reform deferrals contributed $6 million to the GU&I segment's operating revenues in 2023. Additionally, the EU&I segment referenced Ohio tax reform deferrals as part of a $276 million increase in pricing, which included impacts from prior-year deferrals. Therefore, the total impact of Ohio tax reform deferrals across both segments was at least $282 million. The prior year's deferral influenced current year reporting by contributing to revenue recognition in both segments, specifically through base rate adjustments and rate case outcomes tied to historical deferral impacts.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The GU&I segment reported a $6 million increase in operating revenues due to Ohio tax reform deferrals.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The EU&I segment reported a $276 million increase in pricing influenced by rate cases, including the Duke Energy Ohio electric rate case, which explicitly referenced prior-year Ohio tax reform deferrals.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - To determine the total financial impact of Ohio tax reform deferrals, both the $6 million from GU&I and the $276 million from EU&I must be combined, resulting in a total of $282 million. Additionally, the prior year's deferral directly affected current year revenue recognition through rate adjustments and regulatory decisions."

      "answer": "HB 951 mandated a 70% interim CO\u2082 reduction target for public utilities in North Carolina on the least-cost path to carbon neutrality by 2050 and introduced performance-based ratemaking (PBR), which includes MYRP, PIMS, and residential decoupling. In response, Duke Energy filed a proposed Carbon Plan in May 2022 and submitted an updated Carolinas IRP in August 2023, outlining a 15-year clean energy transition strategy that includes grid modernization, natural gas infrastructure improvements, and the development of green hydrogen production. Financially, PBR supports more efficient recovery of investments, aligning with Duke Energy's $1.5 billion recovery of deferred fuel costs in 2023 and its goal to return to historical average deferred fuel cost balances by the end of 2024. Therefore, HB 951 directly shapes both Duke Energy\u2019s long-term clean energy planning and its near-term financial strategies through regulatory mechanisms that enable cost recovery and performance incentives.",

      "question": "Given Duke Energy Ohio's requirement to maintain equity at no less than 30% of total capital and the estimated $2.8 billion in total storm-related costs across Duke Energy's subsidiaries, how might the financial obligations from these storm costs impact Duke Energy Ohio's ability to maintain its equity requirement, particularly if additional capital expenditures are needed beyond the $2.6 billion already incurred by December 31, 2024?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy Ohio must maintain equity at no less than 30% of total capital, which could be challenged by the significant storm-related costs across the company's subsidiaries. With $2.6 billion of the $2.8 billion total storm costs already incurred by the end of 2024, any additional capital expenditures required\u2014particularly the $0.2 billion expected in 2025\u2014could place further pressure on the company\u2019s capital structure. If these costs are financed through debt or if retained earnings are reduced due to rebuilding expenses, Duke Energy Ohio may face difficulties maintaining the required 30% equity threshold, potentially requiring regulatory intervention or internal financial adjustments to remain compliant.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Duke Energy Ohio must maintain equity at no less than 30% of total capital.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - The significant capital expenditures required for storm recovery could reduce retained earnings or increase debt, both of which could threaten Duke Energy Ohio\u2019s ability to maintain the 30% equity requirement."

      "question": "What specific regulatory treatment do the costs associated with the 2021 Settlement Agreement receive under Duke Energy Florida's rate base accounting, and how does this align with the definition of regulatory assets in the 2024 10-K filing?",
      "answer": "The costs associated with the 2021 Settlement Agreement are either included in the rate base or their recovery period is undetermined, as per Duke Energy Florida's 2024 10-K filing. This aligns with the regulatory asset treatment described in the filing, where certain costs may be included in the rate base and can earn a return, depending on regulatory determinations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, we learn that the 2021 Settlement Agreement involves Duke Energy Florida and multiple parties, and the expected recovery or refund period for the associated costs varies or has not been determined. Some costs may be included in the rate base.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, we find that the 2021 Settlement is formally defined in the glossary of terms, indicating its significance in Duke Energy Florida's regulatory and financial disclosures.",
        "Step 3: Synthesizing both sources, the regulatory treatment of the 2021 Settlement costs is consistent with how Duke Energy Florida accounts for regulatory assets \u2014 some are included in the rate base, and others remain pending regulatory decisions, which is explicitly stated in the footnotes and definitions provided in the 2024 10-K filing."

      "answer": "The dollar value of NEE's non-qualifying hedge activity decreased from $125 million in 2022 to $113 million in 2023, representing a year-over-year decline of $12 million. This decrease in non-qualifying hedge activity contributed to NEER's improved financial performance, as the segment experienced favorable hedge activity compared to the prior year. NEER's results in 2023 were positively impacted by this favorable non-qualifying hedge activity, which helped drive increased earnings despite other challenges such as the OTTI impairment related to its investment in NEP.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_b, extract the non-qualifying hedge activity values: $125 million in 2022 and $113 million in 2023 for NEER.",

      "question": "How does FPL's deferral of energy derivative gains through the fuel clause mechanism specifically contribute to NEE's $3,163 million increase in net income for 2023, and what does this reveal about the relationship between regulatory accounting policies and earnings volatility?",
      "answer": "FPL defers substantially all changes in the fair value of energy derivative transactions as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled, with any gains or losses passed through the fuel clause. In 2023, approximately $300 million of gains from derivative transactions are included in FPL's net income, which directly contributes to the $851 million increase in FPL's net income. This, in turn, supports NEE's overall $3,163 million increase in net income for 2023. This reveals that regulatory accounting policies like the fuel clause reduce earnings volatility at FPL by deferring unrealized gains and losses until settlement, allowing for a more stable earnings profile that contributes to NEE's consolidated financial performance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - The fuel clause is defined as the 'fuel and purchased power cost recovery clause, as established by the FPSC', which directly links to how FPL manages derivative gains.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - FPL's $851 million net income increase includes approximately $300 million of gains from derivative transactions, which are deferred through the fuel clause mechanism.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - FPL's deferral of derivative gains through the fuel clause stabilizes its earnings, contributing directly to NEE's consolidated $3,163 million increase in net income. This shows how regulatory accounting policies reduce earnings volatility."

      "answer": "The difference in magnitude between NEER's $1,729 million of non-qualifying hedge gains and FPL's $300 million of gains included in net income was $1,429 million. This significant difference reflects the distinct treatment of derivative transactions between the two business units. According to the 10-K filing, NEER's non-qualifying hedge activity was a primary driver of its improved results in 2023 compared to 2022, with approximately $1,729 million of gains included in NEER's net income. In contrast, FPL's derivative transactions are largely deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities until contract settlement, with only $300 million of gains passed through to net income in 2023. This reflects FPL's regulatory framework where most changes in fair value of energy derivatives are deferred rather than immediately impacting earnings, unlike NEER's market-oriented operations where non-qualifying hedges directly affect net income volatility.",

      "answer": "The total financial position for FPL's Non-Qualifying Hedges and Hedges in FPL Cost Recovery Clauses decreased from $3 million in 2022 to $2 million in 2023, a $1 million drop. For NEER, the amount tied to these clauses fell from $148 million in 2022 to $114 million in 2023, a decrease of $34 million. Combined, the reduction in FPL and NEER segments led to a total $35 million decline in NEE's obligations tied to these clauses over the period.",

      "answer": "Southern Company's compliance with IRS requirements directly affects its financial reporting of asset retirement obligations (AROs) for nuclear decommissioning because the external trust funds (used to comply with NRC regulations) are invested in a tax-efficient manner and must adhere to IRS investment guidelines. Gains and losses from these investments\u2014whether realized or unrealized\u2014are recorded in the regulatory liability for AROs on the balance sheets, not in net income or OCI. For example, Alabama Power and Georgia Power adjust their ARO liabilities based on fair value changes in these funds, which are determined on a specific identification basis. This ensures that the financial statements reflect the current status of the funds while complying with IRS rules on how these investments are managed and reported.",
