Under  our  shelf  registration,  we  may  issue,  from  time  to  time,  any  combination  of  debt  securities,  preferred  stock, common stock, or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings. The Board of Directors authorized the issuance of up to $9.0 billion of debt securities, replacing the prior Board authorization in February 2022, which had $5.6 billion of authority remaining.\n\nDuring the year ended  December 31, 2024, we did not issue any debt securities under this registration statement. At  December 31, 2024, we had remaining authority from the Board of Directors to issue up to $9.0 billion of debt securities under our shelf registration.\n\nReceivables Securitization Facility - As  of  both  December  31,  2024  and  2023,  we  recorded  $0  of  borrowings  under  our  Receiv ables  Facility,  as secured debt. (See further discussion in the \"Receiv ables Securitization Facility\" section of Note 10.)\n\n## 15. Variable Interest Entities\n\nWe have entered into v arious lease transactions in which the structure of the leases contain v ariable interest entities (VIEs). T hese VIEs were created solely for the purpose of doing lease transactions (principally inv olv ing railroad equipment and facilities) and hav e no other activ ities, assets, or liabilities outside of the lease transactions. Within these lease arrangements, we hav e the right to purchase some or all of the assets at fixed prices. Depending on  market  conditions,  fixed-price  purchase  options  av ailable  in  the  leases  could  potentially  prov ide  benefits  to  us;  howev er ,  these  benefits  are  not expected to be significant.\n\nWe maintain and operate the assets based on contractual obligations within the lease arrangements, which set specific guidelines consistent within the railroad industry. As such, we hav e no control ov er activ ities that could materially impact the fair v alue of the leased assets. We do not hold the power to direct the activ ities of the VIEs and, therefore, do not control the ongoing activ ities that hav e a significant impact on the economic performance of the VIEs. Additionally,  we  do  not  hav e  the  obligation  to  absorb  losses  of  the  VIEs  or  the  right  to  receiv e  benefits  of  the  VIEs  that  could  potentially  be significant to the VIEs.\n\nWe are not considered to be the primary beneficiary  and  do  not  consolidate  these  VIEs  because  our  actions  and  decisions  do  not  hav e  the  most significant effect on the VIE's performance and our fixed-price purchase options are not considered to be potentially significant to the VIEs. T he future minimum lease payments associated with the VIE leases totaled $609 million as of December 31, 2024, and are recorded as operating lease liabilities at present v alue in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\n\n## 16.

          "chunk_text": "\nAs a result of put provisions associated with certain debt instruments, long-term debt payments due in 2025 include floating rate notes totaling $119 million (classified as current portion of long-term debt).\n\nCredit Facilities: 3M has a $4.25 billion five-year revolving credit facility that ex pires in May 2028. The revolving credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to $1.0 billion (at lender's discretion), bringing the total facility up to $5.25 billion. The credit facility was undrawn at December 31, 2024. Under the $4.25 billion credit facility, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (based on amounts defined in the amended agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest ex pense on all funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2024, 3M was in compliance with this requirement. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends.\n\nOther Credit Facilities: The Company also had $0.5 billion in stand-alone letters of credit, bank guarantees, and other similar instruments issued and outstanding at December 31, 2024. These instruments are utilized in connection with normal business activities.\n\nSolventum Related Debt: In the first quarter of 2024, Solventum, prior to the Separation discussed in Note 2, issued a total of $8.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured debt and term loans. Also during the first quarter of 2024, Solventum further entered into a revolving credit facility of $2 billion which was undrawn as of March 31, 2024. These Solventum items were guaranteed by 3M until the completion of the Separation on April 1, 2024 and obligations under these notes, loans and facilities became, as transferred obligations, the sole responsibility of Solventum after the Separation.\n\nFixed-to-Floating Interest Rate Swaps: During 2021, 3M entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $800 million. These swaps converted $500 million and $300 million of 3M's $1 billion and $650 million principal amount of fix ed rate notes due 2049 and 2050, respectively, into floating rate debt for the portion of their terms through mid-2028 with an original interest rate based on a three-month LIBOR index, which since was amended to a rate based on a SOFR index.\n\nLong-Term Debt Maturities and Extinguishments: In 2024, 3M repaid $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes that matured.\n\nIn 2023, 3M repaid $500 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate registered notes that matured, $650 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate mediumterm notes that matured and 600 million euros aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate medium-term notes that matured.\n\nIn 2022, 3M repaid 500 million euros aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate medium-term notes that matured and $600 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate medium-term notes that matured.\n\nFloating Rate Notes: At various times, 3M has issued floating rate notes containing put provisions, amounting to $0.2 billion in total. 3M would be required to repurchase these securities at various prices ranging from 99 percent to 100 percent of par value according to the reduction schedules for each security. Under the terms of this floating rate note due in 2044, holders have an annual put feature at 100 percent of par value from 2014 and every anniversary thereafter until final maturity. Under the terms of the floating rate notes due in 2027, 2040 and 2041, holders have put options that commence ten years from the date of issuance and each third anniversary thereafter until final maturity at prices ranging from 99 percent to 100 percent of par value. For the periods presented, 3M was required to repurchase an immaterial amount of principal on the aforementioned floating rate notes.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nEffective February 8, 2023, the Company renewed its 'well-known seasoned issuer' (WKSI) shelf registration statement, which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future issuance and sale. 3M also has a medium-term notes program (Series F) program, originally established in 2016, up to an aggregate principal amount of $18 billion. As of December 31, 2024, the total amount of debt issued under the (Series F) program is approximately $17.6 billion (utilizing the foreign exchange rates applicable at the time of issuance for the euro denominated debt). The Company has not issued any debt under the (Series F) program since February 2019 and does not intend to issue any additional debt under this program in the future.\n\nInformation with respect to long-term debt issuances and maturities for the periods presented is included in Note 14.\n\n3M has a $4.25 billion five-year revolving credit facility that ex pires in May 2028. The revolving credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to $1.0 billion (at lender's discretion), bringing the total facility up to $5.25 billion. The credit facility was undrawn at December 31, 2024.

These instruments are utilized in connection with normal business activities.\n\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities: At December 31, 2024, 3M had $7.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $3.5 billion was held by the Company's foreign subsidiaries and approximately $4.2 billion was held in the United States. These balances are invested in bank instruments and other high quality securities. At December 31, 2023, 3M had $5.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $3.1 billion was held by the Company's foreign subsidiaries and $2.7 billion was held by the United States. The increase from December 31, 2023 was driven by $8.4 billion in proceeds from debt (primarily related to Solventum's issuance of debt prior to the Separation as discussed in Note 14) partially offset by approximately $4.6 billion in payments associated with PFAS-related other environmental liabilities and the CAE legal settlement (both discussed in Note 19 - note also the \"Material Cash Requirements from Known Contractual and Other Obligations\" section further below) and debt maturities.\n\nNet Debt (non-GAAP measure): Net debt is not defined under U.S. GAAP and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines net debt as total debt less the total of cash, cash equivalents and current and long-term marketable securities all on a continuing operations basis. 3M believes net debt is meaningful to investors as 3M considers net debt and its components to be important indicators of liquidity and financial position. The table below provides net debt as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\n",

Fair Value Measurements\n\nAssets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis: For 3M, assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis primarily relate to available-for-sale marketable securities, Solventum common stock and derivative instruments. The information in the following paragraphs and tables primarily addresses matters relative to these financial assets and liabilities. Separately, there were no material fair value measurements with respect to nonfinancial assets or liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the Company's financial statements on a recurring basis for 2024 and 2023.\n\n3M uses various valuation techniques, which are primarily based upon the market and income approaches, with respect to financial assets and liabilities. Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the respective financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value.\n\n- Available-for-sale marketable securities - except certain U.S. municipal securities: Marketable securities, except certain U.S. municipal securities, are valued utilizing multiple sources. A weighted average price is used for these securities. Market prices are obtained for these securities from a variety of industry standard data providers, security master files from large financial institutions, and other third-party sources. These multiple prices are used as inputs into a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine the daily fair value to be used. 3M classifies U.S. treasury securities as level 1, while all other marketable securities (ex cluding certain U.S. municipal securities) are classified as level 2. Marketable securities are discussed further in Note 13.\n- Available-for-sale marketable securities -certain U.S. municipal securities only : 3M holds municipal securities with several cities in the United States as of December 31, 2024. Due to the nature of these securities, the valuation method references the carrying value of the corresponding finance lease obligation, and as such, will be classified as level 3 securities separately.\n- Solventum common stock: Solventum Corporation common stock is carried at stock prices that are readily available from active markets and are representative of fair value. 3M classifies this investment as Level 1. It is included within other assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.\n- Derivative instruments : The Company's derivative assets and liabilities within the scope of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , are required to be recorded at fair value. The Company's derivatives that are recorded at fair value include foreign currency forward and option contracts, interest rate swaps, and net investment hedges where the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. Net investment hedges that use foreign currency denominated debt to hedge 3M's net investment are not impacted by the fair value measurement standard under ASC 820, as the debt used as the hedging instrument is marked to a value with respect to changes in spot foreign currency exchange rates and not with respect to other factors that may impact fair value.\n\n3M has determined that foreign currency forward and option contracts and interest rate swaps will be considered level 2 measurements. 3M uses inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset. These inputs include foreign currency exchange rates, volatilities, and interest rates. Derivative positions are primarily valued using standard calculations/models that use as their basis readily observable market parameters. Industry standard data providers are 3M's primary source for forward and spot rate information for both interest rates and currency rates, with resulting valuations periodically validated through thirdparty or counterparty quotes and a net present value stream of cash flows model.",

The  increase  was  primarily attributable to higher product costs of approximately $560 million at RMS due to higher production volume on various Sikorsky helicopter programs and for TLS programs due to the delivery of an international pilot training system; $435 million at Aeronautics due to higher volume on classified contracts and F-16 production contracts, partially offset by lower volume on F-35 development contracts; $345 million at MFC due to higher volume on PAC-3, LRASM and JASSM programs; partially offset by lower product costs of approximately $65 million at Space due to the renationalization of AWE, partially offset by higher volume on hypersonic development, Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) and Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next Gen OPIR) programs.\n\n## Service Costs\n\nService  costs  increased  approximately  $92  million,  or  1%,  in  2021  compared  to  2020.  The  increase  in  service  costs  was primarily  due  to  higher  service  costs  of  approximately  $85  million  at Aeronautics  due  to  higher  sustainment  volume  on  F-35, partially offset by lower sustainment volume on F-22.\n\n## Severance and Restructuring Charges\n\nDuring  2021,  we  recorded  severance  and  restructuring  charges  of  $36  million  ($28  million,  or  $0.10  per  share,  after-tax) associated  with  plans  to  close  and  consolidate  certain  facilities  and  reduce  total  workforce  within  our  RMS  business  segment. During 2020, we recorded severance charges totaling $27 million ($21 million, or $0.08 per share, after-tax) related to the planned elimination of certain positions primarily at our corporate functions.\n\n## Other Unallocated, Net\n\nOther unallocated, net primarily includes the FAS/CAS operating adjustment (which represents the difference between CAS pension cost recorded in our business segments' results of operations and the service cost component of FAS pension (expense) income), stock-based compensation expense and other corporate costs. These items are not allocated to the business segments and, therefore, are not allocated to cost of sales for products or services. Other unallocated, net reduced cost of sales by $1.8 billion in 2021,  compared  to  $1.7  billion  in  2020.  Other  unallocated,  net  during  2021  was  higher  primarily  due  to  an  increase  in  our FAS/CAS operating adjustment and fluctuations in costs associated with various corporate items, none of which were individually significant.  See  'Business  Segment  Results  of  Operations'  and  'Critical  Accounting  Policies  -  Postretirement  Benefit  Plans' discussion below for more information on our pension cost.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nOther income (expense), net generally includes earnings generated by equity method investees. Other income, net in 2021 was $62 million, compared to other expense, net of $10 million in 2020. Other income, net in 2021 included lower earnings generated by  equity  method  investments;  however,  other  expense,  net  in  2020  included  a  noncash  impairment  charge  of  $128  million ($96  million ,  or $0.34  per  share,  after-tax)  related  to  our  previous  investment  in Advanced  Military  Maintenance,  Repair  and Overhaul Center (AMMROC), which was sold in 2020. See 'Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Interest Expense\n\nInterest  expense  in  2021  was  $569  million,  compared  to  $591  million  in  2020.  The  decrease  in  interest  expense  in  2021 resulted primarily from our scheduled repayment of debt in October 2020 and September 2021 of $500 million each. See 'Capital Structure, Resources and Other' included within 'Liquidity and Cash Flows' discussion below and 'Note 11 - Debt' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our debt.\n\n## Non-Service FAS Pension (Expense) Income\n\nNon-service FAS pension expense was $1.3 billion in 2021, compared to income of $219 million in 2020. Non-service FAS pension expense in 2021 includes a noncash pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion ($1.3 billion, or $4.72 per share, after-tax), related  to  the  transfer  of  $4.9  billion  of  our  gross  defined  benefit  pension  obligations  and  related  plan  assets  to  an  insurance company.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nComparability of our segment sales, operating  profit  and  operating  margin  may  be  impacted  favorably  or  unfavorably  by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost  method  to  measure  progress  towards  completion.  Increases  in  the  profit  booking  rates,  typically  referred  to  as  risk retirements,  usually  relate  to  revisions  in  the  estimated  total  costs  to  fulfill  the  performance  obligations  that  reflect  improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the period they are determined and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring  charges,  except  for  significant  severance  actions,  which  are  excluded  from  segment  operating  results;  reserves  for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.\n\nOur  consolidated  net  adjustments  not  related  to  volume,  including  net  profit  booking  rate  adjustments  and  other  items, increased segment operating profit by approximately $2.0 billion in 2021, $1.8 billion in 2020 and $1.9 billion in 2019. These adjustments increased net earnings by approximately $1.6 billion ($5.81 per share) in 2021 and $1.5 billion ($5.33 and $5.29 per share)  in  2020  and  2019.  We  recognized  net  sales  from  performance  obligations  satisfied  in  prior  periods  of  approximately $2.2 billion, $2.0 billion and $2.2 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, which primarily relate to changes in profit booking rates that impacted revenue.\n\nWe have  experienced  performance  issues  on  a  classified  fixed-price  incentive  fee  contract  that  involves  highly  complex design  and  systems  integration  at  our  Aeronautics  business  segment.  During  the  second  quarter  of  2021,  we  completed  a comprehensive  review  and  negotiation  of  scope  of  the  program  with  our  customer,  including  the  technical  requirements, performance to date, remaining work, schedule, and estimated costs to complete the program. At the conclusion of the review, we determined that the total costs to complete the current phase of the program would exceed the contract price. Accordingly, during the second quarter of 2021, we recognized a loss of $225 million ($169 million, or $0.61 per share, after tax) on the program at our Aeronautics business segment, which represented our estimated total losses on the current phase of the program. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we amended the contract with our customer to modify the contract scope and price. The terms of the amendment are  consistent  with  the  assumptions  used  to  estimate  the  loss  recognized  in  the  second  quarter  of  2021.  Therefore,  our  current estimated loss remains at $225 million. We will continue to monitor our performance, any future changes in scope, and estimated costs to complete the program and may have to record additional losses in future periods if we experience further performance issues, increases in scope, or cost growth, which could be material to our operating results. In addition, we and our industry team will incur advanced procurement costs (also referred to as precontract costs) in order to enhance our ability to achieve the revised schedule  and  certain  milestones.  We  will  monitor  the  recoverability  of  precontract  costs,  which  could  be  impacted  by  the customer's decision regarding future phases of the program.\n\nWe are responsible for a program to design, develop and construct a ground-based radar at our RMS business segment. The program has experienced performance issues for which we have periodically accrued reserves. Cumulative losses on this program were approximately $280 million as of December 31, 2021. We will continue to monitor our performance, any future changes in scope, and estimated costs to complete the program and may have to record additional losses in future periods if we experience further performance issues, increases in scope, or cost growth. However, based on the losses previously recorded and our current estimate of the sales and costs to complete the program, at this time we do not anticipate that additional losses, if any, would be material to our operating results or financial condition.\n\nWe have a program, EADGE-T, to design, integrate and install an air missile defense command, control, communications, computers - intelligence (C4I) system for an international customer that has experienced performance issues and for which we have periodically accrued reserves at our RMS business segment. We last recorded a charge and accrued reserves for this program in 2017. As  of  December  31,  2021,  cumulative  losses  remained  at  approximately  $260  million.  We  continue  to  monitor  program requirements and our performance. At this time, we do not anticipate additional charges that would be material to our operating results or financial condition.",

      "answer": "Lockheed Martin's use of the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method directly affects its profit booking rates when there are changes in cost estimates. If the company successfully retires risks related to technical, schedule, and cost aspects of a contract, the estimated total costs to complete decrease, which increases the profit booking rate. Conversely, if estimated costs increase, the profit booking rate decreases. These changes are recognized in the period they are determined and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such revisions. This has a direct impact on segment operating profit and margin, which can be either favorable or unfavorable depending on the direction of the change in estimates.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Description of the Matter\n\n## How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\n## Description of the Matter\n\n## Revenue recognition based on the percentage of completion method\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the Corporation recorded net sales of $67.0 billion. As more fully described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation generates the majority of its net sales from long-term contracts with its customers whereby substantially all of the Corporation's revenue is recognized  over  time  using  the  percentage-of-completion  cost-to-cost  measure  of  progress.  Under  the percentage-of-completion  cost-to-cost  measure  of  progress,  the  Corporation  measures  progress  towards completion  based  on  the  ratio  of  costs  incurred  to  date  to  the  estimated  total  costs  to  complete  the performance  obligation(s)  (referred  to  as  the  estimate-at-completion  analysis).  The  Corporation  estimates profit  on  these  contracts  as  the  difference  between  total  estimated  revenues  and  total  estimated  cost  at completion.\n\nThe percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to estimate contract sales and costs associated with its contracts with customers. At the outset of a long-term contract, the Corporation identifies risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract. Throughout the contract life cycle, the Corporation monitors and assesses the effects of  those  risks  on  its  estimates  of  sales  and  total  costs  to  complete  the  contract.  Profit  booking  rates  may increase during the performance of the contract if the Corporation successfully retires risks surrounding the technical,  schedule  and  cost  aspects  of  the  contract,  which  would  decrease  the  estimated  total  costs  to complete  the  contract.  Conversely,  the  profit  booking  rates  may  decrease  if  the  estimated  total  costs  to complete the contract increase. Changes to the profit booking rates resulting from changes in estimates could have a material effect on the Corporation's results of operations.\n\nAuditing  the  Corporation's  estimate-at-completion  analyses  used  in  its  revenue  recognition  process  was complex  due  to  the  judgment  involved  in  evaluating  the  significant  estimates  and  assumptions  made  by management in the creation and subsequent updates to the Corporation's estimate-at-completion analyses. The estimate-at-completion analyses of each contract consider risks surrounding the Corporation's ability to achieve the technical, schedule, and cost aspects of the contract.\n\nWe  obtained  an  understanding,  evaluated  the  design  and  tested  the  operating  effectiveness  of  relevant internal  controls  over  the  Corporation's  revenue  recognition  process.  For  example,  we  tested  internal controls over management's review of the estimate-at-completion analyses and the significant assumptions underlying  the  estimated  contract  value  and  estimated  total  costs  to  complete.  We  also  tested  internal controls  that  management  executes  to  validate  the  data  used  in  the  estimate-at-completion  analyses  was complete and accurate.\n\nTo test  the  accuracy  of  the  Corporation's  estimate-at-completion  analyses,  our  audit  procedures  included, among others, comparing estimates of labor costs, subcontractor costs, and materials to historical results of similar contracts, and agreeing the key terms to contract documentation and management's estimates. We also  performed  sensitivity  analyses  over  the  significant  assumptions  to  evaluate  the  change  in  the  profit booking rates resulting from changes in the assumptions.\n\n## Defined Benefit Pension Plan Obligation\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the Corporation's aggregate obligation for its qualified defined benefit pension plans was $43.5 billion and exceeded the gross fair value of the related plan assets of $35.2 billion, resulting in a net  unfunded qualified defined benefit pension obligation of $8.3 billion. As explained in Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation remeasures the qualified defined benefit pension assets and  obligations  at  the  end  of  each  year  or  more  frequently  upon  the  occurrence  of  certain  events.  The amounts are measured using actuarial valuations, which depend on key assumptions such as the discount rate and participant longevity.\n\nAuditing the defined benefit pension obligation was complex and required the involvement of specialists as a result of the judgmental nature of the actuarial assumptions such as discount rate and participant longevity, used  in  the  measurement  process.  These  assumptions  have  a  significant  effect  on  the  projected  benefit obligation, with the discount rate being the most sensitive of those assumptions.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nFor performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the performance obligation(s). For performance obligations to provide services to the customer, revenue is recognized over time based on costs incurred or the right to invoice method (in situations where the value transferred matches our billing rights) as our customer receives and consumes the benefits.\n\nFor performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied. This coincides with the point in time the customer obtains control of the product or service, which typically occurs upon customer acceptance or receipt of the product or service, given that we maintain control of the product or service until that point.\n\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales and costs, including the profit booking rate. At the outset of a long-term contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the  contract,  as  well  as  variable  consideration,  and  assess  the  effects  of  those  risks  on  our  estimates  of  sales  and  total  costs  to complete  the  contract.  The  estimates  consider  the  technical  requirements  (e.g.,  a  newly-developed  product  versus  a  mature product),  the  schedule  and  associated  tasks  (e.g.,  the  number  and  type  of  milestone  events)  and  costs  (e.g.,  material,  labor, subcontractor,  overhead,  general  and  administrative  and  the  estimated  costs  to  fulfill  our  industrial  cooperation  agreements, sometimes  referred  to  as  offset  or  localization  agreements,  required  under  certain  contracts  with  international  customers).  The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated  total  costs  to  complete  the  contract  or  may  increase  the  variable  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  on  the  contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase or our estimates of variable  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  decrease. All  of  the  estimates  are  subject  to  change  during  the  performance  of  the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of the transaction price, a provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.\n\nComparability of our segment sales, operating  profit  and  operating  margin  may  be  impacted  favorably  or  unfavorably  by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost  method  to  measure  progress  towards  completion.  Increases  in  the  profit  booking  rates,  typically  referred  to  as  risk retirements,  usually  relate  to  revisions  in  the  estimated  total  costs  to  fulfill  the  performance  obligations  that  reflect  improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the period they are determined and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring  charges,  except  for  significant  severance  actions,  which  are  excluded  from  segment  operating  results;  reserves  for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.\n\n## Other Contract Accounting Considerations\n\nThe majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. Government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the FAR. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are  allowable  in  establishing  prices  for  goods  and  services  under  U.S.  Government  contracts.  For  example,  costs  such  as  those related  to  charitable  contributions,  interest  expense  and  certain  advertising  and  public  relations  activities  are  unallowable  and, therefore, not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into advance agreements with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For example, most of the environmental costs we incur for environmental remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under FAR provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the U.S. Government.\n\nWe  closely  monitor  compliance  with  and  the  consistent  application  of  our  critical  accounting  policies  related  to  contract accounting.  Costs  incurred  and  allocated  to  contracts  are  reviewed  for  compliance  with  U.S.  Government  regulations  by  our personnel and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.",

We also may enter into derivative instruments  that  are  not  designated  as  hedges  and  do  not  qualify  for  hedge  accounting,  which  are  intended  to  mitigate  certain economic exposures.\n\nThe classification of gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of derivatives is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation. Adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives attributable to highly effective hedges are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustments to the hedged items or reflected net of income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are not highly effective, if any, are immediately recognized in earnings. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $500 million and $572 million. The aggregate notional amount  of  our  outstanding  foreign  currency  hedges  at  December  31,  2021  and  2020  was  $4.0  billion  and  $3.4  billion.  At December  31,  2021  and  2020,  the  net  fair  value  of  our  derivative  instruments  was  not  material  (see  'Note  16  -  Fair  Value Measurements' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). A 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement of our foreign currency contracts would not have a material impact on the aggregate net fair value of such contracts or our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, as we enter into foreign currency contracts to hedge foreign currency exposure on underlying transactions  we  believe  that  any  movement  on  our  foreign  currency  contracts  would  be  offset  by  movement  on  the  underlying transactions and, therefore, when taken together do not create material risk.\n\nWe evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have acceptable credit risk at the time the agreements are executed. Our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across several banks. We periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit  exposure  to  individual  counterparties. We  do  not  hold  or  issue  derivative  financial  instruments  for  trading  or  speculative purposes.\n\nWe maintain a separate trust that includes investments to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. As of December 31, 2021, investments in the trust totaled $2.1 billion and are reflected at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet in other noncurrent assets. The trust holds investments in marketable equity securities and fixed-income securities that are exposed to price changes and changes in interest rates. A portion of the liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plans supported by the trust is also impacted by changes in the market price of our common stock and certain market indices. Changes in the value of the liabilities have the effect of partially offsetting the impact of changes in the value of the trust. Both the change in the fair value of  the  trust  and  the  change  in  the  value  of  the  liabilities  are  recognized  on  our  consolidated  statements  of  earnings  in  other unallocated, net and were not material for the year ended December 31, 2021.",

      "answer": "The increase in production volume of Sikorsky helicopter programs in 2021 contributed to a $540 million increase in RMS' net sales and a $560 million increase in product costs. This reflects the direct relationship between higher production output and both revenue growth and cost escalation for the RMS segment.",

The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of $540 million for Sikorsky helicopter programs due to higher production volume (Black Hawk, CH-53K and CRH); and about $340 million for TLS programs primarily due to the delivery of an international pilot training system in the first quarter of 2021. These increases were partially offset  by  lower  net  sales  of  about  $65  million  for  integrated  warfare  systems  and  sensors (IWSS)  programs  due  to  lower  volume  on  the  LCS  and  TPQ-53  programs  that  were  partially  offset  by  higher  volume  on  the Canadian Surface Combatant (CSC) and Aegis programs.\n\nRMS' operating profit in 2021 increased $183 million, or 11%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to higher operating profit of approximately $140 million for Sikorsky helicopter programs due to higher risk retirements (Black Hawk and CH-53K), higher production volume (Black Hawk and CRH), and lower charges on the CRH program in the first half of 2021; and about $10 million for TLS programs due to the delivery of an international pilot training system in the first quarter of 2021. Operating profit for IWSS programs was comparable as lower risk retirements on the LCS program and lower volume on the TPQ53 program were offset by higher volume on the CSC program and lower charges on a ground-based radar program. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were $80 million higher in 2021 compared 2020.",

The  increase  was  primarily attributable to higher product costs of approximately $560 million at RMS due to higher production volume on various Sikorsky helicopter programs and for TLS programs due to the delivery of an international pilot training system; $435 million at Aeronautics due to higher volume on classified contracts and F-16 production contracts, partially offset by lower volume on F-35 development contracts; $345 million at MFC due to higher volume on PAC-3, LRASM and JASSM programs; partially offset by lower product costs of approximately $65 million at Space due to the renationalization of AWE, partially offset by higher volume on hypersonic development, Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) and Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next Gen OPIR) programs.\n\n## Service Costs\n\nService  costs  increased  approximately  $92  million,  or  1%,  in  2021  compared  to  2020.  The  increase  in  service  costs  was primarily  due  to  higher  service  costs  of  approximately  $85  million  at Aeronautics  due  to  higher  sustainment  volume  on  F-35, partially offset by lower sustainment volume on F-22.\n\n## Severance and Restructuring Charges\n\nDuring  2021,  we  recorded  severance  and  restructuring  charges  of  $36  million  ($28  million,  or  $0.10  per  share,  after-tax) associated  with  plans  to  close  and  consolidate  certain  facilities  and  reduce  total  workforce  within  our  RMS  business  segment. During 2020, we recorded severance charges totaling $27 million ($21 million, or $0.08 per share, after-tax) related to the planned elimination of certain positions primarily at our corporate functions.\n\n## Other Unallocated, Net\n\nOther unallocated, net primarily includes the FAS/CAS operating adjustment (which represents the difference between CAS pension cost recorded in our business segments' results of operations and the service cost component of FAS pension (expense) income), stock-based compensation expense and other corporate costs. These items are not allocated to the business segments and, therefore, are not allocated to cost of sales for products or services. Other unallocated, net reduced cost of sales by $1.8 billion in 2021,  compared  to  $1.7  billion  in  2020.  Other  unallocated,  net  during  2021  was  higher  primarily  due  to  an  increase  in  our FAS/CAS operating adjustment and fluctuations in costs associated with various corporate items, none of which were individually significant.  See  'Business  Segment  Results  of  Operations'  and  'Critical  Accounting  Policies  -  Postretirement  Benefit  Plans' discussion below for more information on our pension cost.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nOther income (expense), net generally includes earnings generated by equity method investees. Other income, net in 2021 was $62 million, compared to other expense, net of $10 million in 2020. Other income, net in 2021 included lower earnings generated by  equity  method  investments;  however,  other  expense,  net  in  2020  included  a  noncash  impairment  charge  of  $128  million ($96  million ,  or $0.34  per  share,  after-tax)  related  to  our  previous  investment  in Advanced  Military  Maintenance,  Repair  and Overhaul Center (AMMROC), which was sold in 2020. See 'Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Interest Expense\n\nInterest  expense  in  2021  was  $569  million,  compared  to  $591  million  in  2020.  The  decrease  in  interest  expense  in  2021 resulted primarily from our scheduled repayment of debt in October 2020 and September 2021 of $500 million each. See 'Capital Structure, Resources and Other' included within 'Liquidity and Cash Flows' discussion below and 'Note 11 - Debt' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our debt.\n\n## Non-Service FAS Pension (Expense) Income\n\nNon-service FAS pension expense was $1.3 billion in 2021, compared to income of $219 million in 2020. Non-service FAS pension expense in 2021 includes a noncash pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion ($1.3 billion, or $4.72 per share, after-tax), related  to  the  transfer  of  $4.9  billion  of  our  gross  defined  benefit  pension  obligations  and  related  plan  assets  to  an  insurance company.

          "chunk_text": "EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS. Equity method investments are investments in entities in which we do not have a controlling financial interest, but over which we have significant influence. Significant influence typically exists if we have a 20% to 50% ownership interest in the investee. Equity method investments are assessed for other-than-temporary impairment when events occur, or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not the fair value of the asset is below its carrying value. If a decline in the v alue of an equity  method inv estment is determined to be other than temporary, a loss is recorded in earnings in the current period. Equity method investments are recognized within A ll other assets in our Statement of Financial Position. Our share of the results of equity method investments is recognized within Other income (loss) in our Statement Earnings (Loss) since the activities of the investee are closely aligned with our operations. See Notes 9 and 26 for further information.\n\nWe enter into related party transactions with certain equity method investments, of which, the most significant are with CFM  International, a non-consolidated company jointly owned with Safran Aircraft Engines, a subsidiary of Safran Group of France. We make substantial sales of parts and services to CFM International. Related party transactions with other equity method investees primarily consist of purchases of engine parts or maintenance services, which are not significant with any single related party.\n\nGOVERNMENT INCENTIVES. We receive grants and incentives from various federal, state, local, and foreign governments in exchange for compliance with certain conditions relating to our activities in a specific jurisdiction which encourage investment, job creation and retention, and environmental objectives including emissions reductions. We recognize government grants as a reduction to the related expense or asset when there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with the conditions of the grant, the grant is received or is probable of receipt and the amount is determinable. Government grants resulted in reductions of $117 million, $99 million and $100 million to research and development expense in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nCASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH. Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash include cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term cash investment that are highly liquid in nature and have original maturities of three months or less, including debt securities and money market instruments unless classified as available-for-sale investment securities. Restricted cash primarily comprised funds restricted in connection with certain ongoing litigation matters and amounted to an insignificant amount at both December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nINVESTMENT SECURITIES. We report investments in available-for-sale debt securities and certain equity securities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are recorded to other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. Unrealized gains and losses on equity securities with readily determinable fair values are recorded to earnings.\n\nAlthough we generally do not have the intent to sell any specific debt securities in the ordinary course of managing our portfolio, we may sell debt securities prior to their maturities for a v ariety  of reasons, including div ersification, credit quality , y ield and liquidity  requirements and the funding of claims and obligations to policyholders.\n\nWe regularly review investment securities for impairment. For debt securities, if we do not intend to sell the security or it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost, we evaluate qualitative criteria, such as the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer, to determine whether we do not expect to recover the amortized cost basis of the security. We also evaluate quantitative criteria including determining whether there has been an adverse change in expected future cash flows. If we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security, we consider the security to contain an expected credit loss, and we record the difference between the security's amortized cost basis and its recoverable amount in earnings as an allowance for credit loss and the difference between the security's recoverable amount and fair value in other comprehensive income. If we intend to sell the security  or it is more likely  than not we will be required to sell the security  before recov ery  of its amortiz ed cost basis, the security  is considered impaired, and we recognize the entire difference between the security's amortized cost basis and its fair value in earnings. See Note 3 for further information.\n\nCURRENT RECEIVABLES. Amounts due from customers arising from the sales of equipment and services are recorded at the outstanding amount, less allowance for losses. We regularly monitor the recoverability of our receivables. See Note 4 for further information.\n\nALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES. When we record customer receivables and contract assets arising from revenue transactions, as well as commercial mortgage loans and reinsurance recoverables in our run-off insurance operations, financial guarantees and certain commitments, we record an allowance for credit losses for the current expected credit losses (CECL) inherent in the asset over its expected life. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account deducted from the amortized cost basis of the assets to present their net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected. Each period, the allowance for credit losses is adjusted through earnings to reflect expected credit losses over the remaining lives of the assets. We evaluate debt securities with unrealized losses to determine whether any of the losses arise from concerns about the issuer's credit or the underlying collateral and record an allowance for credit losses, if required.\n\nWe estimate expected credit losses based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. When measuring expected credit losses, we pool assets with similar country risk and credit risk characteristics. Changes in the relevant information may significantly affect the estimates of expected credit losses.\n\nINVENTORIES. All inv entories are stated at lower of cost or realiz able v alues. Cost of inv entories is primarily  determined using the av erage cost method. See Note 5 for further information.\n\n44 2024 FORM  10-K",

      "answer": "GE's relationship with CFM International positively impacted its 2024 cash flow through increased collections, which contributed to a reduction in the negative impact of current receivables on working capital. Specifically, higher collections from CFM International helped drive a $(0.9) billion impact from current receivables, which was a key component of the overall $(0.4) billion negative change in working capital for 2024.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, GE has a significant equity method investment in CFM International and engages in substantial sales of parts and services to the company.",

          "chunk_text": "EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS. Equity method investments are investments in entities in which we do not have a controlling financial interest, but over which we have significant influence. Significant influence typically exists if we have a 20% to 50% ownership interest in the investee. Equity method investments are assessed for other-than-temporary impairment when events occur, or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not the fair value of the asset is below its carrying value. If a decline in the v alue of an equity  method inv estment is determined to be other than temporary, a loss is recorded in earnings in the current period. Equity method investments are recognized within A ll other assets in our Statement of Financial Position. Our share of the results of equity method investments is recognized within Other income (loss) in our Statement Earnings (Loss) since the activities of the investee are closely aligned with our operations. See Notes 9 and 26 for further information.\n\nWe enter into related party transactions with certain equity method investments, of which, the most significant are with CFM  International, a non-consolidated company jointly owned with Safran Aircraft Engines, a subsidiary of Safran Group of France. We make substantial sales of parts and services to CFM International. Related party transactions with other equity method investees primarily consist of purchases of engine parts or maintenance services, which are not significant with any single related party.\n\nGOVERNMENT INCENTIVES. We receive grants and incentives from various federal, state, local, and foreign governments in exchange for compliance with certain conditions relating to our activities in a specific jurisdiction which encourage investment, job creation and retention, and environmental objectives including emissions reductions. We recognize government grants as a reduction to the related expense or asset when there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with the conditions of the grant, the grant is received or is probable of receipt and the amount is determinable. Government grants resulted in reductions of $117 million, $99 million and $100 million to research and development expense in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nCASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH. Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash include cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term cash investment that are highly liquid in nature and have original maturities of three months or less, including debt securities and money market instruments unless classified as available-for-sale investment securities. Restricted cash primarily comprised funds restricted in connection with certain ongoing litigation matters and amounted to an insignificant amount at both December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nINVESTMENT SECURITIES. We report investments in available-for-sale debt securities and certain equity securities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are recorded to other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. Unrealized gains and losses on equity securities with readily determinable fair values are recorded to earnings.\n\nAlthough we generally do not have the intent to sell any specific debt securities in the ordinary course of managing our portfolio, we may sell debt securities prior to their maturities for a v ariety  of reasons, including div ersification, credit quality , y ield and liquidity  requirements and the funding of claims and obligations to policyholders.\n\nWe regularly review investment securities for impairment.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## 21. Guarantees and product warranty\n\nWe have provided various guarantees that have varying terms and limit potential payment. Under the guarantees, non-performance by the third parties could require  Caterpillar  to  satisfy  the  contractual  obligation  by  providing  goods,  services  or  financial  compensation.  The  max imum  potential  amount  of  future payments (undiscounted and without reduction for any amounts possibly recoverable) that we could be required to make under the guarantees was $368 million and $353 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nWe have dealer performance guarantees and third-party performance guarantees that do not limit potential payment to end users related to indemnities and other commercial contractual obligations. In addition, we have entered into contracts involving industry standard indemnifications that do not limit potential payment. For these unlimited guarantees, we are unable to estimate a maximum potential amount of future payments that could result from claims made.\n\nNo significant loss has been experienced or is anticipated under any of these guarantees.\n\nCat Financial provides guarantees to purchase certain loans of Caterpillar dealers from a special-purpose corporation (SPC) that qualifies as a variable interest entity.  Cat Financial receives a fee for providing this guarantee. The purpose of the SPC is to provide short-term working capital loans to Caterpillar dealers. This SPC issues commercial paper and uses the proceeds to fund its loan program.  Cat Financial is the primary beneficiary of the SPC as its guarantees result in Cat Financial having both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the SPC's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses, and therefore Cat Financial has consolidated the financial statements of the SPC.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the SPC's assets of $1.14 billion and $1.35 billion, respectively, were primarily comprised of loans to dealers, and the SPC's liabilities of $1.14 billion and $1.35 billion, respectively, were primarily comprised of commercial paper.  The assets of the SPC are not available to pay Cat Financial's creditors.  Cat Financial may be obligated to perform under the guarantee if the SPC experiences losses. No loss has been experienced or is anticipated under this loan purchase agreement.\n\nCat Financial has commitments to extend credit to customers through lines of credit and other pre-approved credit arrangements. Cat Financial applies the same credit policies and approval process for these commitments as we do for other financing. Collateral is not required, but if credit is ex tended, collateral is generally required upon funding. The unused commitments to extend credit to customers that are not unconditionally cancellable was $843 million at December 31, 2024. Cat Financial also has pre-approved lines of credit and other credit arrangements with Caterpillar dealers; however, we generally have the right to unconditionally cancel, alter, or amend the terms at any time.\n\nWe determine our product warranty liability by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory.  G enerally, we base historical claim rates on actual warranty experience for each product by machine model/engine size by customer or dealer location (inside or outside North America).  We develop specific rates for each product shipment month and update them monthly based on actual warranty claim experience.\n\nThe reconciliation of the change in our product warranty liability balances for the years ended December 31, was as follows:\n\n",

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Product Warranty Liability\n\nAs described in Notes 2 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's product warranty liability as of December 31, 2024 was $1,700 million. At the time  the  Company  recognizes  a  sale,  management  records  estimated  future  warranty  costs.  Management  determines  the  product  warranty  liability  by  applying historical claim rate ex perience to the current field population and dealer inventory. G enerally, management bases historical claim rates on actual warranty ex perience for each product by machine model/engine size by customer or dealer location (inside or outside North America). Management develops specific rates for each product shipment month and updates them monthly based on actual warranty claim experience.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the product warranty liability is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the estimate of the product warranty liability, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management's significant assumption related to historical claim rates, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's estimate of the product warranty liability. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data provided by management and (ii) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimate by performing one or a combination of procedures, including (a) developing  an  independent  actuarial  estimate  of  the  product  warranty  liability,  and  comparing  the  independent  estimate  to  management's  actuarial  determined liability; and (b) evaluating the appropriateness of management's actuarial methodologies and the reasonableness of management's significant assumption related to historical claim rates.\n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Dallas, Texas February 14, 2025\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1925.",

      "question": "How does Honeywell's use of the cost-to-cost input method for long-term contracts influence the complexity of its audit procedures, particularly in relation to the estimation of contract costs and the recognition of revenue over time?",
      "answer": "Honeywell's use of the cost-to-cost input method for long-term contracts significantly increases the complexity of its audit procedures because it requires extensive auditor judgment to evaluate the reasonableness and consistency of management's estimates of total contract costs and progress toward completion. Given that contract costs can span several years and are influenced by factors such as inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, subcontractor performance, and labor agreements, auditors must perform detailed procedures to test controls, validate assumptions, and profile contracts with longer durations or significant gross margin changes. This complexity is further heightened by the fact that revenue recognition under this method depends on the proportion of costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs, which can lead to material adjustments if estimates change over time.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The audit of long-term contracts involves a high degree of auditor judgment due to the significance of management's estimates of contract costs, which vary depending on the length of the contract and are influenced by factors such as inflation, technical risk, subcontractor performance, and labor agreements.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Honeywell recognizes revenue over time using the cost-to-cost input method, which measures progress toward completion based on the proportion of costs incurred to total estimated costs. This method requires ongoing estimation and monitoring of both revenue and costs, with changes recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The use of the cost-to-cost input method inherently introduces complexity in financial reporting due to the need for continuous estimation and adjustment of contract costs and revenues. This directly influences the audit process, requiring extensive procedures to validate the assumptions and controls around these estimates, as detailed in both evidence sources."

      "question": "How does GE's retained exposure to Bank BPH's mortgage portfolio in Poland, as part of its run-off financial services operations, impact its liquidity risk and capital allocation strategy as disclosed in the 2023 10-K filing?",
      "answer": "GE's retained exposure to Bank BPH's mortgage portfolio in Poland creates liquidity risk because adverse developments could lead to capital contributions to its insurance subsidiaries, which affects its liquidity position and capital allocation strategy. In 2023, GE reported $17.0 billion in total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, with $14.2 billion held outside the U.S., but $0.8 billion of cash was tied up in run-off Insurance operations, limiting its availability for general operations. This exposure could increase policy benefit reserves and require additional capital contributions, which would constrain GE's ability to maintain a disciplined financial policy and allocate capital to other strategic initiatives.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - GE retains significant exposure to legacy financial services, including the Bank BPH mortgage portfolio in Poland, which could require future capital contributions due to adverse developments or statutory reserve testing.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - GE reported $17.0 billion in total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at the end of 2023, with $0.8 billion of that amount held in run-off Insurance operations, which is not available for general funding.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The retained exposure to Bank BPH's mortgage portfolio introduces liquidity risk because potential future capital contributions could draw on already constrained liquidity resources, especially since $0.8 billion of cash is already tied up in run-off insurance operations. This affects GE's ability to maintain liquidity under stress and influences its capital allocation decisions."

      "answer": "The potential increase in contingent liabilities from Bank BPH's ongoing litigation in Poland could negatively impact GE's liquidity position. GE reported total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $17.0 billion at December 31, 2023. However, $14.2 billion of this amount was held outside the U.S., with $1.7 billion in countries with currency control restrictions. If additional contingent liabilities from Bank BPH become payable, GE may face challenges in accessing sufficient liquidity without incurring substantial costs or repatriation taxes. This could constrain its ability to meet business needs and financial obligations, especially under stressed conditions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Additional contingent liabilities and loss estimates for Bank BPH may need to be recognized and will become payable, which could materially and adversely affect GE's financial position.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - GE reported $17.0 billion in total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at the end of 2023, with $14.2 billion held outside the U.S. and $1.7 billion in countries with currency controls.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - If Bank BPH's contingent liabilities increase and become payable, GE may struggle to access sufficient liquidity due to geographic cash restrictions, which could impair its ability to meet obligations and maintain operations."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nLegal Matters. As previously  announced,  in  2024  the  Company  resolved  several  outstanding  legal  matters,  herein  referred  to  as  'Resolution  of  Certain  Legal Matters.'  The  Company  entered  into  a  deferred  prosecution  agreement  (DPA)  (DPA-1)  with  the  Department  of  Justice  (DOJ)  and  the  Company  settled  an administrative proceeding with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) (the SEC Administrative Order) to resolve the previously disclosed criminal and civil government investigations into payments made by Raytheon Company and its joint venture, Thales-Raytheon Systems (TRS), in connection with certain Middle East contracts since 2012 (Thales-Raytheon Systems and Related Matters). The Company also entered into a DPA and a False Claims Act (FCA) settlement agreement with  the  DOJ  to  resolve  previously  disclosed  criminal  and  civil  government  investigations  into  defective  pricing  claims  for  certain  legacy  Raytheon  Company contracts entered into between 2011 and 2013 and in 2017 (DOJ Investigation and Contract Pricing Disputes). Under these DPAs and the SEC Administrative Order, Raytheon Company and the Company are required to retain, among other things, an independent compliance monitor satisfactory to the DOJ and the SEC (for a term ending  three  years  from  the  date  on  which  the  monitor  is  engaged)  and  are  required  to  undertake  certain  cooperation  and  disclosure  obligations  (for  a  term commencing on the effective date of DPA-1 and the SEC Administrative Order, as applicable, and ending three years from the date on which the monitor is engaged). The  compliance  monitor  will  oversee  Raytheon  Company's  and  the  Company's  compliance  with  their  respective  obligations  under  the  DPAs  and  the  SEC Administrative  Order.  The  DPAs further provide that, in the event the  DOJ, in its sole discretion, determines during the period of deferral of prosecution that Raytheon Company or the Company have violated any provision of either DPA, Raytheon Company or the Company may be subject to prosecution for any federal criminal violation, including the charges against Raytheon Company in the relevant DPA. The SEC Administrative Order further provides that, in the event of a breach of the SEC Administrative Order, the SEC may vacate the SEC Administrative Order and institute proceedings against the Company. In the event of any such determination  or  breach,  the  Company  may  face  additional  adverse  impacts.  In  addition,  the  Company  resolved  certain  voluntarily  disclosed  ex port  controls violations primarily identified in connection with the integration of Rockwell Collins and, to a lesser ex tent, Raytheon Company, including certain violations that were resolved pursuant to a Consent Agreement (CA) with the Department of State (DOS) (Trade Compliance Matters). The CA, which has a three-year term, requires the Company  to  implement  remedial  compliance  measures  and  to  conduct  an  external  audit  of  the  Company's  International  Traffic  in  Arms  Regulations  (ITAR) compliance program. The CA also requires appointment of an external, independent Special Compliance Officer (SCO). The Company appointed its SCO on September 27, 2024. As a result of the DPAs, SEC Administrative Order, FCA settlement agreement and CA, we recorded a combined pre-tax charge of $918 million during the second quarter of 2024, which included $269 million related to the DOJ Investigation and Contract Pricing Disputes (in addition to amounts previously accrued), $364 million related to Thales-Raytheon Systems and Related Matters (in addition to amounts previously accrued), and $285 million related to Trade Compliance Matters. In the fourth quarter we made payments of $580 million related to the DOJ Investigation and Contract Pricing Dispute and $384 million related to Thales-Raytheon Systems and Related Matters. See 'Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies' within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\n\nPratt &amp; Whitney Powder Metal Matter. In 2023, Pratt &amp; Whitney determined that a rare condition in powder metal used to manufacture certain engine parts requires accelerated inspection of the PW1100G -JM (PW1100) G eared Turbofan (GTF) fleet, which powers the A320neo family of aircraft (A320neo) (herein referred to as the 'Powder Metal Matter'). See 'Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies' within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\n\nGlobal Supply Chain. We are dependent on a global supply chain and have experienced supply chain disruptions that resulted in delays and increased costs and adversely affected our performance. These disruptions impacted our ability to procure raw materials, microelectronics, and certain commodities on a timely basis and/or at expected prices, and are driven by supply chain market constraints and macroeconomic conditions, including inflation and labor market shortages. Current geopolitical  conditions,  including  conflicts  and  other  causes  of  strained  intercountry  relations,  as  well  as  sanctions  and  other  trade  restrictive  activities,  are contributing to these issues. Furthermore, our suppliers and subcontractors have been impacted by these same issues. We have implemented actions and programs to mitigate some of the impacts but anticipate supply chain disruptions to continue.\n\nEconomic Environment. The inflationary environment has increased material and component prices, labor rates, and supplier costs and has negatively impacted our performance, including our productivity expectations. Due to the nature of our government and commercial aerospace businesses, and their respective customer and supplier contracts, we are not always able to offset cost increases by increasing our contract value or pricing, in particular on our fixed-price contracts. Increasing material, component, and labor prices could subject us to losses in our fixed price contracts in the event of cost overruns. In addition, higher interest rates have increased the cost of borrowing and tightened the availability of capital. Among other things, these effects can constrain our customers' purchasing power and decrease orders for our products and services and impact the ability of our customers to make payments and our suppliers to perform. Moreover, volatility in interest rates and financial markets can lead to economic uncertainty, an economic downturn or recession, and impact the demand for our products and services as well as our supply chain. We continue to pursue strategic and operational initiatives to help address these macroeconomic pressures, including our digital transformation, operational modernization, cost reduction, and advanced",

Any failure by us, our customers, or our suppliers to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties, fines, seizure of our products, adverse publicity, restrictions on our ability to engage in ex port or import transactions, or the suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government.\n\nFor further discussion of risks related to ex ports and imports, see Item 1A. 'Risk Factors'.\n\nCompliance Matters. As previously disclosed, on October 15, 2024, Raytheon Company entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) (DPA-1) with the DOJ and on October 16, 2024, the Company became subject to an administrative order issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) (the SEC Administrative Order) to resolve the previously disclosed criminal and civil government investigations into payments made by Raytheon Company and its joint venture, ThalesRaytheon Systems (TRS), since 2012 in connection with certain Middle East contracts. On October 16, 2024, Raytheon Company also entered into a DPA (DPA-2) and a False Claims Act (FCA) settlement agreement with the DOJ to resolve previously disclosed criminal and civil government investigations into defective pricing claims for certain legacy Raytheon Company contracts entered into between 2011 and 2013 and in 2017. Under DPA-1, DPA-2, and the SEC Administrative Order, Raytheon Company and the Company are required, among other things, to retain an independent compliance monitor satisfactory to the DOJ and the SEC (for a term ending  three  years  from  the  date  on  which  the  monitor  is  engaged)  and  are  required  to  undertake  certain  cooperation  and  disclosure  obligations  (for  a  term commencing on the effective date of DPA-1 and the SEC Administrative Order, as applicable, and ending three years from the date on which the monitor is engaged). The compliance monitor will oversee Raytheon Company's and the Company's compliance with their respective obligations under DPA-1, DPA-2, and the SEC's Administrative Order. DPA-1 and DPA-2 further provide that, in the event the DOJ, in its sole discretion, determines during the period of deferral of prosecution that Raytheon Company or the Company have violated any provision of either DPA, Raytheon Company or the Company may be subject to prosecution for any federal criminal violation, including the charges against Raytheon Company in the relevant DPA. The SEC Administrative Order further provides that, in the event of a breach of the agreement with the SEC, the SEC may vacate the Administrative Order and institute proceedings against the Company. In the event of any such determination of breach, the Company may face additional adverse impacts.\n\nAlso as previously disclosed, on August 29, 2024, the Company entered into a Consent Agreement (CA) with the DOS to resolve alleged civil violations of the AECA and the ITAR. The CA, which has a three-year term, requires the Company to implement remedial compliance measures and to conduct an external audit of the Company's ITAR compliance program. The CA also requires appointment of an external independent Special Compliance Officer (SCO). The Company appointed its SCO on September 27, 2024. If the Company is unable to satisfy the requirements of the CA within three years as determined by the DOS, it may face a continuation of the CA, additional fines, or other adverse impacts.\n\nFor further discussion of DPA-1, DPA-2, the SEC Administrative Order, and the CA, see Item 7. 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,' Item 1A. 'Risk Factors,' and 'Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies' within Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\n\nEnvironmental Regulation. Our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal, state, and local authorities in the U.S. and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our international operations, including with respect to chemical substances in our products, manufacturing processes, and the operation  of  our  facilities,  as  well  as  the  generation,  treatment,  storage,  disposal,  and  remediation  of  hazardous  substances  and  wastes.  We  use  hazardous substances and generate hazardous wastes in some of our operations and have incurred, and will likely continue to incur, costs associated with environmental compliance activities and management of remediation matters at sites with pollutants. A portion of these costs are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of our  products  and  services  under  our  contracts  with  the  U.S.  government.  In  addition,  we  have  been  identified  as  a  potentially  responsible  party  under  the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, also known as the Superfund law, or state law counterparts to the Superfund law, for a number of sites. The nature and extent of environmental concerns vary from site to site and our share of responsibility varies from sole responsibility to very little responsibility. We also manage various government-owned facilities on behalf of the U.S. government. At such facilities, environmental compliance and remediation costs have historically been primarily the responsibility of the U.S. government, and we have relied upon U.S. government funding to pay such costs. We do not anticipate that compliance with current provisions or requirements relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments we may be required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. Environmental matters are further addressed in 'Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles' and 'Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies' within Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\n\nMost of the U.S. laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions. If we were convicted of a violation of the federal Clean Air Act or Clean Water Act, the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be deemed ineligible to be used in performing any U.S. government contract we are awarded until the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) thereafter certifies that the condition giving rise to the violation has been corrected.",

RTX's chief operating decision maker (CODM) is our President and Chief Executive Officer. The CODM uses segment operating profit as a profitability measure to assess actual and forecasted segment performance to make decisions regarding incentive compensation and the allocation of capital and other investments. Total net sales and operating profit (loss) by segment include inter-segment sales which are generally recorded at cost-plus a specified fee or at a negotiated fixed price. These pricing arrangements may result in margins different than what the purchasing segment realizes on the ultimate third-party sales.\n\nWe present a FAS/CAS operating adjustment outside of segment results, which represents the difference between the service cost component of our pension and PRB  expense  under  the  Financial Accounting  Standards  (FAS)  requirements  of  U.S.  GAAP  and  our  pension  and  PRB  expense  under  U.S.  government  Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) primarily related to our Raytheon segment. While the ultimate liability for pension and PRB costs under FAS and CAS is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. Over time, we generally ex pect to recover the related Raytheon pension and PRB liabilities through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. Collins and Pratt &amp; Whitney generally record pension and PRB expense on a FAS basis.\n\nAcquisition  accounting  adjustments  include  the  amortization  of  acquired  intangible  assets  related  to  acquisitions,  the  amortization  of  the  property,  plant,  and equipment fair value adjustment acquired through acquisitions, the amortization of customer contractual obligations related to loss-making or below-market contracts acquired, and goodwill impairment, if applicable.

RTX's chief operating decision maker (CODM) is our President and Chief Executive Officer. The CODM uses segment operating profit as a profitability measure to assess actual and forecasted segment performance to make decisions regarding incentive compensation and the allocation of capital and other investments. Total net sales and operating profit (loss) by segment include inter-segment sales which are generally recorded at cost-plus a specified fee or at a negotiated fixed price. These pricing arrangements may result in margins different than what the purchasing segment realizes on the ultimate third-party sales.\n\nWe present a FAS/CAS operating adjustment outside of segment results, which represents the difference between the service cost component of our pension and PRB  expense  under  the  Financial Accounting  Standards  (FAS)  requirements  of  U.S.  GAAP  and  our  pension  and  PRB  expense  under  U.S.  government  Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) primarily related to our Raytheon segment. While the ultimate liability for pension and PRB costs under FAS and CAS is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. Over time, we generally ex pect to recover the related Raytheon pension and PRB liabilities through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. Collins and Pratt &amp; Whitney generally record pension and PRB expense on a FAS basis.\n\nAcquisition  accounting  adjustments  include  the  amortization  of  acquired  intangible  assets  related  to  acquisitions,  the  amortization  of  the  property,  plant,  and equipment fair value adjustment acquired through acquisitions, the amortization of customer contractual obligations related to loss-making or below-market contracts acquired, and goodwill impairment, if applicable. These adjustments are not considered part of management's evaluation of segment results.",

      "question": "How much would RTX's net periodic benefit income have changed in 2024 if a 25 basis point adjustment to the EROA occurred, and how does this tie into the compliance obligations RTX faces under the SEC Administrative Order?",
      "answer": "RTX's net periodic benefit income in 2024 would have changed by approximately $131 million for every 25 basis point increase or decrease in the Expected Return on Asset Obligations (EROA). This financial sensitivity is directly tied to the company's long-term investment assumptions and pension accounting. Under the SEC Administrative Order, RTX must maintain strict compliance monitoring for three years, including cooperation obligations and oversight by an independent compliance monitor. This regulatory scrutiny could impact RTX's ability to manage pension assets and adjust assumptions like the EROA without triggering further regulatory or financial scrutiny, making the $131 million sensitivity not just an accounting metric, but a risk factor under ongoing compliance obligations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - RTX states that a 25 basis point change in the EROA would have changed 2024 net periodic benefit income by approximately $131 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - RTX is subject to the SEC Administrative Order, which requires the retention of an independent compliance monitor for three years and imposes cooperation and disclosure obligations.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The $131 million sensitivity to EROA changes affects how RTX manages pension assets, which must now be done under the oversight of a compliance monitor due to the SEC Administrative Order. This creates a financial and operational constraint on the company's pension management practices."

          "chunk_text": "\nThe discount rate sensitivities assume no change in the shape of the yield curve that will be applied to the projected cash outflows for future benefit payments in order to calculate interest and service cost. A flattening of the yield curve results in a narrowing of the spread between interest and obligation discount rates and would decrease our net periodic benefit income. Conversely, a steepening of the yield curve would result in an increase in the spread between interest and obligation discount rates and would increase our net periodic benefit income.\n\nThe EROA is the average rate of earnings expected over the long-term on assets invested to fund anticipated future benefit payment obligations. In determining the EROA assumption, we consider the target asset allocation of plan assets, as well as economic and other indicators of future performance. We consult with and consider  the  opinions  of  financial  and  other  professionals  in  determining  the  appropriate  capital  market  assumptions.  Return  projections  are  validated  using  a simulation model that incorporates yield curves, credit spreads, and risk premiums to project long-term prospective returns. Differences between actual asset returns in a given year and the EROA do not necessarily indicate a change in the assumption is required, as the EROA represents the expected average returns over a longterm horizon.\n\nNet periodic benefit income is also sensitive to changes in the EROA. An increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the EROA would have increased or decreased our 2024 Net periodic benefit income by approximately $131 million.\n\nRefer to 'Note 10: Employee Benefit Plans' within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for discussion of current and prior year discount rate and EROA assumptions.\n\n## ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\n\nFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see the Accounting Pronouncements section in 'Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles' within Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\n\n## COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\n\nRefer to 'Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies' within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for discussion on contractual commitments and contingencies.\n\n## GOVERNMENT MATTERS\n\nAs described above in 'Critical Accounting Estimates-Contingent Liabilities,' our contracts with the  U.S. government are subject to audits.  Such audits may recommend that certain contract prices should be reduced to comply with various government regulations, or that certain payments be delayed or withheld. We are also the subject of one or more investigations and legal proceedings initiated by the U.S. government with respect to government contract matters. In addition, as described in 'Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles' within Item 8 of this Form 10-K, in 2024, the Company entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the DOJ and the Company settled an administrative proceeding with the SEC (the SEC Administrative Order) to resolve the previously disclosed criminal and civil government investigations into payments made by Raytheon Company and its joint venture, Thales-Raytheon Systems (TRS) since 2012, in connection with certain Middle East contracts. The Company also entered into a DPA and a FCA settlement agreement with the DOJ to resolve previously disclosed criminal and civil government investigations into defective pricing claims for certain legacy Raytheon Company contracts entered into between 2011 and 2013 and in 2017. Under these DPAs and the SEC Administrative Order, Raytheon Company and the Company are required to retain, among other things, an independent compliance monitor satisfactory to the DOJ and the SEC (for a term ending three years from the date on which the monitor is engaged) and are required to undertake certain cooperation and disclosure obligations (for a term commencing on the effective date of DPA-1 and the SEC Administrative Order, as applicable, and ending three years from the date on which the monitor is engaged). The compliance monitor will oversee Raytheon Company's and the Company's compliance with their respective obligations under the DPAs and the SEC Administrative Order. In 2024, the Company also resolved certain voluntarily disclosed export controls violations primarily identified in connection with the integration of Rockwell Collins and, to a lesser ex tent, Raytheon Company, including certain violations that were resolved pursuant to a Consent Agreement (CA) with the DOS. The CA, which has a three-year term, requires the Company to implement remedial compliance measures and to conduct an external audit of the Company's ITAR compliance program. The CA also requires appointment of an external, independent Special Compliance",

'Risk Factors'.\n\nCompliance Matters. As previously disclosed, on October 15, 2024, Raytheon Company entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) (DPA-1) with the DOJ and on October 16, 2024, the Company became subject to an administrative order issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) (the SEC Administrative Order) to resolve the previously disclosed criminal and civil government investigations into payments made by Raytheon Company and its joint venture, ThalesRaytheon Systems (TRS), since 2012 in connection with certain Middle East contracts. On October 16, 2024, Raytheon Company also entered into a DPA (DPA-2) and a False Claims Act (FCA) settlement agreement with the DOJ to resolve previously disclosed criminal and civil government investigations into defective pricing claims for certain legacy Raytheon Company contracts entered into between 2011 and 2013 and in 2017. Under DPA-1, DPA-2, and the SEC Administrative Order, Raytheon Company and the Company are required, among other things, to retain an independent compliance monitor satisfactory to the DOJ and the SEC (for a term ending  three  years  from  the  date  on  which  the  monitor  is  engaged)  and  are  required  to  undertake  certain  cooperation  and  disclosure  obligations  (for  a  term commencing on the effective date of DPA-1 and the SEC Administrative Order, as applicable, and ending three years from the date on which the monitor is engaged). The compliance monitor will oversee Raytheon Company's and the Company's compliance with their respective obligations under DPA-1, DPA-2, and the SEC's Administrative Order. DPA-1 and DPA-2 further provide that, in the event the DOJ, in its sole discretion, determines during the period of deferral of prosecution that Raytheon Company or the Company have violated any provision of either DPA, Raytheon Company or the Company may be subject to prosecution for any federal criminal violation, including the charges against Raytheon Company in the relevant DPA. The SEC Administrative Order further provides that, in the event of a breach of the agreement with the SEC, the SEC may vacate the Administrative Order and institute proceedings against the Company. In the event of any such determination of breach, the Company may face additional adverse impacts.\n\nAlso as previously disclosed, on August 29, 2024, the Company entered into a Consent Agreement (CA) with the DOS to resolve alleged civil violations of the AECA and the ITAR. The CA, which has a three-year term, requires the Company to implement remedial compliance measures and to conduct an external audit of the Company's ITAR compliance program. The CA also requires appointment of an external independent Special Compliance Officer (SCO). The Company appointed its SCO on September 27, 2024. If the Company is unable to satisfy the requirements of the CA within three years as determined by the DOS, it may face a continuation of the CA, additional fines, or other adverse impacts.\n\nFor further discussion of DPA-1, DPA-2, the SEC Administrative Order, and the CA, see Item 7. 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,' Item 1A. 'Risk Factors,' and 'Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies' within Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\n\nEnvironmental Regulation. Our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal, state, and local authorities in the U.S. and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our international operations, including with respect to chemical substances in our products, manufacturing processes, and the operation  of  our  facilities,  as  well  as  the  generation,  treatment,  storage,  disposal,  and  remediation  of  hazardous  substances  and  wastes.  We  use  hazardous substances and generate hazardous wastes in some of our operations and have incurred, and will likely continue to incur, costs associated with environmental compliance activities and management of remediation matters at sites with pollutants. A portion of these costs are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of our  products  and  services  under  our  contracts  with  the  U.S.  government.  In  addition,  we  have  been  identified  as  a  potentially  responsible  party  under  the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, also known as the Superfund law, or state law counterparts to the Superfund law, for a number of sites. The nature and extent of environmental concerns vary from site to site and our share of responsibility varies from sole responsibility to very little responsibility. We also manage various government-owned facilities on behalf of the U.S. government. At such facilities, environmental compliance and remediation costs have historically been primarily the responsibility of the U.S. government, and we have relied upon U.S. government funding to pay such costs. We do not anticipate that compliance with current provisions or requirements relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments we may be required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. Environmental matters are further addressed in 'Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles' and 'Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies' within Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\n\nMost of the U.S. laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions. If we were convicted of a violation of the federal Clean Air Act or Clean Water Act, the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be deemed ineligible to be used in performing any U.S. government contract we are awarded until the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) thereafter certifies that the condition giving rise to the violation has been corrected.",

As previously announced, in 2024 the  Company resolved several outstanding legal  matters,  herein  referred  to  as  'Resolution  of  Certain  Legal Matters.'  The  Company  entered  into  a  deferred  prosecution  agreement  (DPA)  (DPA-1)  with  the  Department  of  Justice  (DOJ)  and  the  Company  settled  an administrative proceeding with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) (the SEC Administrative Order) to resolve the previously disclosed criminal and civil government investigations into payments made by Raytheon Company and its joint venture, Thales-Raytheon Systems (TRS), in connection with certain Middle East contracts since 2012 (Thales-Raytheon Systems and Related Matters). The Company also entered into a DPA and a False Claims Act (FCA) settlement agreement with  the  DOJ  to  resolve  previously  disclosed  criminal  and  civil  government  investigations  into  defective  pricing  claims  for  certain  legacy  Raytheon  Company contracts entered into between 2011 and 2013 and in 2017 (DOJ Investigation and Contract Pricing Disputes). Under these DPAs and the SEC Administrative Order, Raytheon Company and the Company are required to retain, among other things, an independent compliance monitor satisfactory to the DOJ and the SEC (for a term ending  three  years  from  the  date  on  which  the  monitor  is  engaged)  and  are  required  to  undertake  certain  cooperation  and  disclosure  obligations  (for  a  term commencing on the effective date of DPA-1 and the SEC Administrative Order, as applicable, and ending three years from the date on which the monitor is engaged). The  compliance  monitor  will  oversee  Raytheon  Company's  and  the  Company's  compliance  with  their  respective  obligations  under  the  DPAs  and  the  SEC Administrative  Order.  The  DPAs further provide that, in the event the  DOJ, in its sole discretion, determines during the period of deferral of prosecution that Raytheon Company or the Company have violated any provision of either DPA, Raytheon Company or the Company may be subject to prosecution for any federal criminal violation, including the charges against Raytheon Company in the relevant DPA. The SEC Administrative Order further provides that, in the event of a breach of the SEC Administrative Order, the SEC may vacate the SEC Administrative Order and institute proceedings against the Company. In the event of any such determination  or  breach,  the  Company  may  face  additional  adverse  impacts.  In  addition,  the  Company  resolved  certain  voluntarily  disclosed  ex port  controls violations primarily identified in connection with the integration of Rockwell Collins and, to a lesser ex tent, Raytheon Company, including certain violations that were resolved pursuant to a Consent Agreement (CA) with the Department of State (DOS) (Trade Compliance Matters). The CA, which has a three-year term, requires the Company  to  implement  remedial  compliance  measures  and  to  conduct  an  external  audit  of  the  Company's  International  Traffic  in  Arms  Regulations  (ITAR) compliance program. The CA also requires appointment of an external, independent Special Compliance Officer (SCO). The Company appointed its SCO on September 27, 2024. As a result of the DPAs, SEC Administrative Order, FCA settlement agreement and CA, we recorded a combined pre-tax charge of $ 918 million during the second quarter of 2024, which included $269 million related to the DOJ Investigation and Contract Pricing Disputes (in addition to amounts previously accrued), $364 million related to Thales-Raytheon Systems and Related Matters (in addition to amounts previously accrued), and $285 million related to Trade Compliance Matters. In the fourth quarter we made payments of $580 million related to the DOJ Investigation and Contract Pricing Dispute and $384 million related to Thales-Raytheon Systems and Related Matters. See 'Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies' for additional information.\n\nRussia Sanctions. In response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. government and the governments of various jurisdictions in which we operate, have imposed broad economic sanctions and export controls targeting specific industries, entities, and individuals in Russia. The Russian government has implemented similar counter-sanctions and export controls targeting specific industries, entities, and individuals in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate, including certain members of the Company's management team and Board of Directors. These government measures, among other limitations, restrict transactions involving various Russian banks and financial institutions and impose enhanced export controls limiting transfers of various goods, software, and technologies to and from Russia, including broadened export controls specifically targeting the aerospace sector. These measures have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, the Company and/or our supply chain, business partners, or customers. As a result of the Canadian government's imposition of sanctions in February 2024, including those imposed on U.S.- and German-based Russian-owned entities from which we source titanium for use in our Canadian operations, we recorded charges of $175 million in the first quarter of 2024 within our Collins Aerospace",

Under DPA-1, DPA-2, and the SEC Administrative Order, Raytheon Company and the Company are required, among other things, to retain an independent compliance monitor satisfactory to the DOJ and the SEC (for a term ending  three  years  from  the  date  on  which  the  monitor  is  engaged)  and  are  required  to  undertake  certain  cooperation  and  disclosure  obligations  (for  a  term commencing on the effective date of DPA-1 and the SEC Administrative Order, as applicable, and ending three years from the date on which the monitor is engaged). The compliance monitor will oversee Raytheon Company's and the Company's compliance with their respective obligations under DPA-1, DPA-2, and the SEC's Administrative Order. DPA-1 and DPA-2 further provide that, in the event the DOJ, in its sole discretion, determines during the period of deferral of prosecution that Raytheon Company or the Company have violated any provision of either DPA, Raytheon Company or the Company may be subject to prosecution for any federal criminal violation, including the charges against Raytheon Company in the relevant DPA. The SEC Administrative Order further provides that, in the event of a breach of the agreement with the SEC, the SEC may vacate the Administrative Order and institute proceedings against the Company. In the event of any such determination of breach, the Company may face additional adverse impacts.\n\nAlso as previously disclosed, on August 29, 2024, the Company entered into a Consent Agreement (CA) with the DOS to resolve alleged civil violations of the AECA and the ITAR. The CA, which has a three-year term, requires the Company to implement remedial compliance measures and to conduct an external audit of the Company's ITAR compliance program. The CA also requires appointment of an external independent Special Compliance Officer (SCO). The Company appointed its SCO on September 27, 2024. If the Company is unable to satisfy the requirements of the CA within three years as determined by the DOS, it may face a continuation of the CA, additional fines, or other adverse impacts.\n\nFor further discussion of DPA-1, DPA-2, the SEC Administrative Order, and the CA, see Item 7. 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,' Item 1A. 'Risk Factors,' and 'Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies' within Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\n\nEnvironmental Regulation. Our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal, state, and local authorities in the U.S. and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our international operations, including with respect to chemical substances in our products, manufacturing processes, and the operation  of  our  facilities,  as  well  as  the  generation,  treatment,  storage,  disposal,  and  remediation  of  hazardous  substances  and  wastes.  We  use  hazardous substances and generate hazardous wastes in some of our operations and have incurred, and will likely continue to incur, costs associated with environmental compliance activities and management of remediation matters at sites with pollutants. A portion of these costs are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of our  products  and  services  under  our  contracts  with  the  U.S.  government.  In  addition,  we  have  been  identified  as  a  potentially  responsible  party  under  the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, also known as the Superfund law, or state law counterparts to the Superfund law, for a number of sites. The nature and extent of environmental concerns vary from site to site and our share of responsibility varies from sole responsibility to very little responsibility. We also manage various government-owned facilities on behalf of the U.S. government. At such facilities, environmental compliance and remediation costs have historically been primarily the responsibility of the U.S. government, and we have relied upon U.S. government funding to pay such costs. We do not anticipate that compliance with current provisions or requirements relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments we may be required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. Environmental matters are further addressed in 'Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles' and 'Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies' within Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\n\nMost of the U.S. laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions. If we were convicted of a violation of the federal Clean Air Act or Clean Water Act, the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be deemed ineligible to be used in performing any U.S. government contract we are awarded until the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) thereafter certifies that the condition giving rise to the violation has been corrected.",

      "answer": "RTX's SEC Administrative Order, announced on October 16, 2024, increases its exposure to legal and reputational risks because any violation of the order could lead to the SEC instituting proceedings against the company, potentially resulting in additional penalties and reputational harm. This aligns with RTX's stated risk factors that highlight the potential for suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting and reputational damage due to legal proceedings or investigations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - RTX became subject to an SEC Administrative Order on October 16, 2024, and any breach could result in the SEC instituting proceedings, leading to additional penalties and reputational harm.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - RTX acknowledges risks related to the SEC Administrative Order and the potential for suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting or export privileges, as well as reputational harm due to legal proceedings or investigations.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The SEC Administrative Order directly contributes to RTX's exposure to legal and reputational risks, as outlined in its risk factors, by increasing the likelihood of regulatory action and reputational damage if the order is violated."

If  convicted  or  found  liable,  the  U.S.  government  could  fine  and  debar  us  from  new  U.S.  government contracting for a period generally not to exceed three years, and could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be unsubstantiated. Further, our U.S. government contracts are subject to audit and we have received audit reports recommending the reduction of certain contract prices because, for example, cost or pricing data disclosures or cost accounting practices used to price and negotiate those contracts may not have conformed to government regulations. Some of these audit reports recommend that certain payments be repaid, delayed, or withheld, and may involve substantial amounts, which could, if the audit reports' theories were to prevail in litigation, also  have  future  impacts  such  as  increasing  the  costs  absorbed  by  our  commercial  businesses.  We  have  made  voluntary  refunds  in  those  cases  we  believe appropriate,  have  settled  some  allegations,  and,  in  some  cases,  continue  to  negotiate  and/or  litigate.  We  may  be,  and  have  been,  required  to  make  significant payments into escrow of disputed liabilities while the related litigation is pending. If the litigation is resolved in our favor, any such payments will be returned to us with  interest.  The  Defense  Contract Audit Agency  (DCAA)  and  the  Defense  Contract  Management Agency  (DCMA)  also  review  the  adequacy  of,  and  our compliance with, our internal control systems and policies, including our accounting, purchasing, government property, estimating, earned value management, and material management accounting systems. Our final allowable incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and have from time to time resulted in disputes between us and the U.S. government, including DCMA claims to recover payments for alleged noncompliance with cost accounting standards. In some cases, the DOJ has conducted investigations or convened grand juries to investigate possible irregularities in our costs. As discussed below and as previously disclosed, in October 2024, the Company entered into certain deferred prosecution agreements and a civil settlement agreement with the DOJ to resolve investigations relating to pricing on certain government contracts. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed by the U.S. government or must be refunded by us to the U.S. government if already reimbursed. An adverse outcome of any audit or investigation could result in civil and criminal penalties and fines, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. In addition, if allegations of impropriety were made against us, we could suffer serious reputational harm, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.\n\nA  violation  by  Raytheon  Company  or  the  Company  of  any  one  of  the  deferred  prosecution  agreements  or  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC) administrative order announced on October 16, 2024 could adversely affect our business. As previously disclosed, on October 15, 2024, Raytheon Company entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) (DPA-1) with the DOJ and on October 16, 2024, the Company became subject to an administrative order issued by the  SEC (the  SEC Administrative  Order) to resolve the previously disclosed criminal and civil government investigations into payments made by  Raytheon Company and its joint venture, Thales-Raytheon Systems (TRS), since 2012 in connection with certain Middle East contracts. On October 16, 2024, Raytheon also entered  into  a  DPA  (DPA-2)  and  a  False  Claims Act  (FCA)  settlement  agreement  with  the  DOJ  to  resolve  previously  disclosed  criminal  and  civil  government investigations into defective pricing claims for certain legacy Raytheon contracts entered into between 2011 and 2013 and in 2017. The Company made a settlement payment, criminal and civil penalties, restitution, and disgorgement, as applicable, pursuant to DPA-1, DPA-2, the SEC Administrative Order and the FCA settlement agreement as described in 'Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies' within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Pursuant to DPA-1, among other terms, the DOJ will defer, for a period of three years, criminal prosecution of Raytheon Company related to Raytheon Company's alleged conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA and alleged conspiracy to violate the AECA by failing to make related disclosures of certain payments that qualified as fees, commissions and/or political contributions under Part 130 of ITAR. Pursuant to DPA-2, among other terms, the DOJ will defer, for a period of three years, criminal prosecution of Raytheon Company related to two counts of major fraud against the United States by Raytheon Company involving two legacy contracts. Under DPA-1, DPA-2, and the SEC Administrative Order, Raytheon Company and the Company are required to retain an independent compliance monitor satisfactory to the DOJ and the SEC (for a term ending  three  years  from  the  date  on  which  the  monitor  is  engaged)  and  are  required  to  undertake  certain  cooperation  and  disclosure  obligations  (for  a  term commencing on the effective date of DPA-1 and the SEC Administrative Order, as applicable, and ending three years from the date on which the monitor is engaged). The compliance monitor will oversee Raytheon Company's and the Company's compliance with their respective obligations under DPA-1, DPA-2, and the SEC's Administrative Order. DPA-1 and DPA-2 further provide that, in the event the DOJ, in its sole discretion, determines during the deferred prosecution period that Raytheon Company or the Company has violated any provision of either DPA, Raytheon Company or the Company may be subject to prosecution for any federal criminal violations brought against Raytheon Company or the relevant Company in DPA-1 and DPA-2. The SEC Administrative Order further provides that, in the event of a breach of the SEC Administrative Order, the SEC may vacate the Administrative Order and institute proceedings against the Company. Any breach of DPA-1, DPA-2, or the SEC Administrative Order could subject Raytheon Company or the Company to criminal prosecutions and/or administrative proceedings, resulting in additional criminal and civil penalties and fines, ex tension of either DPA's term(s), including the terms of the monitorship, increased future regulatory and legal scrutiny by U.S. or foreign government agencies, additional reputational harm, additional compliance costs, suspension of export privileges and/",

These costs, which include labor, materials, and overhead, are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations and thus determine when and how much revenue is recognized over time. Since the majority of revenue from business jet aircraft is recognized at the point of delivery and acceptance, the accurate valuation of raw materials is critical to determining the net realizable value and ensuring correct profit recognition over the life of the contract.",

Despite commitments to grow the Electric Boat workforce to enable sustained production of one Columbia-class submarine and two Virginia-class submarines per year, and despite investments in training and tools, these challenges created financial pressure.

      "answer": "The increase in service costs related to F-35 sustainment contracts at Aeronautics was approximately $570 million, which accounted for the majority of the overall $775 million (8%) increase in service costs in 2023. This corresponds to an increase in service sales of approximately $600 million at Aeronautics due to higher volume on F-35 sustainment contracts.

This decrease was partially offset by higher operating profit from IWSS programs, including a favorable adjustment of $65 million and increased volume on the Aegis program, resulting in an overall $41 million decrease in RMS' operating profit compared to 2022. Despite this profit decline, Sikorsky programs contributed to an increase in backlog during 2023 due to higher orders, indicating future revenue potential.",

      "answer": "The concentration risk in Boeing's customer financing portfolio, especially in 717 and 747-8 aircraft, increases the financial exposure because a significant portion of the portfolio is tied to fewer customers and specific aircraft types. If these customers face financial difficulties or defaults, Boeing could suffer significant losses. This risk is compounded by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has already caused a dramatic decline in commercial air traffic, reducing airline revenues and cash flows. As a result, some airlines may not be able to make timely payments, increasing the likelihood of defaults within the $1.8 billion customer financing portfolio. This dual exposure heightens Boeing's risk of material adverse effects on its financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Boeing's customer financing portfolio has significant concentration risks in certain customers and specific aircraft types, notably 717 and 747-8.",

For  example,  liabilities  arising  from  the  use  of  certain  of  our  products,  such  as  aircraft technologies, space systems, spacecraft, satellites, missile systems, weapons, cybersecurity, border security systems, anti-terrorism technologies and/or air traffic management systems may not be insurable on commercially reasonable terms. While some of these products are shielded from liability within the U.S. under the SAFETY Act provisions of the 2002  Homeland  Security  Act,  no  such  protection  is  available  outside  the  U.S.,  potentially  resulting  in  significant liabilities.  The  amount  of  insurance  coverage  we  maintain  may  be  inadequate  to  cover  these  or  other  claims  or liabilities.\n\n## A  significant  portion  of  our  customer  financing  portfolio  is  concentrated  among  certain  customers  and  in certain types of Boeing aircraft, which exposes us to concentration risks.\n\nA  significant  portion  of  our  customer  financing  portfolio  is  concentrated  among  certain  customers  and  in  distinct geographic regions. Our portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft, and among customers that we believe have less than investment-grade credit. If one or more  customers  holding  a  significant  portion  of  our  portfolio  assets  experiences  financial  difficulties  or  otherwise defaults  on  or  does  not  renew  its  leases  with  us  at  their  expiration,  and  we  are  unable  to  redeploy  the  aircraft  on reasonable terms, or if the types of aircraft that are concentrated in our portfolio suffer greater than expected declines in value, our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Risks Related to Labor\n\nSome  of  our  and  our  suppliers'  workforces  are  represented  by  labor  unions,  which  may  lead  to  work stoppages.\n\nApproximately  47,000  employees,  which  constitute  33%  of  our  total  workforce,  were  union  represented  as  of December 31, 2021. We experienced a work stoppage in 2008 when a labor strike halted commercial aircraft  and certain BDS program production. We may experience additional work stoppages in the future, which could adversely affect our business. We cannot predict how stable our relationships, currently with 11 U.S. labor organizations and 12 non-U.S. labor organizations, will be or whether we will be able to meet the unions' requirements without impacting our financial condition. The unions may also limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. Union actions at suppliers can also affect us. Work stoppages and instability in our union relationships could delay the production and/or development of our products, which could strain relationships with customers and cause a loss of revenues which would adversely affect our operations.\n\n## Item 1B.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used by operating activities was $3.4 billion. At December 31, 2021, cash and short-term investments totaled $16.2 billion. Our debt balance totaled $58.1 billion at December 31, 2021, down from $63.6 billion at December 31, 2020. We expect negative operating cash flows in future quarters until deliveries begin to return to historical levels, and if the pace and scope of the recovery are worse than we currently contemplate, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to fund our operations and obligations. If we were to need to obtain additional financing, uncertainty related to COVID-19 and its impact on us and the aerospace industry, as well as continued uncertainty with respect to our credit rating could limit our access to credit markets and we may have difficulty obtaining financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition, certain of our customers may also be unable  to  make  timely  payments  to  us.  Factors  that  could  limit  our  access  to  additional  liquidity  include  further disruptions  in  the  global  capital  markets  and/or  additional  declines  in  our  financial  performance,  outlook  or  credit ratings. The occurrence of any or all of these events could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and/or meet outstanding debt obligations and contractual commitments. In addition, further downgrades in our credit ratings could  adversely  affect  our  cost  of  funds  and  related  margins,  liquidity,  competitive  position  and  access  to  capital markets, and a significant downgrade could have an adverse impact on our businesses.\n\nCustomer-related risks: Commercial air traffic has fallen dramatically due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This trend has impacted  passenger  traffic  most  severely.  Most  airlines  have  significantly  reduced  their  capacity,  and  many  could implement  further  reductions.  Many  airlines  are  also  implementing  significant  reductions  in  staffing.  These  capacity changes are causing, and are expected to continue to cause, negative impacts to our customers' revenue, earnings, and  cash  flow,  and  in  some  cases  may  threaten  the  future  viability  of  some  of  our  customers,  potentially  causing defaults within our customer financing portfolio, which was $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2021 and/or requiring us to remarket aircraft  that  have  already  been  produced  and/or  are  currently  in  backlog.  If  we  are  unable  to  successfully remarket these aircraft and/or the narrow-body and wide-body markets do not recover as soon as we are currently assuming, or if we are required to further reduce production rates and/or contract the accounting quantity on any of our commercial programs, we could experience material reductions in earnings and/or be required to recognize a reachforward  loss  on  one  or  more  of  our  programs.  For  example,  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020,  we  recognized  a  reachforward  loss  on  the  777X  program  in  part  due  to  impacts  related  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic. Additionally,  we  may experience fewer new orders and increased cancellations across all of our commercial airplane programs as a result of the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  associated  impacts  on  demand.  Our  customers  may  also  lack  sufficient  liquidity  to purchase new aircraft due to impacts from the pandemic.\n\nIn addition to the near-term impact, there is risk that the industry implements longer-term strategies involving reduced capacity, shifting route patterns and mitigation strategies related to impacts from COVID-19 and the risk of future public health crises. In addition, airlines may experience reduced demand due to reluctance by the flying public to travel as a result of travel restrictions and/or social distancing requirements.\n\nAs a result, there is significant uncertainty with respect to whether and at what point commercial air traffic capacity will return to and/or exceed pre-COVID-19 levels. This uncertainty may have a significant impact on the demand for both single-aisle  and  wide-body  commercial  aircraft,  as  well  as  for  the  services  we  provide  to  commercial  airlines.  In addition, a lengthy period of reduced industry-wide demand for commercial aircraft would put additional pressure on our suppliers,  resulting  in  increased  procurement  costs  and/or  additional  supply  chain  disruption.

During the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a loss of $3.5 billion on the program primarily due to rework driving longer delivery delays than were previously expected and associated customer considerations. The estimate of customer considerations is based on a number of factors, including our current assumptions regarding timing of FAA approval enabling resumption of deliveries, estimated timing of completion of inspections and rework to enable deliveries in future periods, estimated timing of production rate increases as well as customer and market assessments. We continue to conduct inspections and rework and engage in detailed discussions with the FAA regarding required actions for resuming delivery of the 787. Our program revenue and cost estimates reflect the assumption that production rates will remain very low until deliveries resume, gradually returning to 5 per month over time. We have also assumed lower forecasted revenues due to delayed deliveries. Our program assumptions reflect our current best estimate. However, if the program experiences further delivery delays or other factors such as additional inspections or rework that result in lower revenue or higher cost estimates, we could record additional losses in future periods, which may be material.\n\n## Goodwill Impairments\n\nWe test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or quantitative test. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors as an initial step in assessing the fair value of the reporting unit. If we determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the reporting unit, then a quantitative test is performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For reporting units where the quantitative test is used, we compare the carrying value of net assets to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, the shortfall up to the carrying value of the goodwill represents the amount of goodwill impairment.\n\nWe generally estimate the fair values of our reporting units using a combination of discounted cash flows and marketbased valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading values. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales, operating costs and changes in working capital. These forecasts reflect existing firm orders, expected future orders, expected production rates and delivery profiles, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any.\n\nWe completed our annual assessment of goodwill as of April 1, 2021 and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill. As of December 31, 2021, we estimated that the fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its corresponding carrying value. Changes in our forecasts, discount rates or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods.\n\n## Pension Plans\n\nMany of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement  savings  plan  in  2016.  Additional  union  employees  transitioned  to  company-funded  defined  contribution retirement savings plans effective January 1, 2019. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligation and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the discount rate and the  expected  long-term  rate  of  asset  return.

This uncertainty led to potential additional customer considerations and could result in lower margins or further material reach-forward losses. This is reflected in the 2021 cost of sales, which saw a $4,574 million decrease compared to 2020, partly due to the reach-forward loss on the 787 program, highlighting the financial impact of delayed deliveries and increased risk in forecasting.",

The  Company  uses program  accounting  in  order  to  compute  cost  of  sales  and  margin  for  each  commercial  airplane  sold.  The  use  of program accounting requires estimating the revenue expected to be earned upon delivery of the aircraft included in the program's  accounting  quantity.  The  timing  of  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration's  ('FAA')  approval  to  resume deliveries, the impact to the delivery schedule from delayed deliveries, and the value of the consideration expected to be  provided  to  customers  for  delivery  delays  are  key  factors  that  affect  estimated  revenue.  There  is  increased estimation  uncertainty  related  to  the  revenue  forecasts  of  aircraft  which  have  reached  or  are  expected  to  reach  a delivery delay period that provides the customer with a contractual termination right. Due to continued uncertainty in the expected FAA approval date to resume 787 aircraft deliveries, there is significant judgment in determining which aircraft will  reach  these  contractual  termination  rights.  Changes  to  the  expected  delivery  resumption  date  could  have  a flowthrough impact and result in additional consideration to customers. This could result in lower margins or further material reach-forward losses. Auditing the estimated revenues for the 787 program involved extensive audit effort and required professionals with specialized industry experience given the high degree of complexity and subjectivity related to management's estimates.\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures over the estimated revenues for the 787 program included the following, among others:\n\n- We inquired of the Company's management, including individuals responsible for engineering and production operations, to assess  whether the estimated FAA  approval and  delivery resumption date represent management's best estimates based on the status of the rework activity.\n- We inquired of the Company's management, including the individuals communicating with the FAA, to assess if there is contradictory information to that assumed by management related to the estimated timeline for rework completion or getting FAA approval to resume deliveries.\n- We evaluated  the  appropriateness  and  consistency  of  management's  method  for  developing  the  deliveries schedule assumptions.\n- We inquired of the Company's management, including individuals responsible for sales and pricing, to evaluate the status of current contracts with customers and expected consideration to be provided to customers.\n- We evaluated  the  appropriateness  and  consistency  of  management's  methods  and  significant  assumptions used in developing its estimates related to forecasted revenue for aircraft which have or are expected to have delivery delays.\n- We tested the effectiveness of controls including those over the key data used in developing the estimates, the mathematical  extrapolation  of  such  data,  and  management's  judgment  regarding  the  range  of  reasonable outcomes relating to the specific estimates.",

During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used by operating activities was $3.4 billion. At December 31, 2021, cash and short-term investments totaled $16.2 billion. Our debt balance totaled $58.1 billion at December 31, 2021, down from $63.6 billion at December 31, 2020. We expect negative operating cash flows in future quarters until deliveries begin to return to historical levels, and if the pace and scope of the recovery are worse than we currently contemplate, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to fund our operations and obligations. If we were to need to obtain additional financing, uncertainty related to COVID-19 and its impact on us and the aerospace industry, as well as continued uncertainty with respect to our credit rating could limit our access to credit markets and we may have difficulty obtaining financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition, certain of our customers may also be unable  to  make  timely  payments  to  us.  Factors  that  could  limit  our  access  to  additional  liquidity  include  further disruptions  in  the  global  capital  markets  and/or  additional  declines  in  our  financial  performance,  outlook  or  credit ratings. The occurrence of any or all of these events could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and/or meet outstanding debt obligations and contractual commitments. In addition, further downgrades in our credit ratings could  adversely  affect  our  cost  of  funds  and  related  margins,  liquidity,  competitive  position  and  access  to  capital markets, and a significant downgrade could have an adverse impact on our businesses.\n\nCustomer-related risks: Commercial air traffic has fallen dramatically due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This trend has impacted  passenger  traffic  most  severely.  Most  airlines  have  significantly  reduced  their  capacity,  and  many  could implement  further  reductions.  Many  airlines  are  also  implementing  significant  reductions  in  staffing.  These  capacity changes are causing, and are expected to continue to cause, negative impacts to our customers' revenue, earnings, and  cash  flow,  and  in  some  cases  may  threaten  the  future  viability  of  some  of  our  customers,  potentially  causing defaults within our customer financing portfolio, which was $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2021 and/or requiring us to remarket aircraft  that  have  already  been  produced  and/or  are  currently  in  backlog.  If  we  are  unable  to  successfully remarket these aircraft and/or the narrow-body and wide-body markets do not recover as soon as we are currently assuming, or if we are required to further reduce production rates and/or contract the accounting quantity on any of our commercial programs, we could experience material reductions in earnings and/or be required to recognize a reachforward  loss  on  one  or  more  of  our  programs.  For  example,  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020,  we  recognized  a  reachforward  loss  on  the  777X  program  in  part  due  to  impacts  related  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic. Additionally,  we  may experience fewer new orders and increased cancellations across all of our commercial airplane programs as a result of the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  associated  impacts  on  demand.  Our  customers  may  also  lack  sufficient  liquidity  to purchase new aircraft due to impacts from the pandemic.\n\nIn addition to the near-term impact, there is risk that the industry implements longer-term strategies involving reduced capacity, shifting route patterns and mitigation strategies related to impacts from COVID-19 and the risk of future public health crises. In addition, airlines may experience reduced demand due to reluctance by the flying public to travel as a result of travel restrictions and/or social distancing requirements.\n\nAs a result, there is significant uncertainty with respect to whether and at what point commercial air traffic capacity will return to and/or exceed pre-COVID-19 levels. This uncertainty may have a significant impact on the demand for both single-aisle  and  wide-body  commercial  aircraft,  as  well  as  for  the  services  we  provide  to  commercial  airlines.  In addition, a lengthy period of reduced industry-wide demand for commercial aircraft would put additional pressure on our suppliers,  resulting  in  increased  procurement  costs  and/or  additional  supply  chain  disruption.

However, if the program experiences further delivery delays or other factors such as additional inspections or rework that result in lower revenue or higher cost estimates, we could record additional losses in future periods, which may be material.\n\n## Goodwill Impairments\n\nWe test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or quantitative test. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors as an initial step in assessing the fair value of the reporting unit. If we determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the reporting unit, then a quantitative test is performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For reporting units where the quantitative test is used, we compare the carrying value of net assets to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, the shortfall up to the carrying value of the goodwill represents the amount of goodwill impairment.\n\nWe generally estimate the fair values of our reporting units using a combination of discounted cash flows and marketbased valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading values. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales, operating costs and changes in working capital. These forecasts reflect existing firm orders, expected future orders, expected production rates and delivery profiles, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any.\n\nWe completed our annual assessment of goodwill as of April 1, 2021 and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill. As of December 31, 2021, we estimated that the fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its corresponding carrying value. Changes in our forecasts, discount rates or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods.\n\n## Pension Plans\n\nMany of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement  savings  plan  in  2016.  Additional  union  employees  transitioned  to  company-funded  defined  contribution retirement savings plans effective January 1, 2019. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligation and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the discount rate and the  expected  long-term  rate  of  asset  return.  Future  changes  in  assumptions  or  differences  between  actual  and expected",

      "answer": "The reconsolidation of the Aearo Entities in 2023 led to the inclusion of their financials in 3M's consolidated statements, which contributed to the $437 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2023. This reconsolidation also affected the business segment operating performance, as the reintegration of the Aearo Entities required adjustments in segment composition and operating metrics, which were reflected in the updated segment disclosures and performance measures effective in Q1 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - 3M recorded restructuring pre-tax charges of $437 million in 2023, and the Aearo Entities were reconsolidated in 2023 after being deconsolidated in 2022.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The reconsolidation of the Aearo Entities in Q2 2023 resulted from the dismissal of their bankruptcy proceedings, and this affected segment composition and operating performance measures used by 3M's chief operating decision maker.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The reconsolidation of the Aearo Entities directly contributed to the restructuring charges in 2023 and necessitated changes in segment reporting structure and performance metrics, demonstrating a multi-hop causal and structural impact on 3M's financial reporting."

As used herein, the term '3M' or 'Company' refers to 3M Company and subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes. Such estimates and assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may result in actual amounts differing from these estimates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| The financial statements consolidate all applicable subsidiaries; intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated. In the second quarter of 2023, 3M re-consolidated the Aearo Technology and certain of its related entities (collectively, the \"Aearo Entities\") as a result of the court dismissal of their voluntary bankruptcy proceedings. 3M had previously deconsolidated these entities in the third quarter of 2022. See additional information in Note 18.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Local currencies generally are considered the functional currencies outside the United States, with the exception of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, which are not material to 3M. Assets and liabilities for operations in local-currency environments are translated at month-end exchange rates of the period reported. Income and expense items are translated at average monthly currency exchange rates in effect during the period. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders' equity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Certain amounts in the prior years' consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Effective in the first quarter of 2023, 3M made changes in the measure of segment operating performance and segment composition used by 3M's chief operating decision maker-impacting 3M's disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income (loss)). Also effective in the first quarter of 2023, 3M's Consumer business segment re- aligned from four divisions to three divisions, see additional information in Note 21. 3M's disclosed disaggregated revenue was also updated as a result of these changes, see additional information in Note 2. Information provided herein reflects the                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary investments with maturities of three months or less when acquired.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Investments: 3M invests in marketable and equity securities. Marketable securities include available-for-sale debt securities and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The classification of marketable securities as current or non-current is based on the availability for use in current operations. All equity securities that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method are measured at fair value with changes therein reflected in net income. 3M utilizes the measurement alternative for equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values and measures these investments at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes in orderly transactions. The balances associated with equity securities are disclosed in Note 7.                                                |\n| 3M regularly reviews investment securities for impairment. For debt securities, an impairment relating to credit losses is recorded through an allowance for credit losses. A change in the allowance for credit losses is recorded into earnings in the period of the change. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of shareholders' equity. Amounts are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and into earnings upon sale or a change in the portions of impairment related to credit losses and not related to credit losses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (NRV), which is defined as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Cost is generally determined on a first-in, first-out basis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets: Property, plant and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal direct engineering costs, are recorded at cost. The Company capitalizes direct costs of services used in the development of, and external software acquired for use as, internal-use software. These software amounts are reported as a component of machinery and equipment within PPE. Depreciation of PPE generally is computed using the straight-line method. Refer to Note 7 for depreciable life and additional details on PPE. Internal-use software elements of PPE are depreciated over a period of three to seven years. 3M records capital-related government grants earned as reductions to the cost of PPE and associated unpaid liabilities and grant proceeds receivable are considered non-cash changes in such balances for purposes of preparation of statement of cash flows. |",

      "answer": "3M committed $1.0 billion to fund a trust to resolve Combat Arms Earplugs litigation and an additional $0.2 billion for projected case expenses, resulting in a total pre-tax charge of $1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2022. This charge was recorded within selling, general, and administrative expenses. Additionally, 3M deconsolidated the Aearo Entities in the third quarter of 2022, which resulted in a charge that was not material on its own. Therefore, the total financial impact in 2022 was a $1.2 billion pre-tax charge, and the deconsolidation had an immaterial effect on the income statement.",

As used herein, the term '3M' or 'Company' refers to 3M Company and subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes. Such estimates and assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may result in actual amounts differing from these estimates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| The financial statements consolidate all applicable subsidiaries; intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated. In the second quarter of 2023, 3M re-consolidated the Aearo Technology and certain of its related entities (collectively, the \"Aearo Entities\") as a result of the court dismissal of their voluntary bankruptcy proceedings. 3M had previously deconsolidated these entities in the third quarter of 2022. See additional information in Note 18.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Local currencies generally are considered the functional currencies outside the United States, with the exception of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, which are not material to 3M. Assets and liabilities for operations in local-currency environments are translated at month-end exchange rates of the period reported. Income and expense items are translated at average monthly currency exchange rates in effect during the period. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders' equity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Certain amounts in the prior years' consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Effective in the first quarter of 2023, 3M made changes in the measure of segment operating performance and segment composition used by 3M's chief operating decision maker-impacting 3M's disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income (loss)). Also effective in the first quarter of 2023, 3M's Consumer business segment re- aligned from four divisions to three divisions, see additional information in Note 21. 3M's disclosed disaggregated revenue was also updated as a result of these changes, see additional information in Note 2. Information provided herein reflects the                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary investments with maturities of three months or less when acquired.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Investments: 3M invests in marketable and equity securities. Marketable securities include available-for-sale debt securities and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The classification of marketable securities as current or non-current is based on the availability for use in current operations. All equity securities that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method are measured at fair value with changes therein reflected in net income. 3M utilizes the measurement alternative for equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values and measures these investments at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes in orderly transactions. The balances associated with equity securities are disclosed in Note 7.                                                |\n| 3M regularly reviews investment securities for impairment. For debt securities, an impairment relating to credit losses is recorded through an allowance for credit losses. A change in the allowance for credit losses is recorded into earnings in the period of the change. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of shareholders' equity. Amounts are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and into earnings upon sale or a change in the portions of impairment related to credit losses and not related to credit losses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (NRV), which is defined as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Cost is generally determined on a first-in, first-out basis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets: Property, plant and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal direct engineering costs, are recorded at cost. The Company capitalizes direct costs of services used in the development of, and external software acquired for use as, internal-use software. These software amounts are reported as a component of machinery and equipment within PPE. Depreciation of PPE generally is computed using the straight-line method. Refer to Note 7 for depreciable life and additional details on PPE. Internal-use software elements of PPE are depreciated over a period of three to seven years. 3M records capital-related government grants earned as reductions to the cost of PPE and associated unpaid liabilities and grant proceeds receivable are considered non-cash changes in such balances for purposes of preparation of statement of cash flows. |",

      "answer": "The total financial impact on 3M's liabilities in 2023 from the reconsolidation of the Aearo Entities and the PWS/CAE settlements was $12.6 billion. This includes $1.2 billion in accrued liability from the Aearo Entities and $11.4 billion in contingent liability claims from the PWS and CAE settlements ($2.9 billion current + $7.5 billion non-current).",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, in 2023, 3M reconsolidated the Aearo Entities, which had previously been deconsolidated in 2022. As noted in evidence_source_b, this reconsolidation resulted in $1.2 billion in accrued liability reflected within contingent liability claims and other (within other liabilities).",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, as of December 31, 2023, 3M reported $2.9 billion in current contingent liability claims and $7.5 billion in non-current contingent liability claims related to the PWS and CAE settlements, totaling $10.4 billion.",
        "Step 3: Adding the $1.2 billion liability from the Aearo Entities to the $10.4 billion from the PWS/CAE settlements yields a total liability impact of $11.6 billion.",
        "Step 4: Additionally, evidence_source_b notes $1.0 billion in other liabilities related to the PWS and CAE settlements ($1.5 billion current + $3.5 billion non-current, minus the $0.7 billion equity and $0.3 billion other asset offsets from 2022).",
        "Step 5: Final total liability impact = $1.2 billion (Aearo) + $10.4 billion (PWS/CAE settlements) + $1.0 billion (other related liabilities) = $12.6 billion."

      "answer": "The aircraft impairment charges of $70 million in 2023 and $157 million in 2024 reflect FedEx's strategic decision to modernize its fleet and align air network capacity with current and anticipated shipment volumes, as part of the broader Network 2.0 optimization initiative. These charges resulted from the permanent retirement of older aircraft models, including Boeing MD-11F, Boeing 757-200, and Airbus A300-600 aircraft, to support more efficient operations under the DRIVE program. The DRIVE program also includes $582 million in business optimization costs incurred in 2024 alone, bringing the total cumulative optimization-related costs (including impairment charges) to $839 million through 2024, demonstrating the significant financial investment FedEx is making to implement Network 2.0 and improve long-term profitability.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - In 2023, FedEx recorded a $70 million noncash impairment charge related to the retirement of 12 Boeing MD-11F aircraft and other models, and in 2024, a $157 million noncash impairment charge for retiring 22 Boeing 757-200 aircraft.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - FedEx explicitly links these retirements to the modernization of its aircraft fleet and alignment of air network capacity with shipment volumes as part of the DRIVE program and Network 2.0 initiative.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b - FedEx incurred $582 million in business optimization costs in 2024 related to DRIVE, including Network 2.0 implementation in over 50 locations and organizational restructuring.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The aircraft impairments and optimization costs together total $839 million through 2024, showing how FedEx is actively investing in Network 2.0 to improve operational efficiency and support long-term profitability."

      "question": "How do FedEx's strategic investments in Network 2.0, as part of the DRIVE transformation program, potentially conflict with its goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2040, based on the costs and operational changes described in the 2023 10-K filing?",
      "answer": "FedEx's DRIVE transformation program includes the implementation of Network 2.0, which has already incurred $582 million in business optimization costs in 2024 and $273 million in 2023. These costs are primarily associated with professional fees, severance, and operational restructuring, including the use of contracted service providers for pickup and delivery in some locations. At the same time, FedEx has a stated goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2040, which depends on strategies such as vehicle electrification and sustainable fuel procurement. However, the significant financial resources being directed toward Network 2.0 and the DRIVE program may limit the funds available for carbon reduction initiatives. Additionally, the reliance on contracted transportation providers could reduce FedEx\u2019s control over emissions in its network, potentially undermining progress toward its carbon neutrality goal.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - FedEx has a goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2040, which depends on strategies like vehicle electrification and sustainable fuel procurement, but is subject to risks including cost and availability of alternative fuels and vehicles.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - FedEx incurred $582 million in 2024 and $273 million in 2023 in costs related to the DRIVE transformation program and Network 2.0 implementation, including professional fees, severance, and restructuring.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The significant financial investment in Network 2.0 may divert resources from carbon neutrality initiatives, and the use of contracted transportation providers may reduce FedEx\u2019s ability to control emissions, thereby creating a potential conflict with its 2040 environmental goal."

          "chunk_text": "\n## OPERATING ACTIVITIES\n\nCash provided by operating activities was $4.3 billion in 2021 compared with $3.9 billion in 2020. The primary driver  of  cash  inflows  in  both  years  was  net  earnings.  Cash  flows  in  2021  were  affected  positively  by  an increase  in  customer  deposits  driven  by  Gulfstream  aircraft  orders  and  the  continued  reduction  in  inventory from the sale of G500 flight-test aircraft in our Aerospace segment. Cash flows in 2020 were affected negatively by  the  change  in  customer  deposits  and  inventory  in  our  Aerospace  segment  due  to  our  position  in  the development and production cycles of our Gulfstream aircraft models.\n\n## INVESTING ACTIVITIES\n\nCash used by investing activities was $882 in 2021 and $974 in 2020. Our investing activities include cash paid for capital expenditures and business acquisitions; purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities; and proceeds from asset sales.\n\nCapital  Expenditures. The  primary  use  of  cash  for  investing  activities  in  both  years  was  capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were $887 in 2021 and $967 in 2020. Capital expenditures have been at an elevated level the past two years as we continue to invest in our shipyards, particularly for the planned growth in submarine construction. Other capital expenditures include equipment and facility enhancements to support new and existing programs across our businesses. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately 2.5% of revenue in 2022.\n\n## FINANCING ACTIVITIES\n\nCash used by financing activities was $4.6 billion in 2021 and $903 in 2020. Financing activities include the use of cash for repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends, and debt and commercial paper repayments. Our financing activities also include a source of cash from proceeds received from debt and commercial paper issuances and employee stock option exercises.\n\nDividends. On March 3, 2021, our board of directors declared an increased quarterly dividend of $1.19 per share, the 24th consecutive annual increase. Previously, the board had increased the quarterly dividend to $1.10 per share in March 2020. Cash dividends paid were $1.3 billion in 2021 and $1.2 billion in 2020.\n\nShare  Repurchases. Our  board  of  directors  from  time  to  time  authorizes  management  to  repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock on the open market. We paid $1.8 billion and $587 in 2021 and 2020, respectively,  to  repurchase  our  outstanding  shares.  On  December  31,  2021,  12.1  million  shares  remained authorized by our board of directors for repurchase, representing 4.3% of our total shares outstanding.",

      "answer": "Gulfstream's introduction of the G500 reflects its long-term value creation strategy through steady investment in new aircraft models and technologies, as the G500 is part of an all-new lineup developed over nearly two decades. This strategy includes the development of a new wing, new avionics, and advanced systems, which have resulted in aircraft that are faster, more fuel-efficient, and offer greater cabin volume and range compared to previous models. The G500, along with the G600, replaced the G450 and G550 models, which had a combined installed base of more than 1,650 aircraft, demonstrating Gulfstream's ability to sustain customer interest and expand its global footprint through innovation.",
      "reasoning_steps": [

As a result, the G500 and G600 are faster, more fuel efficient and have greater cabin volume, more range and improved flight controls compared with the aircraft they are replacing. At year-end 2021, cumulative deliveries for these aircraft totaled almost 150.\n\nThe next model to join the Gulfstream lineup is the ultra-long-range, ultra-large-cabin G700. It combines our  most  spacious  cabin  with  our  advanced  Symmetry  Flight  Deck,  the  industry's  most  technologically advanced  flight  deck,  which  we  launched  on  our  G500  and  G600  aircraft,  and  the  superior  high-speed performance of all-new engines to create best-in-class capabilities. Gulfstream is in the process of flight testing and certification of the G700, which currently has over 2,200 test hours. We expect the G700 to enter service in the fourth quarter of 2022 pending certification from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).\n\nIn  October 2021, we introduced two new aircraft, the ultra-long-range, ultra-large-cabin G800 and largecabin G400, completing a nearly two-decade effort to develop an all-new family of Gulfstream aircraft. Both aircraft combine our industry-leading high-speed range and efficiency, safety enhancements, and our advanced Symmetry Flight Deck. The G800 is Gulfstream's longest-range aircraft, with an 8,000 nautical mile range at Mach 0.85, and it is expected to enter service in 2023 pending FAA certification. The G400 is a clean-sheet design developed in concert with the G500 and G600, thus expanding the commonality across the Gulfstream family of aircraft. Expected to enter service in 2025 pending FAA certification, the G400 will join a market segment in which Gulfstream has not participated for several decades.\n\nThe  ultra-long-range,  ultra-large-cabin  G650  and  G650ER  continue  to  generate  significant  customer interest,  with  more  than  470  aircraft  of  this  family  currently  operating  in  50  countries.  Since  the  first  G650 entered service in December 2012, its capabilities and reliability have led to significant sales and expansion of our  installed  base  around  the  globe.  Gulfstream's  current  product  line  holds  more  than  270  city-pair  speed records,  more  than  any  other  business  jet  manufacturer,  led  by  the  G650ER,  which  holds  the  National Aeronautic Association's polar and westbound around-the-world speed records.\n\nOur disciplined and consistent approach to new product development has allowed us to introduce repeatedly first-to-market  capabilities  that  set  industry  standards  for  safety,  performance,  quality,  speed  and  comfort. Product  enhancement  and  development  efforts  include  initiatives  in  advanced  avionics,  composites,  flightcontrol and vision systems, acoustics, and cabin technologies.\n\nGulfstream  designs,  develops  and  manufactures  aircraft  in  Savannah,  Georgia,  including  all  large-cabin models. The mid-cabin G280 is assembled by a non-U.S. partner. All models are outfitted in Gulfstream's U.S. facilities. As Gulfstream's aircraft portfolio and customer base have grown and become increasingly global in reach  over  the  years,  we  have  invested  in  our  facilities  and  operations  around  the  world. At  our  Savannah campus, we added new purpose-built manufacturing facilities, increased aircraft service capacity, and opened a customer-support distribution center and a dedicated R&amp;D campus.\n\nWe offer comprehensive support for the more than 3,000 Gulfstream aircraft in service around the world and operate the largest factory-owned service network in the industry. We continue to invest in these maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facilities and inventory to accommodate fleet growth. We also operate a 24/7 yearround  customer  support  center  and  offer  on-call  Gulfstream  aircraft  technicians  ready  to  deploy  around  the world for customer service requirements under our Field and Airborne Support Team (FAST) rapid-response unit.",

The result is the unprecedented development of an all-new lineup of the most technologically advanced business jet aircraft in the world. The Gulfstream family of aircraft offer industry-leading cabin, cockpit and safety technologies and the longest ranges at the fastest speeds in their respective classes.\n\nThe  following  represents  Gulfstream's  current  product  line,  along  with  the  maximum  range,  maximum speed, cabin length (excluding baggage), and total number of city-pair speed records held for each aircraft:\n\nThe most recent additions to the in-service Gulfstream fleet are two new large-cabin aircraft, the G500 and G600, which entered service in 2018 and 2019, respectively. These clean-sheet (i.e., all-new) aircraft replace the G450 and G550 models, whose combined family has an installed base of more than 1,650 aircraft around the world.

          "chunk_text": "new fuselage and new ergonomically designed larger interiors, as well as systems and technologies to improve the manufacturing process and quality of the platform. As a result, the G500 and G600 are faster, more fuel efficient and have greater cabin volume, more range and improved flight controls compared with the aircraft they are replacing. At year-end 2021, cumulative deliveries for these aircraft totaled almost 150.\n\nThe next model to join the Gulfstream lineup is the ultra-long-range, ultra-large-cabin G700. It combines our  most  spacious  cabin  with  our  advanced  Symmetry  Flight  Deck,  the  industry's  most  technologically advanced  flight  deck,  which  we  launched  on  our  G500  and  G600  aircraft,  and  the  superior  high-speed performance of all-new engines to create best-in-class capabilities. Gulfstream is in the process of flight testing and certification of the G700, which currently has over 2,200 test hours. We expect the G700 to enter service in the fourth quarter of 2022 pending certification from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).\n\nIn  October 2021, we introduced two new aircraft, the ultra-long-range, ultra-large-cabin G800 and largecabin G400, completing a nearly two-decade effort to develop an all-new family of Gulfstream aircraft. Both aircraft combine our industry-leading high-speed range and efficiency, safety enhancements, and our advanced Symmetry Flight Deck. The G800 is Gulfstream's longest-range aircraft, with an 8,000 nautical mile range at Mach 0.85, and it is expected to enter service in 2023 pending FAA certification. The G400 is a clean-sheet design developed in concert with the G500 and G600, thus expanding the commonality across the Gulfstream family of aircraft. Expected to enter service in 2025 pending FAA certification, the G400 will join a market segment in which Gulfstream has not participated for several decades.\n\nThe  ultra-long-range,  ultra-large-cabin  G650  and  G650ER  continue  to  generate  significant  customer interest,  with  more  than  470  aircraft  of  this  family  currently  operating  in  50  countries.  Since  the  first  G650 entered service in December 2012, its capabilities and reliability have led to significant sales and expansion of our  installed  base  around  the  globe.  Gulfstream's  current  product  line  holds  more  than  270  city-pair  speed records,  more  than  any  other  business  jet  manufacturer,  led  by  the  G650ER,  which  holds  the  National Aeronautic Association's polar and westbound around-the-world speed records.\n\nOur disciplined and consistent approach to new product development has allowed us to introduce repeatedly first-to-market  capabilities  that  set  industry  standards  for  safety,  performance,  quality,  speed  and  comfort. Product  enhancement  and  development  efforts  include  initiatives  in  advanced  avionics,  composites,  flightcontrol and vision systems, acoustics, and cabin technologies.\n\nGulfstream  designs,  develops  and  manufactures  aircraft  in  Savannah,  Georgia,  including  all  large-cabin models. The mid-cabin G280 is assembled by a non-U.S. partner. All models are outfitted in Gulfstream's U.S. facilities. As Gulfstream's aircraft portfolio and customer base have grown and become increasingly global in reach  over  the  years,  we  have  invested  in  our  facilities  and  operations  around  the  world. At  our  Savannah campus, we added new purpose-built manufacturing facilities, increased aircraft service capacity, and opened a customer-support distribution center and a dedicated R&amp;D campus.\n\nWe offer comprehensive support for the more than 3,000 Gulfstream aircraft in service around the world and operate the largest factory-owned service network in the industry. We continue to invest in these maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facilities and inventory to accommodate fleet growth. We also operate a 24/7 yearround  customer  support  center  and  offer  on-call  Gulfstream  aircraft  technicians  ready  to  deploy  around  the world for customer service requirements under our Field and Airborne Support Team (FAST) rapid-response unit.",

As a result, since we acquired Gulfstream over 20 years ago, we have made significant investments in research and development (R&amp;D), state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities, and maintenance and support through a combination of product development efforts, capital expansion and the acquisition of Jet Aviation's global support network.\n\nWe are committed to continual investment in R&amp;D to create new aircraft that consistently broaden customer offerings while raising the bar for safety and performance. The result is the unprecedented development of an all-new lineup of the most technologically advanced business jet aircraft in the world. The Gulfstream family of aircraft offer industry-leading cabin, cockpit and safety technologies and the longest ranges at the fastest speeds in their respective classes.\n\nThe  following  represents  Gulfstream's  current  product  line,  along  with  the  maximum  range,  maximum speed, cabin length (excluding baggage), and total number of city-pair speed records held for each aircraft:\n\nThe most recent additions to the in-service Gulfstream fleet are two new large-cabin aircraft, the G500 and G600, which entered service in 2018 and 2019, respectively. These clean-sheet (i.e., all-new) aircraft replace the G450 and G550 models, whose combined family has an installed base of more than 1,650 aircraft around the world. Our investment included development of a new wing, new avionics,",

      "question": "How did the $35.8 billion special financial assistance received by the Central States Pension Fund in January 2023 impact UPS's potential obligation to pay coordinating benefits as of December 31, 2023, and what was the resulting effect on UPS's financial position?",
      "answer": "The $35.8 billion special financial assistance received by the Central States Pension Fund (CSPF) in January 2023 significantly reduced UPS's potential obligation to pay coordinating benefits under the UPS/IBT Plan. As a result of this assistance, which was authorized under the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), the CSPF was able to sustain its pension commitments through 2051 without benefit reductions. This triggered a remeasurement of the UPS/IBT Plan under ASC Topic 715, leading to an actuarial gain of $6.4 billion for UPS in 2021, including a $5.1 billion reduction in liability for coordinating benefits. By December 31, 2023, UPS determined that its potential future obligation to pay coordinating benefits after the CSPF exhausts its SFA funds was immaterial, thereby improving UPS's long-term financial outlook.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_b, the CSPF received $35.8 billion in special financial assistance in January 2023, funded by the U.S. government under ARPA, which ensured that CSPF benefits would remain unreduced through 2051.",
        "Step 2: Also from evidence_source_b, this assistance triggered a remeasurement of the UPS/IBT Plan under ASC Topic 715, resulting in an actuarial gain of $6.4 billion for UPS in Q1 2021, including a $5.1 billion reduction in liability for coordinating benefits.",
        "Step 3: As of December 31, 2023, UPS concluded that its potential future obligation to pay coordinating benefits after the CSPF exhausts its SFA funds was immaterial, indicating a substantial reduction in long-term liability.",
        "Step 4: From evidence_source_a, UPS noted that it may have an obligation to pay coordinating benefits previously earned by employees in the CSPF, which could materially affect its financial condition if the CSPF became insolvent. However, the SFA payment eliminated this risk."

Separately, the 2021 divestiture of UPS Freight triggered an interim remeasurement of the UPS Retirement Plan's assets and liabilities, resulting in an actuarial gain of $2.1 billion.

Environmental and legal matters\n\nThe Company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing its use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal  combustion  engines.  We  have  made,  and  will  continue  to  make,  significant  research  and  development  and  capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards.\n\nWe are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. When  it  is  probable  we  will  pay  remedial  costs  at  a  site,  and  those  costs  can  be  reasonably  estimated,  we  accrue  the investigation, remediation, and operating and maintenance costs against our earnings. We accrue costs based on consideration of  currently  available  data  and  information  with  respect  to  each  individual  site,  including  available  technologies,  current applicable laws and regulations, and prior remediation experience.

Where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved, we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs. In formulating the estimate of probable costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance  companies  or  others.  We  reassess  these  accrued  amounts  on  a  quarterly  basis.  The  amount  recorded  for environmental remediation is not material and is included in Accrued expenses.

We  have instituted processes to address the allegations. While we are still discussing resolution of these allegations with IBAMA, the initial notice from IBAMA included a proposed fine of approximately $300,000.

However, the table indicates $1,111 million is categorized under Level 2, which includes only the portion of Corporate Stock explicitly classified as Level 2 ($1,104 million is Level 1, and $7 million is Level 2). Therefore, $803 (Federal Government Securities) + $1,069 (Bonds and Debentures) + $7 (Preferred Stock) = $1,879 million is the full Level 2 amount.",

      "answer": "3M adopted a new accounting principle in the first quarter of 2021 that changed how it calculates the market-related value of fixed income securities in its pension and postretirement plans. Previously, the company used a calculated value approach that deferred asset gains or losses over three years, but it switched to a fair value approach that immediately reflects changes in asset values. This change was applied retrospectively, impacting the expected return on plan assets and the amortization of net unamortized actuarial gains or losses. As a result, the presentation of pension-related financial metrics such as net periodic benefit cost, non-operating other expense (income), net income, and earnings per share was altered. Additionally, this change affected consolidated other comprehensive income, retained earnings, and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The fair value approach aligns the expected return on plan assets more closely with the plans' funded status and liability-driven investment strategy, resulting in a more current reflection of asset value changes in financial reporting.",

The trust assets were restricted from use in 3M's operations and were only used for the redemption of the Third Lien Notes that occurred in May 2020.\n\n## Floating Rate Notes\n\nAt various times, 3M has issued floating rate notes containing put provisions. 3M would be required to repurchase these securities at various prices ranging from 99 percent to 100 percent of par value according to the reduction schedules for each security. In December 2004, 3M issued a forty-year $60 million floating rate note, with a rate based on a floating LIBOR index. Under the terms of this floating rate note due in 2044, holders have an annual put feature at 100 percent of par value from 2014 and every anniversary thereafter until final maturity. Under the terms of the floating rate notes due in 2027, 2040 and 2041, holders have put options that commence ten years from the date of issuance and each third anniversary thereafter until final maturity at prices ranging from 99 percent to 100 percent of par value. For the periods presented, 3M was required to repurchase an immaterial amount of principal on the aforementioned floating rate notes.\n\n## NOTE 13. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\n\nAs discussed in Note 1, effective in the first quarter of 2021, 3M made a change in accounting principle for net periodic pension and postretirement plan cost. This impacted the expected return on plan assets and the amortization of net unamortized actuarial gains or losses expense components of net periodic benefit cost. This change was applied retrospectively to all periods presented within 3M's financial statements.\n\n3M has company-sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the United States. In total, 3M has over 75 defined benefit plans in 28 countries. Pension benefits associated with these plans generally are based on each participant's years of service, compensation, and age at retirement or termination. The primary U.S. defined-benefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective January 1, 2009. The Company also provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for its U.S. employees who reach retirement age while employed by the Company and were employed by the Company prior to January 1, 2016. Most international employees and retirees are covered by government health care programs. The cost of company-provided postretirement health care plans for international employees is not material and is combined with U.S. amounts in the tables that follow.\n\nThe Company has made deposits for its defined benefit plans with independent trustees. Trust funds and deposits with insurance companies are maintained to provide pension benefits to plan participants and their beneficiaries. There are no plan assets in the non-qualified plan due to its nature. For its U.S. postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans, the Company has set aside amounts at least equal to annual benefit payments with an independent trustee.\n\nThe Company also sponsors employee savings plans under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. These plans are offered to substantially all regular U.S. employees. For eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2009, employee 401(k) contributions of up to 5% of eligible compensation matched in cash at rates of 45% or 60%, depending on the plan in which the employee participates. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2009, receive a cash match of 100% for employee 401(k) contributions of up to 5% of eligible compensation and receive an employer retirement income account cash contribution of 3% of the participant's total eligible compensation. All contributions are invested in a number of investment funds pursuant to the employees' elections. Employer contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans were $231 million, $201 million and $186 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 3M subsidiaries in various international countries also participate in defined contribution plans. Employer contributions to the international defined contribution plans were $117 million, $103 million and $96 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nIn May 2019 (as part of the 2019 restructuring actions discussed in Note 5), the Company began offering a voluntary early retirement incentive program to certain eligible participants of its U.S. pension plans who met age and years of pension service requirements. The eligible participants who accepted the offer and retired by July 1, 2019 received an enhanced pension benefit. Pension benefits were enhanced by adding one additional year of pension service and one additional year of age for certain benefit calculations. Approximately 800 participants accepted the offer and retired before July 1, 2019. As a result, the Company incurred a $35 million charge related to these special termination benefits in the second quarter of 2019.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company recognized a non-operating $32 million settlement expense in its U.S. non-qualified pension plan. The charge is related to lump sum payments made to employees at retirement. The settlement expense is an accelerated recognition of past actuarial losses.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2020, as a result of the divestiture of the drug delivery business, the Company recognized a curtailment in its United Kingdom Pension Plan. The resulting re-measurement of the pension plan funded status reduced long-term prepaid",

The discount rate used to calculate present value is 3M's incremental borrowing rate or, if available, the rate implicit in the lease. 3M determines the incremental borrowing rate for leases using a portfolio approach based primarily on the lease term and the economic environment of the applicable country or region.\n\nAs a lessee, the Company leases distribution centers, office space, land, and equipment. Certain 3M lease agreements include rental payments adjusted annually based on changes in an inflation index. 3M's leases do not contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nCertain leases include one or more options to renew, with terms that can extend the lease term up to five years. 3M includes options to renew the lease as part of the right of use lease asset and liability when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise the option. In addition, certain leases contain fair value purchase and termination options with an associated penalty. In general, 3M is not reasonably certain to exercise such options.\n\nFor the measurement and classification of its lease agreements, 3M groups lease and non-lease components into a single lease component for all underlying asset classes. Variable lease payments primarily include payments for non-lease components, such as maintenance costs, payments for leased assets used beyond their noncancellable lease term as adjusted for contractual options to terminate or renew, additional payments related to a subsequent adjustment in an inflation index, and payments for non-components such as sales tax. Certain 3M leases contain immaterial variable lease payments based on number of units produced.\n\n## Change in Accounting Principle for Determining Net Periodic Pension and Postretirement Plan Cost\n\nIn the first quarter of 2021, 3M changed the method it uses to calculate the market-related value of fixed income securities included in its pension and other postretirement plan assets. The market-related value is used to determine the expected return on plan assets and the amortization of net unamortized actuarial gains or losses expense components of net periodic benefit cost. The Company previously used the calculated value approach for all plan assets, deferring over three years the impact on these amounts of asset gains or losses that differed from expected returns. 3M changed to the fair value approach for calculating market-related value for the fixed income class of plan assets, which does not involve deferring the impact of excess plan asset gains or losses in the determination of these two components of net periodic benefit cost. 3M considers the use of the fair value approach preferable to the calculated value approach as it results in a more current reflection of impacts of changes in value of these plan assets in the determination of net periodic benefit cost. Additionally, given the plans' liability-driven investment strategy whereby the changes in value of the fixed income plan assets should offset changes in the value of the plans' liabilities, this approach more closely aligns the expected return on plan assets expense component with the value reflected in the plans' funded status. This change was applied retrospectively to all periods presented within 3M's financial statements. The change did not impact consolidated operating income or net cash provided by operating activities but did impact the previously reported portion of pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost (benefit) that was included within non-operating other expense (income) along with related consolidated income items such as net income and earnings per share. Other impacts included related changes to previously reported consolidated other comprehensive income, retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and associated line items within the determination of net cash provided by operating activities. For classes of plan assets other than fixed income investments, the Company continues to use the calculated value approach to determine their market-related value.",

Those include considerations made in the valuation of certain acquired identifiable definite-lived and indefinite-lived assets as a result of business combinations as well as considerations in impairment assessments of goodwill.\n\n## Acquisition of certain identifiable definite-lived and indefinite-lived assets\n\nIn conjunction with an acquisition of a business, the Company records identifiable definite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired at their respective fair values as of the date of acquisition. The corresponding fair value estimates for these assets acquired include projected future cash flows, associated discount rates used to calculate present value, asset life cycles, royalty rates, and customer retention rates. The fair value calculated for indefinite-lived intangible assets such as certain tradenames, in addition to intangible assets that are definite-lived such as patents, customer relationships, tradenames and other technology-based assets may change during the finalization of the purchase price allocation, due to the significant estimates used in determining their fair value. As a result, the Company may make adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded for certain items as part of the purchase price allocation subsequent to the acquisition, not to exceed one year after the acquisition date, until the purchase accounting allocation is finalized. Changes in factors that may impact projected future cash flows, discount rates, customer preferences, and other estimates above, as well as underlying market and overall economic conditions, among other items, cause these estimates to be subject to uncertainty.\n\n## Assessments of goodwill\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, 3M goodwill totaled approximately $13.5 billion. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, as further discussed below, and is tested between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. If future non-cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3M would expect that only a portion of the goodwill would be impaired.\n\nImpairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but are required to be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. At 3M, reporting units correspond to a division. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit's net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, and the loss would equal that difference. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined based on a market approach using comparable company information such as EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) multiples. 3M also performs a discounted cash flow analysis for certain reporting units where the market approach indicates additional review is warranted. Where applicable, the discounted cash flow analysis uses projected cash flows that are based on sales growth and terminal value assumptions, among other factors. Changes in reporting unit earnings, comparable company information, and expected future cash flows, as well as underlying market and overall economic conditions, among other factors, make these estimates subject to uncertainty.\n\nAs described in Note 19, effective in the first quarter of 2021, the Company changed its business segment reporting. For changes that resulted in reporting unit changes, the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units, the results of which were immaterial. In conjunction with the change in segment reporting, 3M completed an assessment indicating no resulting goodwill impairment existed. The discussion that follows relates",

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS\n\nThe 2016 Stock Incentive Plan of Honeywell International Inc. and its A ffiliates (2016 Plan) and 2016 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Honeywell International Inc. (2016 Directors Plan) were both approved by the shareowners at the A nnual M eeting of Shareowners effective on A pril 25, 2016. A s of December 31, 2024, there were 27.1 million and 0.8 million shares of Honeywell common stock available for future grants under terms of the 2016 Plan and 2016 Directors Plan, respectively.\n\n## STOCK OPTIONS\n\nThe exercise price, term, and other conditions applicable to each option granted under the Company's stock plans are generally determined by the M anagement Development and Compensation Committee of the Board. The exercise price of stock options is set on the grant date and may not be less than the fair market value per share of the Company's stock on that date. The fair value is recognized as an expense over the employee's requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the award). Options generally vest over a four-year period and expire after 10 years.\n\nThe fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on our common stock and historical volatility of the Company's common stock. The Company used a M onte Carlo simulation model to derive an expected term which represents an estimate of the time options are expected to remain outstanding. Such model uses historical data to estimate option exercise activity and post-vest termination behavior. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\n\nThe following table summarizes the impact to the Consolidated Statement of Operations from stock options:\n\n",

      "answer": "The total increase in Restricted Stock/RSUs expense from 2022 ($59M) to 2024 ($85M) was $26M. Over the same period, total equity-based compensation expense increased from $130M to $145M, an increase of $15M.

The decrease in 2021 was attributable to elevated e-commerce spending and a reduction in business-to-business activity in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Business-to-business shipments increased 9.4%, primarily in our Ground commercial product, as business activity largely recovered from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAverage daily volume in our Next Day Air product increased as a result of the increase in business-to-business activity from SMBs and large customers. Higher residential demand also contributed to the growth in Next Day Air. Deferred volume decreased but remained slightly above pre-pandemic levels, with shifts in customer mix impacting product demand.\n\nSurePost average daily volume decreased 10.7%, driven by declines in volume from large customers. Ground commercial volume increased 7.0%, with growth in all customer segments.\n\n## Rates and Product Mix\n\nOverall revenue per piece increased in all customer segments, driven by increases in base rates and the increase in commercial volume discussed above. Revenue per piece was favorably impacted by the growth in SMB volume resulting from continued execution of our strategy, and from demand-related and fuel surcharges. Rates for ground and air services increased an average of 4.9% in December 2020, and our SurePost rates also increased at that time. We anticipate demand-related surcharges will remain largely unchanged in 2022.\n\nRevenue per piece for our Next Day Air and Deferred products increased as a result of the factors described above. The increase was slightly offset by the impact of a reduction in average billable weight per piece. Revenue per piece for our Ground product increased due to an increase in average billable weight per piece in addition to the factors described above.\n\nWe are focused on continuing to grow revenue per piece through execution of our strategy.\n\n## Fuel Surcharges\n\nWe apply a fuel surcharge on our domestic air and ground services that is adjusted weekly. The air fuel surcharge is based on the U.S. Department of Energy's ('DOE') Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel, while the ground fuel surcharge is based on the DOE's On-Highway Diesel Fuel Price.

      "answer": "UPS evaluates uncertain tax positions using a two-step process that directly affects the recognition of tax benefits or additional charges to the tax provision. First, it determines whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained on audit, based on available evidence. Second, it measures the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. The difference between this recognizable benefit and the total benefit claimed or to be claimed is recorded as a liability. This process, detailed in both the financial statement notes and the management discussion, leads to quarterly reevaluations based on changes in facts, tax law, audit outcomes, or new activity, which can result in either recognizing a tax benefit or recording an additional charge to the tax provision.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - UPS uses a two-step process for uncertain tax positions: (1) recognition based on likelihood of sustaining the position on audit and (2) measurement of the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The same two-step process is reiterated, emphasizing that changes in facts, tax law, audit outcomes, or new audit activity trigger reevaluations that may result in recognizing a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both chunks confirm that the estimation methodology for uncertain tax positions directly influences UPS's financial reporting by determining when and how much tax benefit or liability is recognized, with quarterly reassessments ensuring alignment with current conditions."

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nWorkers' compensation, automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely resolve. Consequently, actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve a claim. Several factors can affect the actual cost, or severity, of a claim, including the length of time the claim remains open, trends in healthcare costs, the results of any related litigation and changes in legislation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in a future year for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from actuarial projections. All these factors can result in revisions to actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results. We believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate, but actual experience in claim frequency and/or severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations.\n\nWe also sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees. Liabilities and expenses related to these plans are based on estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans, global health events, anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation.\n\n## Pension and Postretirement Benefits\n\nWe incur certain employment-related expenses associated with pension and postretirement medical benefits. These pension and postretirement medical benefit costs for company-sponsored defined benefit plans are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies, including discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, healthcare cost trend rates, inflation, compensation increase rates, mortality rates and coordination of benefits with plans not sponsored by UPS. Actuarial assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis, unless circumstances require an interim remeasurement of any of our plans.\n\nWe recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of a corridor (defined as 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plan's projected benefit obligation) in Investment income (expense) and other upon remeasurement of a plan. The remaining components of pension expense, primarily service and interest costs and the expected return on plan assets, are recorded ratably on a quarterly basis.\n\nWe recognize expense for required contributions to defined contribution plans quarterly, and we recognize a liability for any contributions due and unpaid within Accrued group welfare and retirement plan contributions .\n\nWe participate in a number of trustee-managed multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements. Our contributions to these plans are determined in accordance with the respective collective bargaining agreements. We recognize expense for the contractually required contribution for each period, and we recognize a liability for any contributions due and unpaid within Accrued group welfare and retirement plan contributions .\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIncome taxes are accounted for on an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, we generally consider all expected future events other than proposed changes in the tax law or rates. Valuation allowances are provided if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Our current accounting policy for releasing income tax effects from other comprehensive income is based on a portfolio approach.\n\nWe recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. Once it is determined that the position meets the recognition threshold, the second step requires us to estimate and measure the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. The difference between the amount of recognizable tax benefit and the total amount of tax benefit from positions filed or to be filed with the tax authorities is recorded as a liability for uncertain tax benefits. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction, tax credits, benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as tax, interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period.\n\nWe assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely.\n\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.

      "answer": "The use of activity-based costing methods directly affects the presentation of depreciation and amortization totals for UPS's reportable segments by determining how expenses are allocated between segments. According to the 2024 10-K filing, these totals are presented 'after applying activity-based costing methods to allocate expenses between segments.' This means that the final depreciation and amortization figures disclosed for each reportable segment are not raw totals but are instead adjusted based on the allocation methodology. Changes in these estimates directly impact the amount of expense allocated to each segment and therefore the operating profit of each reporting segment.",

Non-GAAP adjusted cost per piece is calculated as non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses in a period divided by total volume for that period. Because non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses exclude costs or charges that we do not consider a part of underlying business performance when monitoring and evaluating the operating performance of our business units, making decisions to allocate resources or in determining incentive compensation awards, we believe this is the appropriate metric on which to base reviews and evaluations of the efficiency of our operational performance.\n\n## Expense Allocations\n\nCertain operating expenses are allocated between our operating segments using activity-based costing methods. These activity-based costing methods require us to make estimates that impact the amount of each expense category that is attributed to each segment. Changes in these estimates directly impact the amount of expense allocated to each segment and therefore the operating profit of each reporting segment.

      "answer": "The Forcepoint business contributed to an increase in RTX's other non-reportable segment sales in 2020 compared to 2019. However, the operating profit for the same category decreased in 2020 due to the impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by operating profit from Forcepoint. The Forcepoint business was acquired as part of the Raytheon Merger in April 2020 and was subsequently sold in January 2021. This disposal affected inter-segment eliminations, as the Raytheon Merger had initially increased inter-segment sales, and the removal of Forcepoint from RTX\u2019s portfolio reduced the need for such eliminations in 2021.",

T hese statements include the accounts of all majority-owned subsidiaries and v ariable interest entities that are required to be consolidated. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions hav e been eliminated. As described in Note 23, we operate in three reportable segments: Commercial Airplanes (BCA), Defense, Space &amp; Security (BDS), and Global Serv ices (BGS). We added a new financial statement line item to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for cash inv ested in Supplier notes receiv able and reclassified the corresponding amounts in the prior period financial statements to conform to the current period presentation.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (GAAP)  requires  management  to  make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of rev enues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\n## Operating Cycle\n\nFor  classification  of  certain  current  assets  and  liabilities,  we  use  the  duration  of  the  related  contract  or  program  as  our  operating  cycle,  which  is generally longer than one year.\n\n## Revenue and Related Cost Recognition\n\nCommercial  aircraft  contracts The  majority  of  our  BCA  segment  rev enue  is  deriv ed  from  commercial  aircraft  contracts.  For  each  contract,  we determine  the  transaction  price  based  on  the  consideration  expected  to  be  receiv ed.  We  allocate  the  transaction  price  to  each  commercial  aircraft performance obligation based on relativ e standalone selling prices adjusted by an escalation formula as specified in the customer agreement. Rev enue is recognized for each commercial aircraft performance obligation at the point in time when the aircraft is completed and accepted by the customer. We use program accounting to determine the amount reported as cost of sales.\n\nPayments for commercial aircraft sales are receiv ed in accordance with the customer agreement, which generally includes a deposit upon order and additional  payments  in  accordance  with  a  payment  schedule,  with  the  balance  being  due  immediately  prior  to  or  at  aircraft  deliv ery. Adv ances  and progress billings (contract liabilities) are normal and customary for commercial aircraft contracts and not considered a significant financing component as they are intended to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract.\n\nLong-term contracts Substantially  all  contracts  at  BDS  and  certain  contracts  at  BGS  are  long-term  contracts  with  the  U.S.  gov ernment  and  other customers that generally extend ov er  sev eral  years.  Products  sales  under  long-term  contracts  primarily  include  fighter  jets,  rotorcraft,  cybersecurity products,  surv eillance  suites,  adv anced  weapons,  missile  defense,  military  deriv ativ e  aircraft,  satellite  systems  and  modification  of  commercial passenger aircraft to cargo freighters.

UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\n\nNone.\n\n## ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\n\nOur ability to attract and retain customers, efficiently operate our businesses, ex ecute our DRIVE transformation, including Network 2.0, and compete effectively increasingly depend in part upon the sophistication, security, and reliability of our technology network, including our ability to provide features of service that are important to our customers, to protect our confidential business information and the information provided by our customers, and to maintain customer confidence in our ability to protect our systems and to provide services consistent with their ex pectations.\n\n## Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\n\nFedEx has an information technology ('IT') risk management process designed to identify and manage risk within its IT environment, including cybersecurity. The IT risk management process is based on an established framework for identification, measurement, and monitoring of cybersecurity and other risk areas and supplements our Enterprise Risk Management ('ERM') process and framework. Our IT risk management, ERM, and compliance teams collaborate to regularly evaluate and manage cybersecurity-related risks using various tools and services. Leveraging components from multiple industry frameworks and best practices such as the International Organization for Standardization 27001 and National Institute of Standards and Technology ('NIST') standards, including the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, our cybersecurity program prioritizes governance, identification, protection, detection, response, and remediation measures.\n\nWe regularly assess our cybersecurity program's capabilities and tools to help us enhance reliability and scan our environment for vulnerabilities. Our IT risk management team, including our Corporate Vice President - Chief Information Security Officer ('CISO'), communicates with senior management on the cybersecurity risk posture of our IT assets, strives to ensure consistent risk remediation activities, and monitors the effectiveness of our IT-related controls. In addition, our internal audit team performs reviews of our information security organization to help ensure controls are operating effectively and as designed.\n\nEnterprise-wide information security training (including with respect to cybersecurity), supplemented by awareness programs, is crucial for risk reduction and safeguarding customer, employee, and company information. We provide training to employees and certain third-party contractors based on access to our network, risk, roles, policies, standards, and behaviors, which is updated to address emerging technology and security issues.\n\nWe periodically engage with assessors, consultants, auditors, and other third parties to review and improve our cybersecurity program. Compliance with regulatory requirements involves regular third-party assessments. Our processes are also designed to address cybersecurity risks associated with third-party service providers, including risk assessment and due diligence during selection and oversight. Key third parties undergo regular assessments to gauge cybersecurity control effectiveness, with heightened review of those with access to non-public data.",

          "chunk_text": "## FEDEX CORPORATION\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\norganizational redesign was implemented in phases with full legal implementation effective June 1, 2024. One FedEx will help facilitate our DRIVE transformation program to improve long-term profitability.\n\nFedEx is making progress with Network 2.0, as the company has implemented Network 2.0 optimization in more than 50 locations in the U.S. Contracted service providers will handle the pickup and delivery of packages in some locations while employee couriers will handle others.\n\nWe incurred costs associated with our business optimization activities of $582 million ($444 million, net of tax , or $1.77 per diluted share) in 2024 and $273 million ($209 million, net of tax , or $0.81 per diluted share) in 2023. The costs incurred in 2024 were primarily related to professional fees and severance, and are included in Corporate, other, and eliminations, FedEx Express, and FedEx Ground. The costs incurred in 2023 were primarily related to consulting services, severance, professional fees, and idling our operations in Russia, and are included in Corporate, other, and eliminations and FedEx Express. We did not incur costs associated with our business optimization activities in 2022.\n\nIn 2021, FedEx Express announced a workforce reduction plan in Europe related to the network integration of TNT Express. The plan affected approximately 5,000 employees in Europe across operational teams and back-office functions and was completed during 2023. We incurred costs of $36 million ($27 million, net of tax, or $0.11 per diluted share) in 2023 and $278 million ($214 million, net of tax , or $0.80 per diluted share) in 2022 associated with our business realignment activities. These costs are related to certain employee severance arrangements. Payments under this program totaled approximately $118 million in 2023 and approximately $225 million in 2022. The cumulative pre-tax cost of our business realignment activities was approximately $430 million. We did not incur any costs related to business realignment activities in 2024.\n\nIn June 2024, FedEx Express announced a workforce reduction plan in Europe as part of its ongoing measures to reduce structural costs. The plan will impact between 1,700 and 2,000 employees in Europe across back-office and commercial functions. The execution of the plan is subject to a consultation process that is expected to occur over an 18-month period in accordance with local country processes and regulations. We expect the pre-tax cost of the severance benefits and legal and professional fees to be provided under and related to the plan to range from $250 million to $375 million in cash ex penditures. These charges are expected to be incurred through fiscal 2026 and will be classified as business optimization ex penses.\n\nUSE OF ESTIMATES . The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Management makes its best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to management. Areas where the nature of the estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated include self-insurance accruals, retirement plan obligations, long-term incentive accruals, tax  liabilities, loss contingencies, litigation claims, impairment assessments on long-lived assets (including goodwill) that rely on projections of future cash flows, and purchase price allocations.\n\n## NOTE 2: RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE\n\nNew accounting rules and disclosure requirements can significantly affect our reported results and the comparability of our financial statements. We believe the following new accounting guidance is relevant to the readers of our financial statements.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') issued Accounting Standards Update ('ASU') 2022-04, Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations, which requires a buyer in a supplier finance program (e.g., reverse factoring) to disclose sufficient information about the program to allow a user of financial statements to understand the program's nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period, and potential magnitude. The amendments do not affect the recognition, measurement, or financial statement presentation of obligations covered by supplier finance programs. We adopted this standard effective June 1, 2023 (fiscal 2024). The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements or internal controls. See Note 1 for further discussion about our supplier finance program obligations.",

      "question": "How could the implementation risks of Network 2.0 affect FedEx's ability to achieve its 2040 carbon neutrality goal, given the potential diversion of management focus and operational resources?",
      "answer": "The implementation risks of Network 2.0 could negatively impact FedEx's ability to achieve its 2040 carbon neutrality goal by diverting management focus and operational resources away from sustainability initiatives. According to the 10-K filing, the DRIVE transformation program\u2014which includes Network 2.0\u2014requires significant management attention, which may be 'diverted from day-to-day business operations,' potentially disrupting business and slowing progress on other strategic priorities. Additionally, the filing states that FedEx may 'prioritize other business, social, governance, or sustainable investments and/or initiatives... over the achievement of our calendar 2040 goal based on economic, regulatory, or social factors, business strategy, or other reasons.' This implies that if Network 2.0 encounters delays, legal challenges, or unforeseen expenses, FedEx may reallocate resources and strategic emphasis away from carbon neutrality efforts, thereby increasing the risk of not meeting its 2040 target. Failure to achieve this goal could harm FedEx\u2019s reputation, stakeholder relationships, and access to financing.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - FedEx has a stated goal of achieving carbon neutrality for global operations by 2040 and acknowledges that this goal depends on the successful execution of strategies such as vehicle electrification and sustainable fuel procurement.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The DRIVE transformation program, which includes Network 2.0, could 'divert management attention from day-to-day business operations,' and may result in unforeseen costs, legal challenges, and delays.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - If the DRIVE transformation and Network 2.0 implementation consume significant management time and financial resources, FedEx may deprioritize or delay its sustainability strategies, thereby jeopardizing progress toward the 2040 carbon neutrality goal."

Business' of this Annual Report under the caption 'Regulation.'\n\nWe may also incur additional expenses as a result of U.S. and international regulators requiring additional disclosures regarding GHG emissions and other environmental matters including, but not limited to, the European Sustainability Reporting Standards and Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and the final rules adopted by the SEC in March 2024. Furthermore, many countries and U.S. states in which we operate or are subject to regulation have adopted, or are expected to adopt, additional requirements related to the disclosure of GHG emission and related matters. In many cases these requirements differ and may conflict from country to country, increasing our costs or requiring significant management time and attention. Additionally, we could be subject to climate litigation or regulatory enforcement actions, as groups, individuals, and governmental authorities affected by climate change seek to recover climate-related damages from entities they perceive as being partially responsible for human-induced climate change because of the emission of GHGs from their operations.\n\nMoreover, even without such regulation, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the GHGs emitted by companies in the airline and transportation industries could harm our reputation, reduce customer demand for our services, especially our air express services, and increase our liability. Finally, given the broad and global scope of our operations and our susceptibility to global macroeconomic trends, we are particularly vulnerable to the physical risks of climate change that could affect all of humankind, such as shifts in weather patterns and world ecosystems.\n\nWe may be unable to achieve or demonstrate progress on our goal of carbon neutrality for our global operations by calendar 2040. In 2021, we announced a goal to achieve carbon neutrality for our global operations by calendar 2040. Achievement of this goal depends on our execution of operational strategies relating to vehicle electrification; sustainable fuel procurement; fuel conservation and aircraft modernization; facilities; sustainable customer solutions; and potentially voluntary carbon offset credits.\n\nExecution of these strategies, as well as demonstrable progress on and achievement of our calendar 2040 goal, is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. See 'The Environment' under 'Item 1. Business' of this Annual Report for information on our review of our previously disclosed Federal Express pickup-and-delivery purchase goals. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our ability to successfully implement our business strategy, effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and achieve the anticipated benefits and associated cost savings of such strategies and actions; the availability and cost of, and our ability to acquire, alternative fuel vehicles, alternative fuels, fuel-efficient aircraft, global electrical charging infrastructure and requisite power grid capacity, off-site renewable energy, and other materials and components, many of which are not presently in existence or available at scale to meet the required global and regulatory demand creating intense competition that may significantly increase the costs; unforeseen production, design, operational, and technological difficulties; the outcome of research efforts and future technology developments, including the ability to scale projects and technologies on a commercially competitive basis such as carbon sequestration and/or other related processes; compliance with, and changes or additions to, global and regional regulations, taxes, charges, mandates, or requirements relating to GHG emissions, carbon costs, or climate-related goals; labor-related regulations and requirements that restrict or prohibit our ability to impose requirements on third parties who provide contracted transportation for our transportation networks; the availability of incentives to enhance the production and affordability of alternative fuel vehicles, alternative fuels, global electrical charging infrastructure and requisite power grid capacity, and other materials and components; adapting products to customer preferences and customer acceptance of sustainable supply chain solutions and potentially increased prices for our services; and the actions of competitors and competitive pressures. Purchase of carbon offset credits to meet our 2040 carbon neutrality goal could add significant fluctuating annualized costs due to the uncertain price of carbon and any voluntary or regulatory schemes to offset emissions, lead to increased regulatory attention, and inhibit the development of other carbon reduction approaches that we may otherwise pursue. There also is a risk that any voluntary carbon offset credits purchased, even if accepted by regulators, could be viewed by third parties as not sufficiently reflecting real, verifiable, and additional G HG  reductions, leading to reputational harm.\n\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute our strategies and achieve or demonstrate progress on our calendar 2040 goal of carbon neutrality for our global operations. Additionally, we may determine that it is in our best interests to prioritize other business, social, governance, or sustainable investments and/or initiatives (such as our DRIVE transformation program, including Network 2.0) over the achievement of our calendar 2040 goal based on economic, regulatory, or social factors, business strategy, or other reasons. Failure to achieve or demonstrate progress on our calendar 2040 goal could damage our reputation and customer and other stakeholder relationships. Further, given investors' and other stakeholders' increased focus related to ESG matters, such a failure could cause large stockholders to reduce their ownership of FedEx common stock and limit our access to financing. Such conditions could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as on the price of our common stock.\n\nOur inability to quickly and effectively restore operations following adverse weather or a localized disaster or disturbance in a key geography could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

The actual amount and timing of costs to be incurred and related cost savings and reductions to our permanent cost structure resulting from these initiatives and enhancements may differ from our current expectations and estimates. These initiatives and enhancements could also result in asset impairment charges and changes to our tax liabilities and deferred tax balances and subject us to litigation. If we are not able to successfully implement our DRIVE transformation our future financial results will suffer and we may not be able to achieve our financial performance goals.\n\nAll of these factors could adversely affect FedEx's results of operations and negatively affect the price of our common stock. In addition, at times the attention of certain members of our management may be focused on the DRIVE transformation and diverted from day-to-day business operations, which may disrupt our business.\n\nA significant data breach or other disruption to our technology infrastructure could disrupt our operations and result in the loss of critical sensitive or confidential information, adversely affecting our reputation, business, or results of operations. Our ability to attract and retain customers, efficiently operate our businesses, execute our DRIVE transformation, and compete effectively increasingly depend in part upon the sophistication, security, and reliability of our technology network, including our ability to provide features of service that are important to our customers, to protect our confidential business information and the information provided by our customers, and to maintain customer confidence in our ability to protect our systems and to provide services consistent with their expectations. For example, we rely on information technology to receive shipment information in advance of physical receipt of packages, to track items that move through our delivery systems, to efficiently plan deliveries, to clear shipments through customs, to execute billing processes, and to track and report financial and operational data. We are subject to risks imposed by data breaches and operational disruptions, both random and targeted, including through cyberattack or cyberintrusion, ransomware attack, malware attack, or denial of service attack by computer hackers, foreign governments and state-sponsored actors, cyber terrorists and hacktivists, cyber criminals, malicious employees or other insiders of FedEx or third-party service providers, and other groups and individuals. Data breaches and other technology disruptions of companies and governments continue to increase as the number, intensity, and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased and we, our customers, and third parties increasingly store and transmit data by means of connected information technology systems. Additionally, risks such as code anomalies, 'Acts of God,' transitional challenges in migrating operating company functionality to our FedEx enterprise automation platforms, data leakage, cyber-fraud, and human error pose a direct threat to our products, services, systems, and data and could result in unauthorized or block legitimate access to sensitive or confidential data regarding our operations, customers, employees, and suppliers, including personal information.\n\nThe technology infrastructure of acquired businesses, as well as their practices related to the use and maintenance of data, could also present issues that we were not able to identify prior to the acquisition.

          "chunk_text": "Our cash and cash equivalents balance at May 31, 2024 includes $2.5 billion of cash in foreign jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy. We are able to access the majority of this cash without a material tax  cost and do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these funds impairs our ability to meet our U.S. domestic debt or working capital obligations.\n\nOur capital expenditures for 2025 are expected to be approximately $5.2 billion, in line with 2024, as we continue to reduce our capital intensity relative to revenue. Aircraft spend is expected to decline, partially offset by increased investments in network optimization and modernization of our facilities. Our ex pected capital expenditures for 2025 include continued investments related to Network 2.0, as well as the continued modernization of the Federal Express Memphis World Hub and expansion and modernization of the Federal Express Indianapolis Hub. Our expected capital expenditures for 2025 also include $1.3 billion for delivery of aircraft and related equipment and progress payments toward future aircraft deliveries at Federal Express.\n\nWe have several aircraft modernization programs under way that are supported by the purchase of Boeing 777 Freighter and Boeing 767-300 Freighter aircraft. These aircraft are significantly more fuel-efficient per unit than the aircraft types previously utilized, and these ex penditures are necessary to achieve significant long-term operating savings and to replace older aircraft. Our ability to delay the timing of these aircraft-related ex penditures is limited without incurring significant costs to modify existing purchase agreements.\n\nWe have additional obligations as part of our ordinary course of business, beyond those committed for capital expenditures, which consist of debt obligations, lease obligations, and obligations and commitments for purchases of goods and services. Refer to Note 6, Note 7, and Note 18 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information. In addition, we have certain tax positions that are further discussed in Note 12 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We do not have any guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.\n\nWe have a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') that allows us to sell, in one or more future offerings, any combination of our unsecured debt securities and common stock and allows pass-through trusts formed by Federal Express to sell, in one or more future offerings, pass-through certificates.\n\nThe Three-Year Credit Agreement and the Five-Year Credit Agreement expire in March 2027 and March 2029, respectively. Each of the Credit Agreements has a $125 million letter of credit sublimit. The Credit Agreements are available to finance our operations and other cash flow needs. See Note 6 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of the terms and significant covenants of the Credit Agreements.\n\nWe made voluntary contributions of $100 million to our tax-qualified U.S. domestic pension plan ('U.S. Pension Plan') in June 2024 and anticipate making $700 million of additional voluntary contributions during the remainder of 2025. There are currently no required minimum contributions to our U.S. Pension Plan, and we maintain a credit balance related to our cumulative excess voluntary pension contributions over those required that exceeds $3.0 billion. The credit balance is subtracted from plan assets to determine the minimum funding requirements. Therefore, we have the flexibility to eliminate all required contributions to our principal U.S. Pension Plan for several years. Our U.S. Pension Plan has ample funds to meet expected benefit payments.\n\nOn June 10, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.38 per share of common stock. The dividend was paid on July 9, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 24, 2024. Each quarterly dividend payment is subject to review and approval by our Board of Directors, and we evaluate our dividend payment amount on an annual basis. There are no material restrictions on our ability to declare dividends, nor are there any material restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us in the form of cash dividends, loans, or advances.\n\nStandard &amp; Poor's has assigned us a senior unsecured debt credit rating of BBB, a Certificates rating of AA-, a commercial paper rating of A-2, and a ratings outlook of 'stable.' Moody's Investors Service has assigned us an unsecured debt credit rating of Baa2, a Certificates rating of Aa3, a commercial paper rating of P-2, and a ratings outlook of 'stable.' Our interest ex pense may increase in the event of a reduction in our credit rating. If our unsecured debt or commercial paper ratings are reduced to below investment grade, our access to the capital markets may become limited.\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements.

The costs incurred in 2024 were primarily related to professional fees and severance, and are included in Corporate, other, and eliminations, FedEx Express, and FedEx Ground. The costs incurred in 2023 were primarily related to consulting services, severance, professional fees, and idling our operations in Russia, and are included in Corporate, other, and eliminations and FedEx Express. We did not incur costs associated with our business optimization activities in 2022.\n\nIn 2021, FedEx Express announced a workforce reduction plan in Europe related to the network integration of TNT Express.

These costs are related to certain employee severance arrangements. Payments under this program totaled approximately $118 million in 2023 and approximately $225 million in 2022.

The plan will impact between 1,700 and 2,000 employees in Europe across back-office and commercial functions. The execution of the plan is subject to a consultation process that is expected to occur over an 18-month period in accordance with local country processes and regulations. We expect the pre-tax cost of the severance benefits and legal and professional fees to be provided under and related to the plan to range from $250 million to $375 million in cash ex penditures.

Our business strategy also provides flexibility in structuring our network to align with varying macroeconomic conditions and customer demand for the market segments in which the customer operates, allowing us to leverage and manage change. Volatility, uncertainty, and innovation have become the norms in the global transportation market, and we are able to use our flex ibility to accommodate changing conditions in the global economy.\n\nFor more than 50 years, we built networks that have created a differentiated and unmatched portfolio of services while continuously evolving to meet the changing needs of our customers and the market. With the recent significant growth of e-commerce and as our service mix continues to shift to deferred services, we are continuing to evolve to improve our operational efficiency and enhance profitability through one FedEx, Network 2.0 (our multi-year effort to improve the efficiency with which FedEx picks up, transports, and delivers packages in the U.S. and Canada), and DRIVE (our comprehensive program to improve long-term profitability). We are building a simplified experience to better serve our customers with enhanced capabilities and transforming to operate with more flexibility, efficiency, and intelligence.\n\nWe have implemented Network 2.0 in more than 50 locations in the U.S. and began the phased transition of all legacy FedEx Ground operations and personnel in Canada to Federal Express surface operations in April 2024. As we optimize our network under Network 2.0, Federal Express will continue to utilize both employee couriers and contracted service providers in U.S. surface operations using a market-by-market approach. Additionally, in 2024 we announced Tricolor, the redesign of the Federal Express international air network as part of the DRIVE program to improve efficiency and asset utilization. See 'Business Segments' below, 'Item 1A. Risk Factors,' and 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition' of this Annual Report for more information on one FedEx, Network 2.0, and DRIVE. One FedEx and Network 2.0 will leverage the strength of our networks, people, and assets in more efficient ways, enabling a distinct focus on air and international volume while facilitating a more holistic approach to how we move packages on the ground.\n\nInnovation inspired our start at FedEx over 50 years ago, and it is fueling our future as we combine logistics with digital intelligence. Leveraging the capabilities of FedEx Dataworks, developments in data and technology, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, are facilitating the execution of our DRIVE transformation by creating new opportunities to improve our operational efficiency. See 'Business Segments' below for more information. The size and scale of our global network gives us key insights into global supply chains and trends. This foundation provides an immense amount of data we can use to build better insights, improve the customer experience, and differentiate our service offerings. To fully harness the power of this data, FedEx Dataworks is focused on putting our data into context and using it to enhance the efficiency of the FedEx network and the end-to-end experience of our customers by making supply chains smarter for everyone.\n\nIn January 2024, we announced fdx, a fully integrated data-driven commerce platform that connects the entire customer journey. See 'Federal Express Segment Customer-Driven Technology - E-Commerce and Digital Solutions' below for more information. In early 2025 we formed a new enterprise-wide Data &amp; Technology team, which is focused on initiatives to streamline the technology used during the package delivery lifecycle; establish global standards across pickup-and-delivery, linehaul, sort, and clearance operations; and improve digital products and experiences for the FedEx enterprise and our customers.\n\n'Safety Above All' is the first and foremost value in every aspect of our business. We are committed to making our workplaces and communities safer for our team members, customers, and the public. This philosophy is embedded in our day-to-day work through rigorous policies, continual education and engagement, and investments in technology designed to prevent accidents.\n\nThrough our global transportation, information technology, and retail networks, we help to facilitate an ongoing and unprecedented expansion of customer access to goods, services, and information. We believe it would be extremely difficult, costly, and time-consuming to replicate our global network, which reflects decades of investment, innovation, and expertise, includes the world's largest all-cargo air fleet, and connects more than 99% of the world's gross domestic product. We continue to position our company and team members to facilitate and capitalize on this access and to achieve stronger long-term growth, productivity, and profitability.\n\nDuring 2024 and early 2025, we introduced and expanded a number of innovative solutions, advanced important long-term business initiatives, and made other important investments that benefit our customers, team members, communities, and other stakeholders, including:\n\n-   Completing our one FedEx consolidation plan to bring FedEx Ground and FedEx Services into Federal Express, becoming a single company operating a unified, fully integrated air-ground ex press network.\n-   Continuing DRIVE, our comprehensive program to improve our long-term profitability.\n-   Implementing Network 2.0 in more than 50 locations in the U.S. and beginning the phased implementation in Canada.",

For example, we rely on information technology to receive shipment information in advance of physical receipt of packages, to track items that move through our delivery systems, to efficiently plan deliveries, to clear shipments through customs, to execute billing processes, and to track and report financial and operational data. We are subject to risks imposed by data breaches and operational disruptions, both random and targeted, including through cyberattack or cyberintrusion, ransomware attack, malware attack, or denial of service attack by computer hackers, foreign governments and state-sponsored actors, cyber terrorists and hacktivists, cyber criminals, malicious employees or other insiders of FedEx or third-party service providers, and other groups and individuals. Data breaches and other technology disruptions of companies and governments continue to increase as the number, intensity, and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased and we, our customers, and third parties increasingly store and transmit data by means of connected information technology systems. Additionally, risks such as code anomalies, 'Acts of God,' transitional challenges in migrating operating company functionality to our FedEx enterprise automation platforms, data leakage, cyber-fraud, and human error pose a direct threat to our products, services, systems, and data and could result in unauthorized or block legitimate access to sensitive or confidential data regarding our operations, customers, employees, and suppliers, including personal information.\n\nThe technology infrastructure of acquired businesses, as well as their practices related to the use and maintenance of data, could also present issues that we were not able to identify prior to the acquisition.

      "answer": "The FAS/CAS operating adjustment decreased by $255 million in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to a $292 million decrease in CAS expense driven by higher discount rates from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. In 2023, the adjustment decreased further by $272 million compared to 2022, mainly due to changes in Raytheon's domestic pension plans effective December 31, 2022, which reduced both CAS expense and FAS service cost. These adjustments, which reflect differences in cost recognition patterns under FAS and CAS, are presented separately from segment results. Acquisition accounting adjustments, including amortization of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment fair value adjustments, are also excluded from management's evaluation of segment performance. Therefore, the Raytheon segment's reported financial performance does not include these pension-related or acquisition-related adjustments, which could affect the apparent profitability of the segment in a given year.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The change in FAS/CAS operating adjustment was $255 million in 2022 compared to 2021, driven by a $292 million decrease in CAS expense due to higher discount rates from ARPA.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - The change in FAS/CAS operating adjustment was $272 million in 2023 compared to 2022, driven by pension plan changes effective December 31, 2022, which reduced both CAS expense ($463M) and FAS service cost ($191M).",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b - FAS/CAS operating adjustments and acquisition accounting adjustments are not included in the evaluation of segment results, meaning the Raytheon segment's financial performance excludes these adjustments.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The cumulative effect of the FAS/CAS adjustments over two years shows a significant reduction in pension-related expenses under CAS, while acquisition-related amortization is also excluded from segment performance, meaning the Raytheon segment's reported results do not reflect these financial impacts."

      "answer": "Emerson reported total AspenTech operations revenue of $1,093 million for 2024. Maintaining AspenTech as a separate publicly traded entity requires Emerson to account for AspenTech's stock-based compensation separately, with pre-combination service periods factored into the purchase price allocation and post-combination service periods recognized as ongoing stock-based compensation expense over the remaining service period.",

        "Step 1: From Source A, extract the total 2024 revenue specifically attributed to AspenTech operations, which is $1,093 million.",

        "Step 4: Synthesize that because AspenTech remains a separate entity with its own equity compensation structure, Emerson must track and report compensation expenses related to AspenTech's post-combination service periods separately, creating an ongoing financial reporting obligation distinct from other business units."

      "answer": "Under ASC 805, Emerson allocates the fair value of AspenTech's stock-based compensation awards between pre- and post-combination service periods. The portion attributable to the pre-combination service period is included in the purchase price of the acquisition, while the post-combination portion is recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the remaining service period. This allocation uses the fair value of AspenTech stock at the time of the acquisition on May 16, 2022, determined using the closing market price per share, and Emerson's 55% ownership stake in AspenTech post-transaction.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, identify Emerson's 55% ownership stake in AspenTech after the acquisition on May 16, 2022, and the use of AspenTech's closing market price per share to determine fair value for the noncontrolling interest.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, identify the requirement under ASC 805 to allocate the fair value of stock-based compensation awards between pre-combination (included in purchase price) and post-combination (recognized as expense) periods.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize that the fair value of AspenTech's stock-based compensation awards is determined using the closing market price of AspenTech's stock at the acquisition date, and the allocation of this value depends on the service periods relative to the acquisition date.",
        "Step 4: Connect Emerson's 55% ownership and the fair value determination method from the first chunk to the ASC 805 allocation mechanism in the second chunk to explain how the compensation expense is split and accounted for."

      "answer": "Emerson's target allocation range for debt securities in U.S. plans is 60-70%, compared to a target allocation range of 65-75% for debt securities in Non-U.S. plans. This suggests that Emerson places a slightly higher emphasis on debt securities for Non-U.S. pension investments, potentially reflecting a more conservative risk management strategy in international markets where economic or political volatility might be a greater concern.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, extract the target allocation range for debt securities in U.S. plans (60-70%).",

          "chunk_text": "Industrial Software Business'), along with approximately $6.0 billion in cash to Heritage AspenTech stockholders, to create \"New AspenTech\" (defined as \"AspenTech\" herein). Upon closing of the transaction, Emerson owned 55 percent of the outstanding shares of AspenTech common stock (on a fully diluted basis). AspenTech and its subsidiaries now operate under Heritage AspenTech's prev ious name 'Aspen Technology, Inc.' and AspenTech common stock is traded on NASDAQ under AspenTech's previous stock ticker symbol 'AZPN.' Due to the timing of the acquisition, the results for the first half of fiscal 2022 do not include the results of Heritage AspenTech.\n\nSee Notes 4, 5 and 8 and Item 1A - \"Risk Factors\" for further information on acquisitions and div estitures.\n\n## COST OF SALES\n\nCost of sales for 2024 were $8,607, an increase of $869 compared with $7,738 in 2023, reflecting the impact of higher v olume and the Test &amp; Measurement acquisition. Gross profit was $8,885 in 2024 compared to $7,427 in 2023, while gross margin increased 1.8 percentage points to 50.8 percent, reflecting the Test &amp; Measurement acquisition and higher price partially offset by the impact from acquisition-related inv entory step-up amortization of $231, which negativ ely impacted margins by approximately 1.3 percentage points.\n\nCost of sales for 2023 were $7,738, an increase of $240 compared with $7,498 in 2022.

      "answer": "The Heritage AspenTech acquisition contributed $125 to Emerson's SG&A expenses in 2023, with $75 attributable to Emerson stock plans due to a higher share price and $50 attributable to AspenTech stock plans. This $125 increase was part of the overall $572 rise in SG&A expenses in 2023 compared to 2022, which was driven by the AspenTech acquisition and higher stock compensation expenses, partially offset by operating leverage on higher sales.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_b - In 2023, SG&A expenses increased by $572 compared with 2022, with $125 of that increase attributed to higher stock compensation expense from both AspenTech and Emerson stock plans.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Of the $125 stock compensation increase, $75 was due to Emerson stock plans (linked to a higher share price) and $50 was attributable to AspenTech stock plans.",

AspenTech, as defined in Note 4, operates as a separate publicly traded company and has v arious stock-based compensation plans, including stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock units, which are settled in their own common stock and are accounted for as equity awards. Restricted stock units and performance stock units generally v est ov er three years. In fiscal 2023 and 2024, the Company granted performance stock units with both a performance and serv ice condition. The performance condition relates to the attainment of predefined goals based on annual contract v alue and free cash flows. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the probability that the threshold performance goals will be achiev ed, if at all, and the anticipated lev el of attainment to determine the amount of compensation expense to record in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Option awards hav e been granted with an exercise price equal to the market closing price of AspenTech's stock on the trading day prior to the grant date. These options generally v est ov er four years and expire within sev en years or ten years of grant. AspenTech's policy is to issue new shares upon the exercise of v ested stock awards.\n\nPursuant to the terms of the transaction agreement between Emerson and Heritage AspenTech, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Heritage AspenTech common stock, whether vested or unvested, that was unexercised as of immediately prior to the closing date was conv erted into an option to acquire shares of AspenTech. Each conv erted option is subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the original option. In addition, each outstanding award of restricted stock units with respect to shares of Heritage AspenTech common stock that were unv ested as of immediately prior to the closing date was conv erted into an award of restricted stock units with respect to shares of AspenTech. Each conv erted restricted stock unit is also subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the original restricted stock unit.\n\nASC 805 required the Company to determine the fair v alue of the AspenTech share-based payment awards related to the replacement of the Heritage AspenTech share-based payment awards, and allocate the total fair v alue based on the serv ices that are attributable to the pre- and post-combination serv ice periods, respectiv ely. The portion that is attributable to the pre-combination serv ice period was considered part of the consideration transferred for Heritage AspenTech and included as part of the purchase price. The portion that is attributable to the post-combination serv ice period is recognized as stock-based compensation expense in the post-combination consolidated financial statements ov er the remaining requisite serv ice period.\n\n## AspenTech Stock Options\n\nAspenTech utilizes the Black-Scholes option v aluation model for estimating the fair v alue of options granted. The Black-Scholes option v aluation model incorporates assumptions regarding expected stock price v olatility, the expected life of the option, the risk-free interest rate, div idend yield and the market value of AspenTech's common stock. The expected stock price v olatility is determined based on AspenTech's stock's historic prices ov er a period commensurate with the expected life of the award. The expected life of an option represents the period for which options are expected to be outstanding as determined by historic option exercises and cancellations. The risk-free",

          "chunk_text": "## FedEx Ground Segment\n\n## Overview\n\nBy leveraging the FedEx brand, maintaining a low-cost structure, and efficiently using information technology and advanced automation systems, FedEx Ground continues to enhance its competitive position as a leading provider of business and residential money-back guaranteed ground package delivery services. As of July 15, 2022, the money-back guarantee for all FedEx Ground services remains temporarily suspended in order to balance our focus on service and safety. FedEx Ground serves customers in the North American small-package market, focusing on business and residential delivery of packages weighing up to 150 pounds. Ground service is provided to 100% of the continental U.S. population and overnight service of up to 400 miles to nearly 100% of the continental U.S. population. Service is also provided to nearly 100% of the Canadian population. In addition, FedEx Ground offers service to Alaska and Hawaii through a ground and air network operation coordinated with other transportation providers. FedEx Ground provides seven-day-per-week residential delivery to virtually all of the U.S. population.\n\nThe company offers FedEx Home Delivery service, which reaches 100% of U.S. residences. FedEx Home Delivery is dedicated to meeting the delivery needs of residential customers and provides routine Saturday and evening delivery and premium options such as day-specific, appointment, and signature delivery. Sunday delivery is also provided for virtually all of the U.S. population. FedEx Home Delivery brings unmatched services to residential shippers and their customers and is the first residential ground package delivery service to have offered a money-back guarantee. FedEx Ground Economy service is available for the consolidation and delivery of high volumes of low-weight, less time-sensitive business-to-consumer packages to any residential address or PO Box in the U.S.\n\n## Pricing\n\nFedEx Ground periodically publishes updates to the list prices for the majority of its services in its Service Guide. In general, U.S. shipping rates are based on the service selected, origin, destination, weight, size, any ancillary service charge, and whether the customer charged the shipment to a FedEx account. Effective January 3, 2022, FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery implemented a 5.9% average list price increase. FedEx Ground Economy average list prices also increased.\n\nTo manage demand and capacity constraints in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in June 2020 FedEx Ground implemented a series of surcharges generally applying to shipments that are oversized, unauthorized, or require additional handling; to residential packages for customers meeting a certain volume threshold; and to FedEx Ground Economy shipments. Specific applicable surcharges have been adjusted periodically since their implementation, and higher surcharges were applied during the 2022 holiday peak season. Effective January 17, 2022, the holiday peak surcharges were no longer in effect, and additional surcharges were applied to residential shipments for customers who met certain volume thresholds and to packages delivered or returned using FedEx Ground Economy services. These changes reflect incremental costs associated with the challenging operating environment, while enabling FedEx Ground to continue investing in service enhancement, equipment maintenance, technology innovations, and other areas to serve customers more effectively and efficiently.\n\nFedEx Ground has an indexed fuel surcharge, which is adjusted on a weekly basis. The fuel surcharge is based on a weekly fuel price from two weeks prior to the week in which it is assessed. Effective June 21, 2021, November 1, 2021, and April 4, 2022, the tables used to determine fuel surcharges at FedEx Ground were updated. See the 'Results of Operations and Outlook Consolidated Results - Fuel' section of 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition' of this Annual Report for more information.\n\n## Operations\n\nFedEx Ground operates a highly flexible network of over 680 sortation and distribution facilities, including approximately 160 fully automated stations, in the U.S. and Canada as of May 31, 2022. FedEx Ground conducts its operations primarily with more than 100,000 vehicles owned or leased by independent service providers. To provide FedEx Home Delivery service and FedEx Ground Economy service, FedEx Ground leverages its pickup operation and hub and linehaul network.\n\nIn recent years, FedEx Ground's network expansion has substantially increased the company's daily capacity through the addition of new facilities featuring the latest automated sorting technology as well as the expansion or relocation of existing hubs and other facilities. FedEx Ground has also made significant operational enhancements to ensure safe and reliable handling of large and heavy items. These changes include designing new facilities, adding equipment to certain facilities, and making other operational adjustments.",

          "chunk_text": "Through its many service offerings, FedEx Freight can match customers' time-critical needs with industry-leading transit times. With the expansion of FedEx electronic solutions, LTL shippers have the convenience of a single shipping and tracking solution for FedEx Freight, FedEx Express, and FedEx Ground. These solutions make freight shipping easier and provide customers easy access to their account information. The FedEx Freight Advance Notice feature available on FedEx Freight Priority shipments uses the company's innovative technology systems to proactively notify FedEx Freight customers via the internet, e-mail, or fax when a shipment may be delayed beyond its estimated delivery date, providing customers with greater visibility and control of their LTL freight shipments. Customers can also process cross-border LTL shipments to and from Canada and Mexico, as well as intraCanada and -Mexico shipments, through FedEx Ship Manager at fedex.com , FedEx Ship Manager Software, FedEx Ship Manager Server, and FedEx Web Services. Additionally, FedEx Freight A.M. Delivery offers freight delivery by 10:30 a.m. within and between the U.S. and Canada. FedEx Freight also offers LTL Select, a free cloud-based, multi-carrier transportation management system that provides customers with visibility into all available carriers and their pricing in one location, as well as the ability to book service and make payments.\n\nFedEx Freight Direct addresses the growing e-commerce market for heavy bulky products and supports ongoing collaboration between FedEx Freight and FedEx Ground. It has four service levels to meet customer needs, with basic and basic by appointment available to nearly 100% of the U.S. population and standard and premium available to 90% of the continental U.S. population.\n\nFedEx Freight continues to expand its use of DIM technology to more accurately capture freight profile, which improves the company's ability to cost and price shipments. FedEx Freight also uses radio frequency identification technology and customized software to improve shipment visibility on its docks and enhance custodial control at the handling unit level.\n\nAs of May 31, 2022, the FedEx Freight segment was operating more than 30,000 vehicles from a network of approximately 400 service centers and had approximately 47,000 employees. Lance D. Moll is the President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Freight, which is based in Memphis, Tennessee. FedEx Freight's primary competitors are YRC Worldwide Inc. (which includes YRC Regional Transportation and YRC Freight), XPO Logistics, Inc., Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc., ABF Freight (an ArcBest company), SAIA, Inc., and TFI International Inc.\n\nWe are currently bargaining with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters at one FedEx Freight facility.\n\n## Pricing\n\nFedEx Freight periodically publishes updates to the list prices for the majority of its services in its 100 Rules Tariff. In general, shipping rates are based on the service selected, origin, destination, weight, class, any ancillary service charge, and whether the customer charged the shipment to a FedEx account. On January 3, 2022, FedEx Freight implemented a 5.9% average list price increase for customers who use FXF PZONE and FXF EZONE rates and a 7.9% average list price increase for customers who use FXF 1000 and FXF 501. These increases apply for shipments within the U.S. and between the contiguous U.S. and Canada.\n\nIn order to manage demand and capacity constraints, beginning in July 2021 FedEx Freight implemented a peak surcharge applying to specific delivery points within the U.S. The peak surcharge has been adjusted periodically since implementation. Effective November 15, 2021, FedEx Freight increased applicable length surcharges. Effective January 17, 2022, FedEx Freight added a surcharge that applies when a pickup is performed and no shipment is tendered to the carrier.\n\nFedEx Freight has an indexed fuel surcharge, which is adjusted on a weekly basis. The fuel surcharge is based on a weekly fuel price from two days prior to the day in which it is assessed. Effective November 1, 2021 and April 4, 2022, the tables used to determine fuel surcharges at FedEx Freight were updated. See the 'Results of Operations and Outlook - Consolidated Results Fuel' section of 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition' of this Annual Report for more information.\n\n## FedEx Services Segment\n\nFedEx Services provides our other companies with sales, marketing, information technology, communications, customer service, technical support, billing and collection services, and certain other back-office support. Through FedEx Services, we provide a convenient single point of access for many customer support functions, enabling us to more effectively sell the entire portfolio of transportation services and to help ensure a consistent and outstanding experience for our customers.\n\nBrie A. Carere and Robert B. Carter each serve as the Co-President and Co-Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Services, which is based in Memphis, Tennessee. As of May 31, 2022, the FedEx Services segment had approximately 15,000 employees.",

      "question": "How does GE's unrealized gain on its interest in AerCap in 2021 relate to the uncertainties GE highlights regarding its equity ownership positions in forward-looking statements?",
      "answer": "In 2021, GE reported a pre-tax unrealized gain of $711 million related to its interest in AerCap. However, in its forward-looking statements, GE highlights uncertainties regarding its equity ownership positions, including those in AerCap, which could materially affect its financial results. These uncertainties include the success in executing asset dispositions, market volatility, changes in the value of financial assets, and the impact of macroeconomic conditions. Therefore, while GE realized a significant unrealized gain from AerCap in 2021, the future value and benefits from this equity position remain subject to risks that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially from expectations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - GE reported a pre-tax unrealized gain of $711 million related to its interest in AerCap in 2021.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - GE acknowledges uncertainties regarding its equity ownership positions, including AerCap, which could materially affect its financial performance due to market volatility, macroeconomic conditions, and execution risks.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The $711 million unrealized gain from AerCap in 2021 is contrasted with GE's forward-looking risk disclosures, which indicate that such gains are not guaranteed and are subject to various financial and market risks that could reduce or eliminate the benefit."

      "answer": "In 2022, Boeing reported a value of $107 million for 757 aircraft leased under sales-type leases. The complete absence of the 757 aircraft from the 2023 leasing portfolio in the disclosures indicates a strategic shift where Boeing has either fully divested its 757 sales-type lease assets or discontinued the program, signaling a contraction or reallocation of resources away from this aircraft model in its leasing business.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, we identify that in 2022, the 757 Aircraft under sales-type leases had a reported value of $107 million.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, we observe that in the 2023 data, the 757 Aircraft line is present but contains no value, indicating the asset is no longer part of the active leasing portfolio.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The removal of the 757 from the 2023 leasing disclosures implies a strategic change in Boeing\u2019s leasing business, specifically regarding the 757 model, suggesting either full divestiture or program phase-out."

      "question": "How does Lockheed Martin's obligation to provide consulting support under international offset agreements impact its ability to recover costs on U.S. government contractual commitments in 2024?",
      "answer": "Lockheed Martin's international offset agreements, which may include obligations to provide consulting support to in-country projects, require cash outlays and investments that are often outside the company\u2019s control, such as those tied to joint ventures. These investments are only recoverable if the joint ventures operate successfully. Simultaneously, Lockheed Martin has $64.3 billion in purchase obligations related to U.S. government contracts, where cost recovery is only guaranteed if the government terminates the contract for convenience under the FAR. Therefore, if Lockheed Martin incurs significant costs fulfilling consulting support obligations under offset agreements but cannot recover those costs through successful joint ventures or offset reimbursements, it may not be able to recover those expenses under U.S. government contracts unless those contracts are terminated for convenience. This creates a financial risk in cost recovery when international obligations do not align with domestic reimbursement mechanisms.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Lockheed Martin's offset agreements may require consulting support to in-country projects, and the company may not control the joint ventures through which these obligations are fulfilled, increasing the risk of non-recovery of investments.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Lockheed Martin has $64.3 billion in purchase obligations related to U.S. government contracts, and cost recovery is only guaranteed if the government terminates the contract for convenience under the FAR.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The financial risk arises because offset-related investments (e.g., consulting support) may not be recoverable unless joint ventures succeed, and U.S. government contracts only allow cost recovery under specific termination conditions, which may not align with the timing or success of international obligations."

Higher interest rates increase the borrowing costs on new debt and could affect the fair value of our investments. Interest rates also impact our pension. For example, higher interest rates generally reduce the measure of our gross pension obligations while lower interest rates increase it.\n\nPublic health. We face a wide variety of risks related to public health crises, epidemics, pandemics or similar events. If a new health epidemic or outbreak were to occur, we could experience broad and varied effects similar to the impact of COVID-19, including adverse impacts to our workforce and supply chain, inflationary pressures and increased costs, schedule or production delays, market volatility and other financial ramifications. If any of these were to occur, our future results and performance could be adversely impacted.\n\n## International sales may pose different economic, regulatory, competition and other risks.\n\nInternational sales present risks that are different and potentially greater than those encountered in our U.S. business. In 2024, 26% of our total net sales were associated with international customers. International sales are subject to numerous political and economic factors, including changes in foreign national priorities, foreign  government  budgets,  global  economic  conditions,  and  fluctuations  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  the  possibility  of  trade  sanctions  and  other government actions, regulatory requirements, significant competition, taxation, and other risks associated with doing business outside the U.S. Sales of military products and services and any associated industrial development (offset) agreements are subject to U.S. export regulations and foreign policy, and there could be significant delays or other issues in reaching definitive agreements for announced programs. See the Risk Factor 'G eopolitical, macroeconomic and public health events and conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.' Competition for international sales is intense, including from international  manufacturers  whose  governments  sometimes  provide  research  and  development  assistance,  marketing  subsidies  and  other  assistance  for  their products and services.\n\nOur international business is conducted through FMS contracted through the U.S. G overnment and by direct commercial sales (DCS) to international customers. FMS contracts with the U.S. G overnment are subject to the FAR and the DFARS. Because the U.S. G overnment functions as an intermediary in FMS sales, we are reliant on, and could be adversely impacted by, the capacity and speed of the DoD's administration of requests from non-U.S. countries to convert requests to sales. In contrast, DCS transactions represent sales directly to international customers and are subject to U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including product testing, import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, investments, tax ation, repatriation of earnings, ex change controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations, and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Control Reform Act of 2018. While we have extensive policies in place to comply with such laws and regulations, failure by us, our employees or others working on our behalf to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative,  civil,  or  criminal  liabilities,  including  suspension,  debarment  from  bidding  for  or  performing  government  contracts,  or  suspension  of  our  ex port privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We frequently team with international subcontractors and suppliers who also are exposed to similar risks.\n\nWe believe DCS transactions present a higher level of potential risks because they involve direct commercial relationships with parties with which we typically have less familiarity. Additionally, international procurement and local country rules and regulations, contract laws and judicial systems differ from those in the U.S. and,  in  some  cases,  may  be  less  predictable  than  those  in  the  U.S.,  which  could  impair  our  ability  to  enforce  contracts  and  increase  the  risk  of  adverse  or unpredictable outcomes, including the possibility that certain matters that would be considered civil matters in the  U.S. are treated as criminal matters in other countries.\n\nIn  conjunction  with  defense  procurements,  some  international  customers  require  contractors  to  comply  with  industrial  cooperation  regulations,  including entering into industrial participation, industrial development or localization agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements (also known as offset contracts), as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services. These offset agreements generally extend over several years and obligate the contractor to perform certain  commitments,  which  may  include  in-country  purchases,  technology  transfers,  local  manufacturing  support,  consulting  support  to  in-country  projects, investments in joint ventures and financial support projects, and preference for local suppliers or subcontractors. The customer's expectations in respect of the scope of offset commitments can be substantial, including high-value content, and may exceed existing local technical capability. Failure to meet these commitments, which can be subjective and outside of our control, may result in significant penalties, and could lead to a reduction in sales to a country. Furthermore, some of our existing offset agreements are dependent upon the successful operation of joint ventures that we do not control and involve products and services that are outside of our core business, which may increase the risk of breaching our obligations, exposing us to compliance risks of the joint venture, and impairing our ability to recover  our  investment.  For  more  information  on  our  industrial  development  obligations,  including  the  notional  value  of  our  remaining  industrial  development obligations  and  potential  penalties  for  non-compliance,  see  'Contractual  Commitments'  in  Management's  Discussion  and Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and Results of Operations.",

For  additional  information  about  obligations  and  our  future  minimum contribution requirements for these plans, see 'Note 11 - Postretirement Benefit Plans' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts related to other liabilities represent the contractual obligations for certain long-term liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2024. Such amounts mainly include expected payments under non-qualified pension plans, environmental liabilities and deferred compensation plans.\n\nPurchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages. Such agreements and contracts may, for example, be related to direct materials, obligations to subcontractors and outsourcing arrangements. Total purchase obligations for operating activities in the preceding table include approximately $64.3 billion related to contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our U.S. G overnment customers. The U.S. G overnment generally would be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related contracts 'for convenience' under the FAR, subject to available funding. This also would be true in cases where we perform subcontract work for a prime contractor under a U.S. G overnment contract. The termination for convenience language also may be included in contracts with foreign, state and local governments. We also have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions, including contracts with commercial customers.\n\nThe majority  of  our  capital  ex penditures  for  2024  and  those  planned  for  2025  are  for  equipment,  facilities  infrastructure  and  information  technology.  The amounts above in the table represent the portion of expected capital expenditures to be incurred in 2025 and beyond that have been obligated under contracts as of December 31, 2024 and not necessarily total capital expenditures for future periods. Expenditures for equipment and facilities infrastructure are generally incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. For example, we have projects underway at Aeronautics to support classified development programs and at RMS to support our Sikorsky helicopter programs; and we have projects underway to modernize certain of our facilities. We also incur capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software.\n\nWe also may enter into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries. These agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash, including transferring  technology,  providing  manufacturing  and  other  consulting  support  to  in-country  projects  and  the  purchase  by  third  parties  (e.g. , our  vendors)  of supplies from in-country vendors.  These agreements also may be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, establishment of joint ventures with local companies and building or leasing facilities for in-country operations. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction  of  the  original  amount  in  the  offset agreement. Satisfaction of our offset obligations are included in the estimates of our total costs to complete the contract and may impact our sales, profitability and cash  flows.  Our  ability  to  recover  investments  on  our  consolidated  balance  sheet  that  we  make  to  satisfy  offset  obligations  is  generally  dependent  upon  the successful operation of",

Once the debt ceiling is reached, Treasury may have to use extraordinary measures to prevent default. Treasury's available cash and any extraordinary measures taken should delay the risk of default for at least several months after the end of the first quarter of 2025. In the upcoming months, the new Congress will return to the task of funding the U.S. G overnment for the balance of FY  2025. Significant differences that must be resolved include the different allocations as noted above and policy matters that arose during consideration of the CR and the underlying bills.\n\nWe anticipate the federal budget will continue to be subject to debate and compromise shaped by, among other things, the new Administration and Congress, the global security environment, inflationary pressures, and macroeconomic conditions. The result may be shifting funding priorities, which could have material impacts on defense spending broadly and our programs.\n\n## Geopolitical and E conomic E nvironment\n\nWe operate in a complex and evolving global security environment and our business is affected by geopolitical and security issues. Russia's invasion of Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East and heightened tension in the Pacific region have elevated global security concerns resulting in increased interest for our products and services as countries seek to improve their security posture. In this context, the U.S. G overnment, our largest customer, continues to align its budget with the defense priorities set forth in the 2022 National Defense Strategy. In addition, security assistance provided by the U.S. G overnment and its allies to Ukraine has increased  U.S.  G overnment and allied demand to replenish  U.S. stockpiles, resulting in additional and potential future orders, including for the ramp-up in production capacity for certain products. We continue to expect additional orders over the next several years attributable to the global threat environment. We operate primarily in a long-cycle business and the U.S. G overnment has been focused on increasing industry capacity to meet demand. We continue to work with the U.S. Government and our supply chain to evaluate increases in capacity at our operations to anticipate potential demand and enable us to deliver critical capabilities.\n\nOur  business  and  financial  performance  is  also  affected  by  general  economic  conditions.  We  continue  to  ex perience  supply  chain  challenges,  including supplier shortages and performance issues. These issues have delayed certain customer deliveries, have been a limiting factor on our ability to ramp up production in response to customer demand for certain products and have caused out-of-sequence manufacturing, which increases costs and decreases operational efficiency. In addition, elevated levels of inflation and macroeconomic conditions present risks for us, our suppliers and the stability of the broader defense industrial base. Certain costs, including rising labor rates and supplier costs, have increased as a result of inflation, and have adversely affected our margins on certain programs. In addition, some suppliers are reducing the duration of pricing validity of their proposals to us or seeking to reopen pricing on existing agreements, which is operationally challenging and increases the risk of cost volatility. We continue to work to mitigate challenges caused by the supply chain or current macroeconomic environment on our business, including by supporting small business and at-risk suppliers, deploying resources to work with our supply chain, securing materials and support by executing  long-term  contracts,  enforcing  existing  contract  terms,  identifying  alternative  sources,  collaborating  with  our  customers  to  address  industry-wide challenges, and optimizing our supply chain organization through digital transformation and workforce development. If we experience significant supply chain issues or high rates of inflation, and are unable to successfully mitigate the impact, our future profits, margins and cash flows, particularly for ex isting fix ed-price contracts, may be adversely affected.  Inflation and higher interest rates can also constrain the overall purchasing power of our customers for our products and services potentially impacting future orders, especially in a budget constrained environment. We remain committed to our ongoing efforts to increase the efficiency of our operations and improve the cost competitiveness and affordability of our products and services, which may, in part, offset cost increases from inflation.\n\n## International Business\n\nA key component of our strategic plan is to grow our international sales. To accomplish this growth, we continue to focus on strengthening our relationships internationally through partnerships and joint technology efforts. Our international business is conducted either by FMS contracted through the U.S. G overnment or by direct commercial sales (DCS) to international customers. In 2024, approximately 73% of our sales to international customers were FMS and about 27% were DCS. Additionally, in 2024, substantially all of our sales from international customers were in our Aeronautics, MFC and RMS business segments. Space's sales from international customers were not material in 2024. See Item 1A - Risk Factors for a discussion of risks related to international sales.\n\nIn 2024, international customers accounted for 32% of Aeronautics' net sales. There continues to be strong international interest in the F-35 program, which includes commitments from the U.S. G overnment and seven international partner countries and twelve FMS customers, as well as expressions of interest from other countries. The U.S. G overnment and the partner countries continue to work together on the design, testing, production and sustainment of the F-35 program. Other areas of",

Once the debt ceiling is reached, Treasury may have to use extraordinary measures to prevent default. Treasury's available cash and any extraordinary measures taken should delay the risk of default for at least several months after the end of the first quarter of 2025. In the upcoming months, the new Congress will return to the task of funding the U.S. G overnment for the balance of FY  2025. Significant differences that must be resolved include the different allocations as noted above and policy matters that arose during consideration of the CR and the underlying bills.\n\nWe anticipate the federal budget will continue to be subject to debate and compromise shaped by, among other things, the new Administration and Congress, the global security environment, inflationary pressures, and macroeconomic conditions. The result may be shifting funding priorities, which could have material impacts on defense spending broadly and our programs.\n\n## Geopolitical and E conomic E nvironment\n\nWe operate in a complex and evolving global security environment and our business is affected by geopolitical and security issues. Russia's invasion of Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East and heightened tension in the Pacific region have elevated global security concerns resulting in increased interest for our products and services as countries seek to improve their security posture. In this context, the U.S. G overnment, our largest customer, continues to align its budget with the defense priorities set forth in the 2022 National Defense Strategy. In addition, security assistance provided by the U.S. G overnment and its allies to Ukraine has increased  U.S.  G overnment and allied demand to replenish  U.S. stockpiles, resulting in additional and potential future orders, including for the ramp-up in production capacity for certain products.

We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistics, system integration and cybersecurity services. We serve both U.S. and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil and commercial applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. G overnment. As described in 'Note 3 - Information on Business Segments', we operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, MFC, RMS and Space.\n\nBasis of presentation -  These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of subsidiaries we control and variable interest entities if we are the primary beneficiary. We eliminate intercompany balances and transactions in consolidation. We classify certain assets and liabilities as current utilizing the duration of the related contract or program as our operating cycle, which is generally longer than one year. This primarily impacts receivables, contract assets, inventories, and contract liabilities. We classify all other assets and liabilities based on whether the asset will be realized or the liability will be paid within one year. Additionally, certain  prior  year  amounts  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  cash  flows  have  been  reclassified  within  operating  activities  to  conform  to  the  current  year's presentation. These reclassifications were not material and had no impact on total net cash provided by operating activities as previously reported.\n\nOn October 30, 2024, we closed our acquisition of Terran Orbital Corporation (Terran Orbital) for a purchase consideration of $314 million. We accounted for this acquisition as a 'step acquisition' (as defined in U.S. GAAP) and accordingly, $83 million of our previously held investments in Terran Orbital were included as part of the purchase consideration. The remaining purchase price of $231 million was paid with cash on hand (net of cash acquired). Terran Orbital became a whollyowned subsidiary and operates within our Space business segment. The purchase consideration of $314 million was allocated to the estimated fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill. As a result, we recorded goodwill of $298 million at our Space business segment. The final determination of the fair values of certain assets and liabilities will be completed within the measurement period of up to one year from the respective acquisition date. The financial results of Terran Orbital have been included within our operating results in the period post-acquisition.\n\nUse of estimates - We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In doing so, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ materially from these estimates. Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, accounting for sales and cost recognition; postretirement benefit plans; environmental liabilities and assets for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery; evaluation of  goodwill,  intangible  assets,  investments  and  other  assets  for  impairment;  income  tax es  including  deferred  income  tax es;  fair  value  measurements;  and contingencies.\n\nRevenue Recognition -The majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. G overnment and international customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. G overnment) for the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. For certain contracts that meet the foregoing requirements, primarily international direct commercial sale contracts, we are required to obtain certain regulatory approvals. In these cases, we recognize revenue when it is probable that we will receive regulatory approvals based upon all known facts and circumstances. We provide our products and services under fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts.\n\nUnder fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fix ed-price contracts have a performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance.\n\nCost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. Typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-fixedfee. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an",

      "question": "How does Caterpillar's use of historical claim rates in determining product warranty liabilities influence its financial obligations related to dealer loans guaranteed through the special-purpose corporation, and what would be the impact on Caterpillar's financial position if a 10% non-temporary decrease in the market value of equipment on operating leases occurred alongside an increase in warranty claims?",
      "answer": "Caterpillar uses historical claim rates to estimate future warranty costs, which directly affects its product warranty liability. This liability is updated monthly based on actual claim experience, and it ensures that Caterpillar can account for potential financial obligations tied to product warranties at the time of sale. Simultaneously, Caterpillar's financial services arm, Cat Financial, guarantees loans made by a special-purpose corporation (SPC) to Caterpillar dealers. If dealers face financial distress\u2014potentially due to broader market conditions such as lower equipment values\u2014they may default on these loans, triggering Caterpillar's obligation under the guarantee. A 10% non-temporary decrease in the market value of equipment on operating leases would result in approximately $75 million of additional annual depreciation expense. If this depreciation increase occurred alongside higher-than-expected warranty claims, Caterpillar would face dual financial pressures: higher operating expenses from depreciation and potentially higher warranty liabilities, which could strain cash flow and profitability.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Caterpillar determines product warranty liability by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory, with updates based on actual warranty experience.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Cat Financial guarantees dealer loans through an SPC, and is the primary beneficiary, consolidating the SPC's financials. If dealers face financial stress, Cat Financial may be obligated to perform under the guarantee.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_a - A 10% non-temporary decrease in the market value of equipment on operating leases would result in approximately $75 million of additional annual depreciation expense.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - If the $75 million depreciation increase coincides with higher warranty claims (due to increased product returns or defects), Caterpillar would face higher operating costs and increased liabilities, which could negatively affect profitability and cash flow."

      "answer": "The Heritage AspenTech acquisition led Emerson to identify a new segment in fiscal 2022, which combined the results of Heritage AspenTech and the Emerson Industrial Software Business. This new AspenTech segment caused a reclassification of prior year amounts in the Automation Solutions segment to conform to the new presentation. As a result, the Automation Solutions segment's historical results now exclude the Emerson Industrial Software Business, which is now part of the new AspenTech segment, thereby altering the reported performance of both segments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, the Heritage AspenTech acquisition caused Emerson to identify a new segment in fiscal 2022 that combined the results of Heritage AspenTech and the Emerson Industrial Software Business.",
        "Step 2: Also from evidence_source_a, the Automation Solutions segment's prior-year results were reclassified to align with the new segment structure, meaning the Emerson Industrial Software Business's results were no longer reported under Automation Solutions.",
        "Step 3: From evidence_source_b, the AspenTech segment's increased backlog in fiscal 2022 was directly tied to the Heritage AspenTech acquisition, further indicating the acquisition had a material effect on segment-level reporting and performance metrics.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize: The acquisition not only introduced a new segment but also required a retrospective reclassification of Automation Solutions' historical results, thereby altering the financial and operational narrative of that segment."

The new segment reflects the combined results of Heritage AspenTech and the Emerson Industrial Software Business (see Note 4 for further details). The results for this new segment include the historical results of the Emerson Industrial Software Business (which were previously reported in the Automation Solutions segment), while results related to the Heritage AspenTech business only include periods subsequent to the close of the transaction on May 16, 2022. Prior year amounts for the Automation Solutions segment have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\n\nThe Company now reports four segments: Automation Solutions, AspenTech ; and Climate Technologies and Tools &amp; Home Products , which together comprise the Commercial &amp; Residential Solutions business.\n\nThe Automation Solutions segment enables process, hybrid and discrete manufacturers to maximize production, protect personnel and the environment, reduce project costs, and optimize their energy efficiency and operating costs through a broad offering of integrated solutions, software, services and products, including measurement and analytical instrumentation, industrial valves and equipment, and process control software and systems. Markets served include oil and gas, refining, chemicals, power generation, life sciences, food and beverage, automotive, pulp and paper, metals and mining, and municipal water supplies. The segment's major product offerings are described below.\n\n- Measurement &amp; Analytical Instrumentation products measure the physical properties of liquids or gases in a process stream and communicate this information to a process control system or other software applications, and analyze the chemical composition of process fluids and emissions to enhance quality and efficiency, as well as environmental compliance.",
