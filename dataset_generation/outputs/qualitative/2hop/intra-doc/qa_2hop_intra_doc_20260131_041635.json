      "question": "How does the growth in Google Play's revenue contribution, as part of non-advertising revenues, potentially affect Google's overall profit margins, given the differing margin profiles between advertising and non-advertising revenue streams?",
      "answer": "Google Play generates revenues from app sales, in-app purchases, and digital content, and is a growing component of Google's non-advertising revenues. According to the 2022 10-K filing, non-advertising revenues\u2014including those from Google Play, hardware, and Google Cloud\u2014are increasing and may adversely affect overall profit margins because the margins on these revenues vary significantly and may be lower than those on advertising revenues. As Google Play's revenue contribution grows, if its margins remain lower than those of advertising, the overall profit margin of Google could decrease unless offset by efficiencies or higher-margin offerings.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Google Play generates revenues from sales of apps, in-app purchases, and digital content.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - As Google Play's revenue grows within the non-advertising segment, its potentially lower margins could impact Google's overall profitability unless mitigated."

We see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful and make people's lives easier by combining the best of our AI, software and hardware. This potential is reflected in our latest generation of hardware products such as Pixel 5a 5G and Pixel 6 phones, the Fitbit Charge 5, Chromecast with Google TV, and the new Google Nest Cams and Nest Doorbell. Creating products that people rely on every day is a journey that we are investing in for the long run.\n\nThe key to building helpful products for users is our commitment to privacy, security, and user choice. We protect user privacy and security with products that are secure by default and private by design, and that keep users in control of their data.  Our  privacy-preserving  technologies  safeguard  individual  privacy  and  enhance  data  protection.  As  the  Internet evolves, so does our approach to privacy and security. We continue to enhance our anti-malware features in Chrome and drive improvements such as auto-delete controls that automatically delete web and app searches after 18 months. And we continue to keep users and their passwords safe through advances like our built-in password manager.\n\n## How we make money\n\nWe have built  world-class  advertising  technologies  for  advertisers,  agencies,  and  publishers  to  power  their  digital marketing businesses. Our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses through our wide range of products across devices and formats, and we aim to ensure positive user experiences by serving the right ads at the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies.\n\nGoogle Services generates revenues primarily by delivering both performance and brand advertising that appears on Google Search &amp; other properties, YouTube and Google Network partners' properties (\"Google Network properties\"). We continue  to  invest  in  both  performance  and  brand  advertising  and  seek  to  improve  the  measurability  of  advertising  so advertisers understand the effectiveness of their campaigns.\n\n- Performance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click on, leading to direct engagement with advertisers. Performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving measurable results. Our ads tools allow performance advertisers to create simple text-based ads.\n- Brand advertising helps enhance users' awareness of and affinity for advertisers' products and services, through videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across various devices. We help brand advertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brand-building marketing campaigns.\n\nWe have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web. We focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways, including filtering out invalid traffic, removing billions of bad ads from our systems every year, and closely monitoring the sites, apps, and videos where ads appear and blocklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content.\n\nWe continue to look to the future and are making long-term investments that we expect to grow revenues beyond advertising, including revenues from Google Play, hardware, and YouTube non-advertising.\n\n- Google Play generates revenues from sales of apps and in-app purchases and digital content sold in the Google Play store.\n- Hardware generates revenues from sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, Pixel phones, and other devices.\n- YouTube non-advertising generates revenues from YouTube Premium and YouTube TV subscriptions and other services.\n\n## Google Cloud\n\nGoogle  was  a  company  built  in  the  cloud.  We  continue  to  invest  in  infrastructure,  security,  data  management, analytics,  and  AI.  We  see  significant  opportunity  in  helping  businesses  utilize  these  strengths  with  features  like  data migration,  modern  development  environments,  and  machine  learning  tools  to  provide  enterprise-ready  cloud  services, including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace. Google Cloud Platform enables developers to build, test, and deploy  applications  on  its  highly  scalable  and  reliable  infrastructure.  Google  Workspace  collaboration  tools  -  which include apps like Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, Meet and more - are designed with real-time collaboration and machine intelligence  to  help  people  work  smarter.  Because  more  and  more  of  today's  digital  experiences  are  being  built  in  the cloud, Google Cloud products help businesses of all sizes take advantage of the latest technology advances to operate more efficiently.\n\n- Google Cloud Platform generates revenues from infrastructure, platform and other services.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nInternational  revenues  represent  a  significant  portion  of  our  revenues  and  are  subject  to  fluctuations  in  foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings.\n\n## \u00b7 The portion of revenues that we derive from non-advertising revenues is increasing and may adversely affect margins.\n\nNon-advertising revenues have grown over time. We expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our offerings through products and services like Google Cloud, Google Play, hardware products, and YouTube subscriptions. We currently derive non-advertising revenues primarily from sales of apps and in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud services and subscription and other services. A number of Other Bets initiatives are in their initial development stages, and as such, revenues from these businesses could be volatile.  In  addition,  the  margins  on  these  revenues  vary  significantly  and  may  be  lower  than  the margins on our advertising revenues.\n\n## \u00b7 As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and capital expenditures.\n\nWe continue to make significant R&amp;D investments in areas of strategic focus across Google Services, Google Cloud and Other Bets. We also expect to continue to invest in land and buildings for data centers and offices, and information technology assets, which includes servers and network equipment, to support the long-term growth of our business. In addition, acquisitions and strategic investments contribute to the breadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in  engineering  and  other  functional  areas,  and  build  strong  partnerships  around  strategic  initiatives.  For  example,  in January 2021 we closed the acquisition of Fitbit, Inc. for $2.1 billion, which is expected to help spur innovation in wearable devices.\n\n## \u00b7 We face continuing changes in regulatory conditions, laws, and public policies, which could affect our business practices and financial results.\n\nChanges in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range of topics and related legal matters have resulted in fines and caused us to change our business practices. As these global trends continue, our cost of doing business may increase, and our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products or services may be limited. Examples include the antitrust complaints filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and a  number  of  state Attorneys  General,  the  Digital  Markets Act  in  Europe,  and  various  legislative  proposals  in  the  U.S. focused on large technology platforms.\n\n## \u00b7 Our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them.\n\nOur employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. We expect to continue hiring talented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs. For additional information see Culture and Workforce in Part I, Item 1 'Business.'\n\n## Seasonality and other\n\nOur  advertising  revenues  are  affected  by  seasonal  fluctuations  in  internet  usage,  advertising  expenditures,  and underlying  business  trends,  such  as  traditional  retail  seasonality.  Additionally,  our  non-advertising  revenues,  including those  generated  from  Google  Cloud,  Google  Play,  hardware,  and  YouTube,  may  be  affected  by  fluctuations  driven  by changes in pricing, digital content releases, fee structures, new product and service launches, other market dynamics, as well as seasonality.\n\n## Revenues and Monetization Metrics\n\n## Google Services\n\nGoogle Services revenues consist of revenues generated from advertising ('Google advertising') as well as revenues from other sources ('Google other revenues').\n\n## Google Advertising\n\nGoogle advertising revenues are comprised of the following:\n\n- Google Search &amp; other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n- YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and",

We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible  loss.  We  evaluate  developments  in  our  legal  matters  that  could  affect  the  amount  of  liability  that  has  been previously  accrued,  and  the  matters  and  related  reasonably  possible  losses  disclosed,  and  make  adjustments  as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters.\n\nWith respect to our outstanding matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range of reasonably  possible  loss  will  not,  either  individually  or  in  aggregate,  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.\n\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\n\n## Non-Income Taxes\n\nWe are  under  audit  by  various  domestic  and  foreign  tax  authorities  with  regards  to  non-income  tax  matters.  The subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the sale of  our  products  and  services  in  these  jurisdictions  and  the  tax  treatment  of  certain  employee  benefits.  We  accrue  nonincome taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss.

As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, no shares were issued or outstanding.\n\n## Class A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock\n\nOur Board of Directors has authorized three classes of stock, Class A and Class B common stock, and Class C capital stock. The rights of the holders of each class of our common and capital stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to 10 votes per share. Class C capital stock has no voting rights, except as required by applicable law. Shares of Class B common stock may be converted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically convert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock.\n\n## Share Repurchases\n\nIn April 2021, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $50.0 billion of its Class C stock. In July 2021, the Alphabet board approved an amendment to the April 2021 authorization, permitting the company to  repurchase  both  Class  A  and  Class  C  shares  in  a  manner  deemed  in  the  best  interest  of  the  company  and  its stockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading prices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. As of December 31, 2021, $17.4 billion remains available for Class A and Class C share repurchases under the amended authorization.\n\nIn accordance with the authorizations of the Board of Directors of Alphabet, during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, we repurchased and subsequently retired 21.5 million and 20.3 million aggregate shares for $31.1 billion and $50.3 billion, respectively. Of the aggregate amount repurchased and subsequently retired during 2021, 1.2 million shares were Class A stock for $3.4 billion.\n\n## Stock Split Effected in Form of Stock Dividend ('Stock Split')\n\nOn February 1, 2022, the Company announced that the Board of Directors had approved and declared a 20-for-one stock split in the form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the Company's Class A, Class B, and Class C stock.

Revenues  related  to  cloud  services  provided  on  a  consumption  basis  are  recognized  when  the customer utilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the cloud services.\n\n## Google Other Revenues\n\nGoogle other revenues consist of revenues from:\n\n- Google Play, which includes sales of apps and in-app purchases and digital content sold in the Google Play store;\n- hardware, which includes sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel phones;\n- YouTube non-advertising, which includes YouTube Premium and YouTube TV subscriptions; and\n- other products and services.\n\nAs it relates to Google other revenues, the most significant judgment is determining whether we are the principal or agent for app sales and in-app purchases through the Google Play store. We report revenues from these transactions on a net  basis  because  our  performance  obligation  is  to  facilitate  a  transaction  between  app  developers  and  end  users,  for which we earn a service fee.\n\n## Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\n\nOur  contracts  with  customers  may  include  multiple  performance  obligations.  For  such  arrangements,  we  allocate revenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus margin.\n\n## Customer Incentives and Credits\n\nCertain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration.\n\n## Sales Commissions\n\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred and when the amortization period (the period of the expected benefit) is one year or less. We recognize an asset for certain sales commissions if we expect the period of benefit of these costs to exceed one year and recognize the expense over the amortization period. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.\n\n## Cost of Revenues\n\nCost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n\n- TAC includes:\n- Amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution  partners  include  browser  providers,  mobile  carriers,  original  equipment  manufacturers,  and software developers.\n- Amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n- Other cost of revenues includes:\n- Content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee).",

While we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings.\n\n## \u00b7 The portion of revenues that we derive from non-advertising revenues is increasing and may adversely affect margins.\n\nNon-advertising revenues have grown over time. We expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our offerings through products and services like Google Cloud, Google Play, hardware products, and YouTube subscriptions. We currently derive non-advertising revenues primarily from sales of apps and in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud services and subscription and other services. A number of Other Bets initiatives are in their initial development stages, and as such, revenues from these businesses could be volatile.  In  addition,  the  margins  on  these  revenues  vary  significantly  and  may  be  lower  than  the margins on our advertising revenues.\n\n## \u00b7 As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and capital expenditures.\n\nWe continue to make significant R&amp;D investments in areas of strategic focus across Google Services, Google Cloud and Other Bets. We also expect to continue to invest in land and buildings for data centers and offices, and information technology assets, which includes servers and network equipment, to support the long-term growth of our business. In addition, acquisitions and strategic investments contribute to the breadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in  engineering  and  other  functional  areas,  and  build  strong  partnerships  around  strategic  initiatives.  For  example,  in January 2021 we closed the acquisition of Fitbit, Inc. for $2.1 billion, which is expected to help spur innovation in wearable devices.\n\n## \u00b7 We face continuing changes in regulatory conditions, laws, and public policies, which could affect our business practices and financial results.\n\nChanges in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range of topics and related legal matters have resulted in fines and caused us to change our business practices. As these global trends continue, our cost of doing business may increase, and our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products or services may be limited. Examples include the antitrust complaints filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and a  number  of  state Attorneys  General,  the  Digital  Markets Act  in  Europe,  and  various  legislative  proposals  in  the  U.S. focused on large technology platforms.\n\n## \u00b7 Our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them.\n\nOur employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. We expect to continue hiring talented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs. For additional information see Culture and Workforce in Part I, Item 1 'Business.'\n\n## Seasonality and other\n\nOur  advertising  revenues  are  affected  by  seasonal  fluctuations  in  internet  usage,  advertising  expenditures,  and underlying  business  trends,  such  as  traditional  retail  seasonality.  Additionally,  our  non-advertising  revenues,  including those  generated  from  Google  Cloud,  Google  Play,  hardware,  and  YouTube,  may  be  affected  by  fluctuations  driven  by changes in pricing, digital content releases, fee structures, new product and service launches, other market dynamics, as well as seasonality.\n\n## Revenues and Monetization Metrics\n\n## Google Services\n\nGoogle Services revenues consist of revenues generated from advertising ('Google advertising') as well as revenues from other sources ('Google other revenues').\n\n## Google Advertising\n\nGoogle advertising revenues are comprised of the following:\n\n- Google Search &amp; other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n- YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and",

      "answer": "The increase in TAC paid to Google Network partners, driven by changes in device mix, geographic mix, and partner mix, directly affects the gross advertising revenue recognition model by increasing the cost of revenues associated with ads placed on Google Network properties. Since Google reports advertising revenues from these properties on a gross basis\u2014recording the full amount billed to customers as revenue and the amounts paid to partners as cost of revenues\u2014an increase in TAC results in higher cost of revenues. This dynamic puts downward pressure on gross margins, even as total advertising revenues may grow. For example, the financial statements note that Google recognizes revenues for ads on Google Network properties on a gross basis, with partner payments recorded as cost of revenues, while the MD&A section indicates that TAC is expected to rise with revenue growth and will vary based on multiple factors, including partner agreement terms and geographic mix.",

        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - 'Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed on Google Network properties on a gross basis... amounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of revenues,' showing that increases in TAC directly increase cost of revenues.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - As TAC increases due to the factors outlined in the MD&A, and since these payments are recorded as cost of revenues under the gross revenue recognition model, the result is margin pressure despite potential revenue growth."

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nPlease read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with 'Note about Forward-Looking Statements,' Part I, Item 1 \"Business,\" Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors,\" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nWe have omitted discussion of 2019 results where it would be redundant to the discussion previously included in Item 7 of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Understanding Alphabet's Financial Results\n\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses - the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google Services  and  Google  Cloud;  we  also  report  all  non-Google  businesses  collectively  as  Other  Bets.  Other  Bets  include earlier stage technologies that are further afield from our core Google business. For further details on our segments, see Part I, Item 1 'Business' and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect\n\nThe following long-term trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate that they will continue to affect our future results:\n\n- Users' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves.\n\nThe continuing shift  from  an  offline  to  online  world  has  contributed  to  the  growth  of  our  business  since  inception, contributing to revenue growth, and we expect that this online shift will continue to benefit our business.\n\n- Users are increasingly using diverse devices and modalities to access our products and services, and our advertising revenues are increasingly coming from new formats.\n\nOur users are accessing the Internet via diverse devices and modalities, such as smartphones, wearables and smart home devices, and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or what they are doing. We are focused on expanding our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and grow our business.\n\nWe are increasingly generating advertising revenues from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising formats. The margins on advertising revenues from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those  from  traditional  desktop  search. Additionally,  as  the  market  for  a  particular  device  type  or  modality  matures,  our revenues  may  be  affected.  For  example,  growth  in  the  global  smartphone  market  has  slowed  due  to  various  factors, including  increased  market  saturation  in  developed  countries,  which  can  affect  our  mobile  advertising  revenue  growth rates.\n\nWe expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow and TAC as a percentage of our advertising revenues (\"TAC rate\") to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic mix; partner mix; partner agreement terms; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product mix; the relative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels; and revenue share terms.\n\nWe expect these trends to continue to affect our revenue growth rates and put pressure on our margins.\n\n- As  online  advertising  evolves,  we  continue  to  expand  our  product  offerings,  which  may  affect  our monetization.\n\nAs interactions between users and advertisers change, and as online user behavior evolves, we continue to expand and evolve our product offerings to serve these changing needs. Over time, we expect our monetization trends to fluctuate. For example, we have seen an increase in revenues from ads on YouTube and Google Play, which monetize at a lower rate than our traditional search ads.\n\n- As  users  in  developing  economies  increasingly  come  online,  our  revenues  from  international  markets continue to increase and movements in foreign exchange rates affect such revenues.\n\nThe shift  to  online,  as  well  as  the  advent  of  the  multi-device  world,  has  brought  opportunities  outside  of  the  U.S., including in emerging markets, such as India. We continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our products and  advertising  programs  relevant  to  our  users  in  these  markets.  This  has  led  to  a  trend  of  increased  revenues  from emerging markets. We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these markets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. This trend could affect our revenues as developing markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Alphabet Inc.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\n\n## Basis of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nPreparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  GAAP  requires  us  to  make  estimates  and assumptions  that  affect  the  amounts  reported  and  disclosed  in  the  financial  statements  and  the  accompanying  notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties, including the effects of COVID-19. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; fair values of financial instruments, intangible assets, and goodwill; useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment; income taxes; and contingent liabilities, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\n\nIn  January  2021,  we  completed  an  assessment  of  the  useful  lives  of  our  servers  and  network  equipment  and adjusted the estimated useful life  of  our  servers  from  three  years  to  four  years  and  the  estimated  useful  life  of  certain network equipment from three years to five years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal year 2021. Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 2020 and those acquired during the year ended December 31, 2021, the effect of this change in estimate was a reduction in depreciation expense of $2.6 billion and an increase in net income of $2.0 billion, or $3.02 per basic share and $2.98 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, and the collectibility  of  an  amount  that  we  expect  in  exchange  for  those  goods  or  services  is  probable.  Sales  and  other  similar taxes are excluded from revenues.\n\n## Advertising Revenues\n\nWe generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on:\n\n- Google Search and other properties, including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use  Google.com  as  their  default  search  in  browsers,  toolbars,  etc.  and  other  Google  owned  and  operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n- YouTube properties; and\n- Google Network properties, including revenues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\n\nOur  customers  generally  purchase  advertising  inventory  through  Google  Ads,  Google  Ad  Manager,  and  Google Marketing Platform, among others.\n\nWe offer advertising by delivering both performance and brand advertising. We recognize revenues for performance advertising when a user engages with the advertisement, such as a click, a view, or a purchase. For brand advertising, we recognize revenues when the ad is displayed, or a user views the ad.\n\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed on Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues, and amounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing.",

      "answer": "In Q4 2023, violating accounts were estimated to constitute approximately 3% of Meta's worldwide MAP, while false accounts were estimated to represent approximately 4% of Meta's worldwide MAUs. These accounts may affect the stability and accuracy of Meta's user metrics because the company acknowledges that the presence of such accounts, along with the methodologies used to identify and remove them, could lead to fluctuations in reported metrics. Additionally, limitations in data signals (e.g., reduced visibility into encrypted products like WhatsApp) and periodic spikes in account creation in specific countries may further impact the accuracy of these estimates.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Meta estimated that 3% of its worldwide MAP consisted solely of violating accounts in Q4 2023.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Meta estimated that false accounts represented approximately 4% of its worldwide MAUs in Q4 2023.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both violating and false accounts are difficult to measure accurately due to limitations in data signals and evolving methodologies. Meta explicitly states that these accounts and the methods used to detect them may affect the stability and accuracy of its user metrics."

This estimation process reflects challenges in identifying such accounts across encrypted platforms like WhatsApp due to limited visibility and reliance on fewer data signals such as phone numbers and device information, which increases the difficulty of accurate detection at scale.",

      "question": "How do technical errors and data limitations in Meta's Family metrics estimation process affect the accuracy of its monthly active people (MAP) and average revenue per person (ARPP) metrics, and by what approximate margin could these metrics vary due to such inaccuracies?",
      "answer": "Meta acknowledges that its Family metrics, including monthly active people (MAP) and average revenue per person (ARPP), are based on internal data and are inherently subject to statistical variances, uncertainties, and technical errors in their estimation process. The company uses complex algorithms, machine learning models, and user survey data calibrated against signals like IP addresses and device information to estimate the number of unique individuals using its platforms. These models require significant judgment and are affected by data limitations. Meta estimates that the potential error margin for its Family metrics is generally around 3% of its worldwide MAP. Given that Meta reported approximately 3.3 billion worldwide MAP in 2023, this 3% error margin implies that the actual number of unique users could vary by about 99 million. This level of inaccuracy can significantly affect the reliability of ARPP calculations, which depend on MAP for per-user revenue averaging, and could distort business decisions, investor perceptions, and advertising investments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Meta uses internal data and complex models to estimate Family metrics (DAP, MAP, ARPP), which are susceptible to algorithm or technical errors and data limitations.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Meta estimates that the error margin for Family metrics is approximately 3% of worldwide MAP, and it acknowledges that duplicate and false accounts further complicate metric accuracy.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The 3% error margin on MAP (approximately 99 million people based on 3.3 billion MAP) affects ARPP calculations, as ARPP is derived by dividing total revenue by DAP or MAP. Technical errors and data limitations therefore propagate into both user engagement and revenue metrics."

The increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership resulted from our price changes and favorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Paid net membership additions for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased 50% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Our service continues to grow globally, with over 90% of the paid net membership additions for the year ended December 31, 2021 coming from outside the United States and Canada (UCAN) region.\n\nThe increase in operating margin is due primarily to content amortization growing at a slower rate as compared to the 19% increase in revenues in part as a result of delays in content releases due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict. See Item 1A: \"Risk Factors\" section set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details. While most of our productions have resumed, certain of our productions continue to experience disruption, as do the productions of our third-party content suppliers. Other partners have similarly had their operations disrupted, including those partners that we use for our operations as well as development, production and post-production of content. Production disruptions and new health and safety protocols and requirements can result in additional costs including additional pay to cast and crew and use of PPE and testing. We will continue to actively monitor the issues raised by the COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state, local or foreign authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and stockholders.  It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our members, suppliers or vendors, or on our financial results.\n\n## Streaming Revenues\n\nWe derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members.

In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business\n\n## If our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.\n\nWe have experienced significant membership growth over the past several years. Our penetration and growth rates vary between the jurisdictions where we provide our service. In countries where we have been operating for many years or where we are highly penetrated, our membership growth is slower than in newer or less penetrated countries. Our ability to continue to attract and retain members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members in countries around the globe with compelling content choices, effectively drive conversation around our content and service, as well as provide a quality experience for choosing and enjoying TV series, documentaries, feature films and mobile games. Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain memberships. Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as MVPDs, and streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers, as well as user-generated content, and more broadly other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time.\n\nIf consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existing features, adjust pricing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain members. We have recently expanded our entertainment video offering to include games. If our efforts to develop and offer games are not valued by our current and future members, our ability to attract and retain members may be negatively impacted. We may, from time to time, adjust our membership pricing, our membership plans, or our pricing model itself, which may not be wellreceived by consumers, and which may result in existing members canceling our service or fewer new members joining our service. In addition, many of our members rejoin our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts to satisfy our existing members are not successful, we may not be able to attract members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be adversely affected. Members cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, the need to cut household expenses, availability of content is unsatisfactory, competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved. Membership growth is also impacted by seasonality, with the fourth quarter historically representing our greatest growth, as well as the timing of our content release schedules. We must continually add new memberships both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. While we currently permit multiple users within the same household to share a single account for non-commercial purposes, if multi-household usage is abused or if our efforts to restrict multi-household usage are ineffective, our ability to add new members may be hindered and our results of operations may be adversely impacted. If we do not grow as expected, given, in particular, that our content costs are largely fixed in nature and contracted over several years, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our (per membership) revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operation may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in providing compelling content, retaining our existing memberships and attracting new memberships, our business will be adversely affected.\n\n## Changes in competitive offerings for entertainment video could adversely impact our business.\n\nThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. Piracy, in particular, threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. Furthermore, in light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth. Traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their streaming video offerings. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content, large content libraries, and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may offer more compelling content or secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. If we are unable to successfully or profitably compete",

Despite this rise in amortization, the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue decreased from 61% to 58%, primarily due to delays in content releases caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which slowed the rate of amortization growth relative to revenue growth.",

Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Description of Business\n\nNetflix, Inc. (the 'Company') was incorporated on August 29, 1997 and began operations on April 14, 1998. The Company is one of the world's leading entertainment services with approximately 222 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries, feature films and mobile games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can engage as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials. Additionally, the Company continues to offer its DVD-by-mail service in the United States (\"U.S.\").\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the content asset amortization policy and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates these assumptions, judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n## Recently adopted accounting pronouncements\n\nIn December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') issued Accounting Standards Update ('ASU') 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (Topic 740) . ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions for performing intraperiod tax allocations, recognizing deferred taxes for investments, and calculating income taxes in interim periods. The guidance also simplifies the accounting for franchise taxes, transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill, and the effect of enacted changes in tax laws or rates in interim periods. The Company adopted ASU 2019-12 in the first quarter of 2021 and the adoption had no material impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\n\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers , which requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606. ASU 2021-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 and early adoption is permitted. While the Company is continuing to assess the timing of adoption and the potential impacts of ASU 2021-08, it does not expect ASU 2021-08 to have a material effect, if any, on its consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Cash Equivalents\n\nThe Company considers investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. The Company also classifies amounts in transit from payment processors for customer credit card and debit card transactions as cash equivalents.\n\n## Content\n\nThe Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming, in order to offer members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within \"Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.",

In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business\n\n## If our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.\n\nWe have experienced significant membership growth over the past several years. Our penetration and growth rates vary between the jurisdictions where we provide our service. In countries where we have been operating for many years or where we are highly penetrated, our membership growth is slower than in newer or less penetrated countries. Our ability to continue to attract and retain members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members in countries around the globe with compelling content choices, effectively drive conversation around our content and service, as well as provide a quality experience for choosing and enjoying TV series, documentaries, feature films and mobile games. Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain memberships. Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as MVPDs, and streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers, as well as user-generated content, and more broadly other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time.\n\nIf consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existing features, adjust pricing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain members. We have recently expanded our entertainment video offering to include games. If our efforts to develop and offer games are not valued by our current and future members, our ability to attract and retain members may be negatively impacted. We may, from time to time, adjust our membership pricing, our membership plans, or our pricing model itself, which may not be wellreceived by consumers, and which may result in existing members canceling our service or fewer new members joining our service. In addition, many of our members rejoin our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts to satisfy our existing members are not successful, we may not be able to attract members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be adversely affected. Members cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, the need to cut household expenses, availability of content is unsatisfactory, competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved. Membership growth is also impacted by seasonality, with the fourth quarter historically representing our greatest growth, as well as the timing of our content release schedules. We must continually add new memberships both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. While we currently permit multiple users within the same household to share a single account for non-commercial purposes, if multi-household usage is abused or if our efforts to restrict multi-household usage are ineffective, our ability to add new members may be hindered and our results of operations may be adversely impacted. If we do not grow as expected, given, in particular, that our content costs are largely fixed in nature and contracted over several years, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our (per membership) revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operation may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in providing compelling content, retaining our existing memberships and attracting new memberships, our business will be adversely affected.\n\n## Changes in competitive offerings for entertainment video could adversely impact our business.\n\nThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. Piracy, in particular, threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. Furthermore, in light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth. Traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their streaming video offerings. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content, large content libraries, and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may offer more compelling content or secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. If we are unable to successfully or profitably compete",

The increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership resulted from our price changes and favorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Paid net membership additions for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased 50% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Our service continues to grow globally, with over 90% of the paid net membership additions for the year ended December 31, 2021 coming from outside the United States and Canada (UCAN) region.\n\nThe increase in operating margin is due primarily to content amortization growing at a slower rate as compared to the 19% increase in revenues in part as a result of delays in content releases due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict.

The Company has entered into payfloating interest rate and cross-currency swaps that effectively convert the borrowings to a variable-rate U.S. dollar denominated borrowings indexed to SOFR.\n\n## Cruise Ship Credit Facilities\n\nAt September 28, 2024, the Company had two credit facilities to finance, at its option, a significant portion of the contract price of two new cruise ships. With the delivery of the Disney Treasure , which occurred in October 2024, the Company borrowed $1.1 billion under one credit facility with a fixed interest rate of 3.80% in November 2024 that will be payable semi-annually over 12 years. The remaining credit facility for $1.1 billion may be utilized to finance a significant portion of the contract price of the Disney Destiny , which is currently scheduled to be delivered in fiscal 2026. If utilized, the loan will have a fix ed interest rate of 3.74% and will be payable semi-annually over 12 years. Early repayment of both facilities is permitted subject to cancellation fees.\n\n## Asia Theme Parks Borrowings\n\nHKSAR provided Hong Kong Disneyland Resort with loans totaling HK $0.5 billion ($68 million). The interest rate is three month HIBOR plus 2% and the maturity date is September 2025.\n\nShendi has provided Shanghai Disney Resort with loans totaling 8.6 billion yuan (approximately $1.2 billion) bearing interest at 8% and is scheduled to mature in 2036 with earlier payments required based on available cash flows. In addition, early repayment is permitted. Shendi has also provided Shanghai Disney Resort with a 2.6 billion yuan (approx imately $0.4 billion) line of credit bearing interest at 8%.

The remaining credit facility for $1.1 billion may be utilized to finance a significant portion of the contract price of the Disney Destiny , which is currently scheduled to be delivered in fiscal 2026. If utilized, the loan will have a fix ed interest rate of 3.74% and will be payable semi-annually over 12 years. Early repayment of both facilities is permitted subject to cancellation fees.\n\n## Asia Theme Parks Borrowings\n\nHKSAR provided Hong Kong Disneyland Resort with loans totaling HK $0.5 billion ($68 million).

The accounting guidance requires nonmarketable equity securities to be recorded at cost and adjusted to fair value at each reporting period. However, the guidance allows for a measurement alternative, which is to record the investments at cost, less impairment, if any, and subsequently adjust for observable price changes of identical or similar investments of the same issuer.  We generally apply the measurement alternative, adjusting the investments for observable price changes of identical or similar investments of the same issuer, to our nonmarketable equity securities. When an observable event occurs, we estimate the fair values of our nonmarketable equity securities primarily based on Level 2 inputs that are derived from observable price changes of similar securities adjusted for insignificant differences in rights and obligations. The changes in value are recorded in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net.\n\n## Other Investments\n\nOther investments also includes certain short-term instruments with maturities over three months when purchased, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit and U.S. government obligations, that are generally accounted for at amortized cost. We had no short-term instruments as of December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, these short-term instruments totaled $254 million. The carrying amounts of these investments approximate their fair values, which are primarily based on Level 2 inputs  that  use  interest  rates  for  instruments  with  similar  terms  and  remaining  maturities.  Proceeds  from  short-term  instruments  in  2024,  2023  and 2022  were $702 million, $560 million and $1.6 billion, respectively. Purchases of short-term instruments in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $443 million, $506 million and $1.8 billion, respectively.\n\n## Impairment Testing of Investments\n\nWe  review  our  investment  portfolio,  other  than  our  marketable  equity  securities,  each  reporting  period  to  determine  whether  there  are  identified  events  or circumstances that would indicate there is a decline in the fair value. For our nonpublic investments, if there are no identified events or circumstances that would have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment, then the fair value is not estimated. For our equity method investments, if an investment is deemed to have experienced an other-than-temporary decline below its cost basis, we reduce the carrying amount of the investment to its quoted or estimated fair value, as applicable, and establish a new cost basis for the investment. For our nonmarketable equity securities, we record the impairment to realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. For our equity method investments, we record the impairment to other income (loss), net.\n\n## Consolidated Variable Interest Entity\n\n## Universal Beijing Resort\n\nIn 2018, we entered into an agreement with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies to build and operate a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China ('Universal  Beijing  Resort'), which opened in  September 2021.  We own a 30% interest in Universal Beijing Resort and the construction was funded through a combination of debt financing and equity contributions from the partners in accordance with their equity interests. The debt financing, which is being provided by a syndicate of Chinese financial institutions, contains certain covenants and a maximum borrowing limit of \u00a529.7 billion RMB (approximately $4.2 billion). The debt financing is secured by the assets of Universal Beijing Resort and the equity interests of the investors. As of December 31, 2024, Universal Beijing Resort had $3.4 billion of debt outstanding, including $3.0 billion principal amount of a term loan outstanding under the debt financing agreement. As of December 31, 2023, Universal Beijing Resort had $3.5 billion of debt outstanding, including $3.1 billion principal amount of a term loan outstanding under the debt financing agreement.\n\nWe have concluded that Universal Beijing Resort is a VIE based on its governance structure, and we consolidate it because we have the power to direct activities that most significantly impact its economic performance. There are no liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other financial commitments between us and Universal Beijing Resort, and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss is our 30% interest. Universal Beijing Resort's results of operations are reported in our Theme Parks segment. Our consolidated statements of cash flows includes the costs of construction and related borrowings in the 'construction of Universal Beijing Resort' and 'proceeds from borrowings' captions, respectively, and equity contributions from the noncontrolling interests are included in other financing activities.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, our consolidated balance sheets included assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort totaling $7.3 billion and $7.0 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, our consolidated balance sheets included assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort totaling $7.8 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively.

      "answer": "Comcast owns a 30% interest in Universal Beijing Resort, which it consolidates due to its determination that Universal Beijing Resort is a VIE and Comcast has the power to direct its major activities. As of December 31, 2024, Universal Beijing Resort had $7.3 billion in assets and $7.0 billion in liabilities, which are fully included in Comcast\u2019s consolidated balance sheet. Universal Beijing Resort had $3.4 billion in debt outstanding, and Comcast\u2019s maximum risk of financial loss is limited to its 30% equity interest, which equates to 30% of the total debt, or $1.02 billion.",

The  related  translation  adjustments  are  recorded  as  a  component  of accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheets.  Any  foreign  currency  transaction  gains  or  losses  are  included  in  our consolidated statements of income in investment and other income (loss), net. For disclosures containing future amounts where the functional currency is the local currency, we translate the amounts into U.S. dollars at the ex change rates as of the balance sheet date.\n\nIn November 2024, we announced our intention to create SpinCo, a new independent publicly traded company comprised of select domestic cable television networks along with complementary digital assets through a tax-free spin-off. We are targeting to complete the Spin-off by the end of 2025, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including obtaining final approval from our Board of Directors, satisfactory completion of SpinCo financings, receipt of tax opinions and receipt of any regulatory approvals. There can be no assurance that a separation transaction will occur, or, if one does, of its terms or timing. The consolidated financial statements and related notes do not reflect the proposed Spin-off.\n\n## Reclassifications\n\nOur current liability for accrued participations and residuals is separately disclosed in Note 4 in the current year and is included within the 'accrued expenses and other current liabilities' caption in our consolidated balance sheet for all periods presented. Previously these amounts were presented in a separate caption in our consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Accounting Policies\n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require us to select accounting policies, including in certain cases industryspecific policies, and make estimates that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and ex penses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The following accounting policies are specific to the industries in which we operate:\n\n- capitalization and amortization of film and television costs (see Note 4)\n- costs for connecting customers to our HFC network (see Note 8)\n\nInformation on other accounting policies and methods that we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are included, where applicable, in their respective footnotes that follow. Below is a discussion of accounting policies and methods used in our consolidated financial statements that are not presented within other footnotes.\n\n## Advertising Expenses\n\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nThe accounting guidance related to fair value measurements establishes a hierarchy based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques. The levels of the hierarchy are described below.\n\n- Level 1: Values are determined using quoted market prices for identical financial instruments in an active market.\n- Level 2: V alues are determined using quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets.\n- Level 3: V alues are determined using models that use significant inputs that are primarily unobservable, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.\n\nWe use this three-tier fair value hierarchy to measure the fair value of certain financial instruments on a recurring basis, such as for investments (see Note 7); on a non-recurring basis, such as for acquisitions and impairment testing (see Note 9); and for disclosure purposes, such as for debt (see Note 6). Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation and classification within the fair value hierarchy.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\n## Nonmarketable Equity Securities\n\nWe classify  investments  without  readily  determinable  fair  values  that  are  not  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  as  nonmarketable  equity  securities.  The accounting guidance requires nonmarketable equity securities to be recorded at cost and adjusted to fair value at each reporting period. However, the guidance allows for a measurement alternative, which is to record the investments at cost, less impairment, if any, and subsequently adjust for observable price changes of identical or similar investments of the same issuer.  We generally apply the measurement alternative, adjusting the investments for observable price changes of identical or similar investments of the same issuer, to our nonmarketable equity securities. When an observable event occurs, we estimate the fair values of our nonmarketable equity securities primarily based on Level 2 inputs that are derived from observable price changes of similar securities adjusted for insignificant differences in rights and obligations. The changes in value are recorded in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net.\n\n## Other Investments\n\nOther investments also includes certain short-term instruments with maturities over three months when purchased, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit and U.S. government obligations, that are generally accounted for at amortized cost. We had no short-term instruments as of December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, these short-term instruments totaled $254 million. The carrying amounts of these investments approximate their fair values, which are primarily based on Level 2 inputs  that  use  interest  rates  for  instruments  with  similar  terms  and  remaining  maturities.  Proceeds  from  short-term  instruments  in  2024,  2023  and 2022  were $702 million, $560 million and $1.6 billion, respectively. Purchases of short-term instruments in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $443 million, $506 million and $1.8 billion, respectively.\n\n## Impairment Testing of Investments\n\nWe  review  our  investment  portfolio,  other  than  our  marketable  equity  securities,  each  reporting  period  to  determine  whether  there  are  identified  events  or circumstances that would indicate there is a decline in the fair value. For our nonpublic investments, if there are no identified events or circumstances that would have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment, then the fair value is not estimated. For our equity method investments, if an investment is deemed to have experienced an other-than-temporary decline below its cost basis, we reduce the carrying amount of the investment to its quoted or estimated fair value, as applicable, and establish a new cost basis for the investment. For our nonmarketable equity securities, we record the impairment to realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. For our equity method investments, we record the impairment to other income (loss), net.\n\n## Consolidated Variable Interest Entity\n\n## Universal Beijing Resort\n\nIn 2018, we entered into an agreement with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies to build and operate a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China ('Universal  Beijing  Resort'), which opened in  September 2021.  We own a 30% interest in Universal Beijing Resort and the construction was funded through a combination of debt financing and equity contributions from the partners in accordance with their equity interests. The debt financing, which is being provided by a syndicate of Chinese financial institutions, contains certain covenants and a maximum borrowing limit of \u00a529.7 billion RMB (approximately $4.2 billion). The debt financing is secured by the assets of Universal Beijing Resort and the equity interests of the investors. As of December 31, 2024, Universal Beijing Resort had $3.4 billion of debt outstanding, including $3.0 billion principal amount of a term loan outstanding under the debt financing agreement. As of December 31, 2023, Universal Beijing Resort had $3.5 billion of debt outstanding, including $3.1 billion principal amount of a term loan outstanding under the debt financing agreement.\n\nWe have concluded that Universal Beijing Resort is a VIE based on its governance structure, and we consolidate it because we have the power to direct activities that most significantly impact its economic performance. There are no liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other financial commitments between us and Universal Beijing Resort, and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss is our 30% interest. Universal Beijing Resort's results of operations are reported in our Theme Parks segment. Our consolidated statements of cash flows includes the costs of construction and related borrowings in the 'construction of Universal Beijing Resort' and 'proceeds from borrowings' captions, respectively, and equity contributions from the noncontrolling interests are included in other financing activities.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, our consolidated balance sheets included assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort totaling $7.3 billion and $7.0 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, our consolidated balance sheets included assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort totaling $7.8 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively. The assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort primarily consist of property and equipment, operating lease assets and liabilities, and debt.",

In 2024, it had $7.3 billion in assets and $7.0 billion in liabilities, resulting in net assets of -$0.3 billion. This represents a decrease in net assets of $0.9 billion.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\n## Nonmarketable Equity Securities\n\nWe classify  investments  without  readily  determinable  fair  values  that  are  not  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  as  nonmarketable  equity  securities.  The accounting guidance requires nonmarketable equity securities to be recorded at cost and adjusted to fair value at each reporting period. However, the guidance allows for a measurement alternative, which is to record the investments at cost, less impairment, if any, and subsequently adjust for observable price changes of identical or similar investments of the same issuer.  We generally apply the measurement alternative, adjusting the investments for observable price changes of identical or similar investments of the same issuer, to our nonmarketable equity securities. When an observable event occurs, we estimate the fair values of our nonmarketable equity securities primarily based on Level 2 inputs that are derived from observable price changes of similar securities adjusted for insignificant differences in rights and obligations. The changes in value are recorded in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net.\n\n## Other Investments\n\nOther investments also includes certain short-term instruments with maturities over three months when purchased, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit and U.S. government obligations, that are generally accounted for at amortized cost. We had no short-term instruments as of December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, these short-term instruments totaled $254 million. The carrying amounts of these investments approximate their fair values, which are primarily based on Level 2 inputs  that  use  interest  rates  for  instruments  with  similar  terms  and  remaining  maturities.  Proceeds  from  short-term  instruments  in  2024,  2023  and 2022  were $702 million, $560 million and $1.6 billion, respectively. Purchases of short-term instruments in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $443 million, $506 million and $1.8 billion, respectively.\n\n## Impairment Testing of Investments\n\nWe  review  our  investment  portfolio,  other  than  our  marketable  equity  securities,  each  reporting  period  to  determine  whether  there  are  identified  events  or circumstances that would indicate there is a decline in the fair value. For our nonpublic investments, if there are no identified events or circumstances that would have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment, then the fair value is not estimated. For our equity method investments, if an investment is deemed to have experienced an other-than-temporary decline below its cost basis, we reduce the carrying amount of the investment to its quoted or estimated fair value, as applicable, and establish a new cost basis for the investment. For our nonmarketable equity securities, we record the impairment to realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. For our equity method investments, we record the impairment to other income (loss), net.\n\n## Consolidated Variable Interest Entity\n\n## Universal Beijing Resort\n\nIn 2018, we entered into an agreement with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies to build and operate a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China ('Universal  Beijing  Resort'), which opened in  September 2021.  We own a 30% interest in Universal Beijing Resort and the construction was funded through a combination of debt financing and equity contributions from the partners in accordance with their equity interests. The debt financing, which is being provided by a syndicate of Chinese financial institutions, contains certain covenants and a maximum borrowing limit of \u00a529.7 billion RMB (approximately $4.2 billion). The debt financing is secured by the assets of Universal Beijing Resort and the equity interests of the investors. As of December 31, 2024, Universal Beijing Resort had $3.4 billion of debt outstanding, including $3.0 billion principal amount of a term loan outstanding under the debt financing agreement. As of December 31, 2023, Universal Beijing Resort had $3.5 billion of debt outstanding, including $3.1 billion principal amount of a term loan outstanding under the debt financing agreement.\n\nWe have concluded that Universal Beijing Resort is a VIE based on its governance structure, and we consolidate it because we have the power to direct activities that most significantly impact its economic performance. There are no liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other financial commitments between us and Universal Beijing Resort, and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss is our 30% interest. Universal Beijing Resort's results of operations are reported in our Theme Parks segment. Our consolidated statements of cash flows includes the costs of construction and related borrowings in the 'construction of Universal Beijing Resort' and 'proceeds from borrowings' captions, respectively, and equity contributions from the noncontrolling interests are included in other financing activities.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, our consolidated balance sheets included assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort totaling $7.3 billion and $7.0 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, our consolidated balance sheets included assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort totaling $7.8 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively. The assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort primarily consist of property and equipment, operating lease assets and liabilities, and debt.",

      "question": "Which businesses, in addition to WarnerMedia, were classified as discontinued operations by AT&T as part of its strategic shift, and what was the significance of this classification in relation to AT&T's broader restructuring efforts?",
      "answer": "In addition to WarnerMedia, AT&T classified Vrio, Xandr, and Playdemic as discontinued operations as part of its strategic shift. This classification was significant because it reflected AT&T\u2019s comprehensive restructuring plan that involved divesting multiple business units, even those that did not individually meet the materiality threshold for discontinued operations. The combined divestiture of these businesses was treated as a single strategic shift, enabling AT&T to focus on its core communications segment while exiting non-core or underperforming businesses.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, we identify that AT&T classified WarnerMedia, Vrio, Xandr, and Playdemic as discontinued operations.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, we learn that the WarnerMedia business met the criteria for discontinued operations following its combination with Discovery, and that AT&T evaluated other components of its strategic shift, including dispositions that did not individually meet the materiality threshold.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The inclusion of Vrio, Xandr, and Playdemic alongside WarnerMedia in the discontinued operations classification indicates that AT&T pursued a coordinated exit strategy from multiple non-core businesses as part of its broader restructuring."

      "answer": "AT&T's collaboration with Ericsson for commercial-scale Open RAN deployment will pressure 2024 expense trends due to the spending required to support growth and efficiency initiatives, including the deployment of Open RAN and associated accelerated depreciation. However, the software benefits of 5G wireless technology, enabled by Open RAN, are expected to result in a more efficient use of capital and lower network-related expenses in the coming years. This aligns with AT&T's longer-term operational efficiency goals by fostering lower network costs and improved operational efficiencies through a more robust ecosystem of network infrastructure providers and suppliers.",

At the same time, Theme Parks capital expenditures rose due to development spending on Epic Universe in Orlando. Both areas saw increased investment, reflecting CMCSA's strategic focus on advancing major theme park attractions like Epic Universe while also expanding its core connectivity and infrastructure capabilities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, extract that CMCSA's Connectivity & Platforms capital expenditures rose 1.5% to $8.2 billion, driven by spending on line extensions and scalable infrastructure.",

      "answer": "Universal Beijing Resort's $3.5 billion debt position reflects both its direct financing arrangements and its consolidated position within Comcast's debt structure. As stated in the evidence, Universal Beijing Resort secured its financing through a debt facility with a maximum borrowing limit of \u00a529.7 billion RMB (approximately $4.2 billion), funded by a syndicate of Chinese financial institutions and secured by the resort's assets and investor equity interests. As of December 31, 2023, the resort had $3.5 billion of debt outstanding under this arrangement, including $3.1 billion in term loans. Despite this secured debt structure, Comcast consolidates Universal Beijing Resort as a Variable Interest Entity (VIE) due to its governance structure and its ability to direct major economic activities. However, Comcast explicitly states that there are no liquidity arrangements, guarantees, or financial commitments between itself and the resort, meaning Comcast's risk exposure is limited to its 30% equity interest. In the consolidated debt disclosures, Universal Beijing Resort's $3.5 billion debt is categorized under 'Debt Not Guaranteed,' appearing separately from Comcast's other major debt segments like NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable, which are subject to cross-guarantees.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Universal Beijing Resort is a VIE consolidated by Comcast, with $3.5 billion of debt outstanding as of December 31, 2023, including $3.1 billion in term loans under a \u00a529.7 billion RMB ($4.2 billion) secured financing facility.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Universal Beijing Resort's $3.5 billion debt is classified under 'Debt Not Guaranteed' in Comcast's consolidated debt structure, separate from cross-guaranteed and one-way guaranteed debt segments.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Universal Beijing Resort\u2019s $3.5 billion debt appears in Comcast\u2019s consolidated structure as a VIE, but it is not guaranteed by Comcast, reflecting both its direct secured financing and its distinct position within the broader debt framework."

This indicates that a significant portion of Comcast\u2019s long-term programming liabilities is driven by its multiyear commitments to broadcast major sports leagues like the English Premier League.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - 'As of December 31, 2023, approximately 29% of cash payments related to our programming and production obligations are due after five years, of which the vast majority related to multiyear sports rights agreements.'",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - 'Our most significant sports rights commitments relate to the NFL, Olympics and English Premier League.'",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The 29% long-term obligation is primarily due to multiyear sports rights, and since the English Premier League is listed among the most significant of these commitments, it is a key contributor to this portion of the liability."

Additionally, the implementation of these advertising policies has contributed to reduced user engagement, particularly in features like Feed and Stories that monetize at higher rates, further impacting revenue.

If we are unable to maintain or increase our user base and user engagement, particularly for our significant revenue-generating products like Facebook and Instagram, our revenue and financial results may be adversely affected. Any significant decrease in user retention, growth, or engagement could render our products less attractive to users, marketers, and developers, which is likely to have a material and adverse impact on our ability to deliver ad impressions and, accordingly, our revenue, business, financial condition, and results of operations. As the size of our active user base fluctuates in one or more markets from time to time, we will become increasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase levels of user engagement and monetization in order to grow revenue.\n\n## We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. The loss of marketers, or reduction in spending by marketers, could seriously harm our business.\n\nSubstantially all of our revenue is currently generated from marketers advertising on Facebook and Instagram. As is common in the industry, our marketers do not  have  long-term  advertising  commitments  with  us.  Many  of  our  marketers  spend  only  a  relatively  small  portion  of  their  overall  advertising  budget  with  us. Marketers will not continue to do business with us, or they will reduce the budgets they are willing to commit to us, if we do not deliver ads in an effective manner, if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives, or if they are not satisfied for any other reason. We have implemented, and we will continue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively target ads, which has to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. If we are unable to provide marketers with a suitable return on investment, the demand for our ads may not increase, or may decline, in which case our revenue and financial results may be harmed.\n\nOur advertising revenue can also be adversely affected by a number of other factors, including:\n\n- decreases in user engagement, including time spent on our products;\n- our inability to continue to increase user access to and engagement with our products;\n- product changes or inventory management decisions we may make that change the size, format, frequency, or relative prominence of ads displayed on our products or of other unpaid content shared by marketers on our products;\n- our inability to maintain or increase marketer demand, the pricing of our ads, or both;\n- our inability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users;\n- changes to the content or application of third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising, including changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such as Apple and Google;\n- adverse litigation, government actions, or legislative, regulatory, or other legal developments relating to advertising, including developments that may impact certain advertisers' ability to advertise on our platform or our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising;\n- user behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we monetize at a higher rate, such as our Feed and Stories products, including as a result of increased usage of our Reels or other video or messaging products;\n- reductions of advertising due to our efforts to implement or enforce advertising policies that protect the security and integrity of our platform or that we believe are needed to comply with global content, security, or integrity obligations;",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nnumber of laws have been introduced limiting or prohibiting the provision of our services to younger users. We expect these and other developments will have further impact in the future. As a result, we have implemented, and we will continue to implement, whether voluntarily or otherwise, changes to our products and user data practices, which reduce our ability to effectively target and measure ads and may negatively impact our advertising revenue and user engagement. For example, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced our plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and Instagram in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and began offering users in the region a \"subscription for no ads\" alternative. We subsequently began offering users in the region who elect to continue using our services free-of-charge, supported by ads, an option to see less personalized ads, which are expected to be less relevant and effective than our premium ad offerings. We are engaging with regulators on our consent model. In addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and G oogle, have implemented product changes and/or announced future plans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021, Apple made certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and other iOS developers' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms.\n\nTo mitigate these developments, we are continually working to evolve our advertising systems to improve the performance of our ad products.  We are developing privacy enhancing technologies to deliver relevant ads and measurement capabilities while reducing the amount of personal information we process, including by relying more on anonymized or aggregated third-party data. In addition, we are developing tools that enable marketers to share their data into our systems, as well as ad products that generate more valuable signals within our apps. More broadly, we also continue to innovate our advertising tools to help marketers prepare campaigns and connect with consumers, including developing growing formats such as Reels ads and our business messaging ad products. Across all of these efforts, we are making significant investments in artificial intelligence (AI), including generative AI, to improve our delivery, targeting, and measurement capabilities. Further, we are focused on driving onsite conversions in our business messaging ad products by developing new features and scaling existing features.\n\nWe are also engaging with others across our industry to explore the possibility of new open standards for the private and secure processing of data for advertising purposes. We believe our ongoing improvements to ad targeting and measurement are continuing to drive improved results for advertisers. However, we expect  that  some  of  these  efforts  will  be  long-term  initiatives,  and  that  the  legislative,  regulatory  and  platform  developments  described  above  will  continue  to adversely impact our advertising revenue for the foreseeable future.\n\nIn addition, we maintain advertising policies to protect the security and integrity of our platform and comply with global content, security, and integrity obligations. Our ongoing efforts to enhance enforcement against ads and marketers which violate our advertising policies adversely affect our revenue, and we expect that the continued enhancement of such efforts will have an impact on our revenue in the future, which may be material.\n\n## Other Business and Macroeconomic Conditions\n\nOther global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical conditions also have had, and we believe will continue to have, an impact on our user growth and engagement and advertising revenue. In particular, we believe advertising budgets have been pressured from time to time by factors such as inflation, high  interest  rates,  and  related  market  uncertainty,  which  has  led  to  reduced  marketer  spending.  While  we  saw  improvement  in  business  and  macroeconomic conditions in recent periods, continued business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical uncertainty remains, which could impact our financial results in future periods.\n\nIn addition, competitive products and services have reduced some users' engagement with our products and services. We are investing in Reels and in AI initiatives across our products, including our AI-powered discovery engine to recommend relevant content, which we have already seen results in improved user engagement and monetization of our products. However, we continue to face competition from other products and services within certain demographics, in particular younger users. In addition, while Reels is growing in usage, it monetizes at a lower rate than our Feed and Stories products and we expect it will continue to monetize at a lower rate for the foreseeable future. We also have seen fluctuations and declines in the size of our active user base in one or more regions from time to time due to geopolitical conditions, which have adversely affected our user growth and engagement. These trends adversely affected advertising revenue in 2024, and we expect will continue to affect our advertising revenue in the foreseeable future.",

In addition, we have been and continue to be the subject of litigation and investigations related to the ways in which we collect and use information, including where advertisers are subject to additional regulation such as housing, employment, credit, and financial services. In addition, beginning in March 2018, we became subject to FTC, state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies. In July 2019, we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020 and, among other things, required us to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. The state attorneys general inquiries and litigation, and certain government inquiries in other  jurisdictions  remain  ongoing.  The  FTC  also  continues  to  monitor  us  and  our  compliance  with  the  modified  consent  order  and  initiated  an  administrative proceeding against us, which we are challenging at the agency and in federal court, that alleges deficient compliance and violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the COPPA Rule, and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and seeks changes to our business. If we are unsuccessful in our challenge to the FTC's action and the agency imposes its proposed order in its current form, we would be subject to significant limitations, including on our ability to launch new and modified products or use data of users under 18 years old. We also notify the IDPC, our lead European Union privacy regulator under the GDPR, and other regulators of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, issue similar notifications to European regulators under other laws (such as UK GDPR and Member State implementations of the ePrivacy Directive), and are subject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other regulators regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance. In addition, we are subject to inquiries and investigations by the European Commission regarding our compliance with various provisions of the DSA relating to the use of Facebook and Instagram, including matters related to elections, content reporting and appeals, third-party access to data, political content recommendations, potential deceptive advertising and disinformation, and minors and other vulnerable users. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to penalties, fines, and requirements to change our business practices as a result of such inquiries and investigations. In addition, in July 2024, we entered into a settlement to resolve a lawsuit by the state of Tex as in connection with the \"tag suggestions\" feature and other uses of facial recognition technology.\n\nWe are also subject to various litigation and formal and informal inquiries and investigations by competition authorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions, which relate to many aspects of our business, including with respect to users and advertisers. Such inquiries, investigations, and lawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media services, messaging services, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, beginning in 2019, we became the subject of antitrust inquiries and investigations by the FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice. Beginning in 2020, we became subject to a lawsuit by the FTC alleging that we violated antitrust laws, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and  WhatsApp in 2014.  The complaint seeks a permanent injunction against our company's alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. In addition, in November 2024, the European Commission issued a fine as a result of its finding that we tied Facebook Marketplace to Facebook and use data in a manner that infringes European Union competition rules. We are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and disclosure practices. For ex ample, beginning in September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and requests relating to allegations and the release of internal company documents by a former employee.\n\nOrders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to civil and criminal liability (including liability for our personnel) or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business (including changes to our products or user data practices), result in negative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business, and we have experienced some of these adverse effects to varying degrees from time to time.\n\nCompliance with our FTC consent order, the GDPR, U.S. state privacy laws, youth social media laws, the ePrivacy Directive, the DMA, the DSA, and other regulatory and legislative privacy requirements require significant operational resources and modifications to our business practices, and any compliance failures may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, and financial results.\n\nWe are engaged in ongoing privacy compliance and oversight efforts, including in connection with our modified consent order with the FTC, requirements of the GDPR, and other current and anticipated regulatory and legislative",

In particular, we are maintaining a comprehensive privacy program in connection with the FTC consent order that includes substantial management and board of directors oversight, stringent operational requirements and reporting obligations, prohibitions against making misrepresentations relating to user data, a process to regularly certify our compliance with the privacy program to the FTC, and regular assessments of our privacy program by an independent third-party assessor, which has been and will continue to be challenging and costly to maintain and enhance. These compliance and oversight efforts are increasing demand on our systems and resources, and require significant new and ongoing investments, including investments in compliance processes, personnel, and technical infrastructure. We continually reallocate resources internally to assist with these efforts, and this has had, and will continue to have, an adverse impact on our other business initiatives. In addition, these efforts require substantial modifications to our business practices and make some practices such as product and ads development more difficult, time-consuming, and costly. As a result, we believe our ability to develop and launch new features, products, and services in a timely manner has been and will continue to be adversely affected.  Further, our privacy compliance and oversight efforts have required, and we expect will continue to require, significant time and attention from our management and board of directors. The requirements of the FTC consent order and other privacy-related laws and regulations are complex and apply broadly to our business, and from time to time we notify relevant authorities of instances where we are not in full compliance with these requirements or otherwise discover privacy issues, and we expect to continue to do so as any such issues arise in the future. In addition, regulatory and legislative privacy requirements are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change and uncertain interpretation. For example, we are subject to restrictions and requirements under the DMA, including in areas such as the combination of data across services and product design, which will likely be subject to further interpretation and regulatory engagement.\n\nThe  FTC  initiated  an  administrative  proceeding  against  us  alleging,  among  other  things,  deficient  compliance  with  the  FTC  consent  order  and  seeking substantial modifications to the requirements of the consent order, including a prohibition on our use of minors' data for any commercial purposes, changes to the composition of our board of directors, and significant limitations on our ability to modify and launch new products. We are challenging the FTC's administrative proceeding. If the challenge is unsuccessful and the FTC is able to impose the proposed order in its current form, it would limit our ability to provide certain features and services, engage in certain business practices, require us to further increase the time, resources, and costs we spend on compliance and oversight efforts, and would adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\nIf we are unable to successfully implement and comply with the mandates of the FTC consent order (including any future modifications to the order), GDPR, U.S. state privacy laws, youth social media laws, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, DSA, or other regulatory or legislative requirements, or if any relevant authority believes that we are in violation of the consent order or other applicable requirements, we may be subject to regulatory or governmental investigations or lawsuits, which may result in significant monetary fines or damages (including for loss of control of data without other damage), judgments, penalties, or other remedies, and we may also be required to make additional changes to our business practices. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, and financial results.\n\nWe may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet or published using our products or as a result of claims related to our products, and legislation regulating content on our platform may require us to change our products or business practices and may adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\nWe have faced, currently face, and will continue to face claims and government and regulatory inquiries relating to information or content that is published or made available on our products, including claims, inquiries, and investigations relating to our policies, algorithms, and enforcement decisions with respect to such information  or  content.  In  particular,  the  nature  of  our  business  ex poses  us  to  claims  related  to  defamation,  dissemination  of  misinformation  or  news  hoax es, deceptive and fraudulent advertising, discrimination, harassment, intellectual property rights, rights of publicity and privacy, personal injury torts, laws regulating hate speech or other types of content, on- or offline safety and well-being (such as acts of violence, terrorism, improper promotion or distribution of pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs, human exploitation, child ex ploitation, illegal gaming, and other fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity), products liability, consumer protection, and breach of contract, among others. For example, over the last several years we have seen an increase in claims brought by younger users related to well-being issues based on allegedly harmful content that is shared on or recommended by our products. In addition, we have been subject to litigation alleging that our ad targeting and delivery practices constitute violations of anti-discrimination laws.\n\nThe potential  risks  relating  to  any  of  the  foregoing  types  of  claims  are  currently  enhanced  in  certain  jurisdictions  outside  the  United  States  where  our protection from liability for third-party actions may be unclear or where we may be less",

Land  and  assets  held  within construction in progress (CIP) are not depreciated. CIP assets are related to the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for their intended use. We also capitalize interest on our debt related to certain eligible CIP assets and depreciate over the useful life of the related assets.\n\nThe cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from their respective accounts, and gain or loss on such sale or disposal is reflected in income from operations.\n\n## Lease Obligations\n\nOur operating leases mostly comprise of certain data centers, offices, and colocations. We also have finance leases for certain network infrastructure. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception and most of our leases contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components include fixed payments for maintenance, utilities, real estate tax es, and management fees. We combine fixed lease and non-lease components and account for them as a single lease component. Our lease agreements may contain variable costs such as contingent rent escalations, common area maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes, or other costs. These amounts are affected by the Consumer Price Index, payments contingent on energy production for renewable energy purchase arrangements, and maintenance and utilities.  Such variable lease costs are ex pensed as incurred on our consolidated statements of income. For certain colocation and equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities.\n\nFor leases with a lease term greater than 12 months, ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized on our consolidated balance sheets at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining fixed lease payments and includes only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement.\n\nOur lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. When determining the probability  of  ex ercising  such  options,  we  consider  contract-based,  asset-based,  entity-based,  and  market-based  factors.  We  do  not  assume  renewals  in  our determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured. Our lease agreements generally do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\n\nAs most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our incremental borrowing rate is based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be in a similar economic environment.\n\nOperating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current, and operating lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nOperating lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Finance lease assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease terms.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded net impairment losses of $383 million, $2.43 billion, and $2.22 billion, respectively, in aggregate for operating lease ROU assets and leasehold improvements under ASC Topic 360 as a part of our facilities consolidation restructuring efforts. The fair values of the impaired assets were estimated using discounted cash flow models (income approach) based on market participant assumptions with Level 3 inputs. The assumptions used in estimating fair value include the expected downtime prior to the commencement of future subleases, projected sublease income over the remaining  lease  periods,  and  discount  rates  that  reflect  the  level  of  risk  associated  with  receiving  future  cash  flows.  For  additional  information  regarding  our restructuring efforts, see Note 3 - Restructuring.",

The financing obligation is increased by interest expense and estimated future net cash flows generated and retained by Crown Castle from operation of the tower sites, and reduced by our contractual payments. We continue to include the tower assets in 'Property, Plant and Equipment - Net' on our consolidated balance sheets and depreciate them accordingly. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the tower assets had a balance of $725 and $764, respectively. Our depreciation expense for these assets was $39 for each of 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nPayments made to Crown Castle under this arrangement were $253 for 2021. At December 31, 2021, the future minimum payments under the sublease arrangement are $258 for 2022, $264 for 2023, $269 for 2024, $274 for 2025, $280 for 2026 and $707 thereafter.\n\n## NOTE 20. TRANSACTIONS WITH DIRECTV\n\nOn July 31, 2021, we closed our transaction with TPG to form a new company named DIRECTV (see Note 6). The transaction resulted in our deconsolidation of the Video business. Effective August 1, 2021, we began accounting for our investment in DIRECTV under the equity method and recorded our share of DIRECTV earnings as equity in net income of affiliates, with DIRECTV considered a related party (see Note 10).\n\nFor the five months ended December 31, 2021, our share of DIRECTV's earnings included in equity in net income of affiliates was $619. Cash distributions from DIRECTV totaled $1,942, with $619 classified as operating activities and $1,323 classified as investing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\nIn addition to the assets and liabilities contributed to DIRECTV, we recorded total obligations of approximately $2,100 to cover certain net losses under the NFL SUNDAY TICKET contract, of which $1,800 is in the form of a note payable to DIRECTV (see Note 6). Cash payments to DIRECTV on the note totaled $459 and were classified as financing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows. Amounts due under the DIRECTV note were $1,341 at December 31, 2021.\n\nThrough our WarnerMedia properties, we license content and programming and provide advertising services to DIRECTV. Revenue recognized from DIRECTV, which was previously eliminated, totaled approximately $670 for the five months ended December 31, 2021. We also provide DIRECTV with network transport for U-verse products and sales services under commercial arrangements for up to five years.\n\nPursuant to a commercial agreement, WarnerMedia continues to sell DIRECTV's advertising inventory under a revenue sharing agreement. WarnerMedia records amounts billed as advertising revenue and recognizes expense for DIRECTV's revenue share, which was approximately $600 for the five months ended December 31, 2021. Under separate transition services agreements, we provide DIRECTV certain operational support, including servicing of certain of their customer receivables for up to three years. For the five months ended December 31, 2021, we billed DIRECTV approximately $550 for these costs, which were primarily recorded as a reduction to the operations and support expenses incurred and resulted in net retained costs to AT&amp;T of approximately $200.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, we had accounts receivable from DIRECTV of $436 and accounts payable to DIRECTV of $329.\n\nWe are not committed, implicitly or explicitly, to provide financial or other support, other than noted above, as our involvement with DIRECTV is limited to the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities recognized on our balance sheet.",

The financing obligation is increased by interest expense and estimated future net cash flows generated and retained by Crown Castle from operation of the tower sites, and reduced by our contractual payments. We continue to include the tower assets in 'Property, Plant and Equipment - Net' on our consolidated balance sheets and depreciate them accordingly. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the tower assets had a balance of $725 and $764, respectively. Our depreciation expense for these assets was $39 for each of 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nPayments made to Crown Castle under this arrangement were $253 for 2021. At December 31, 2021, the future minimum payments under the sublease arrangement are $258 for 2022, $264 for 2023, $269 for 2024, $274 for 2025, $280 for 2026 and $707 thereafter.\n\n## NOTE 20. TRANSACTIONS WITH DIRECTV\n\nOn July 31, 2021, we closed our transaction with TPG to form a new company named DIRECTV (see Note 6). The transaction resulted in our deconsolidation of the Video business. Effective August 1, 2021, we began accounting for our investment in DIRECTV under the equity method and recorded our share of DIRECTV earnings as equity in net income of affiliates, with DIRECTV considered a related party (see Note 10).\n\nFor the five months ended December 31, 2021, our share of DIRECTV's earnings included in equity in net income of affiliates was $619. Cash distributions from DIRECTV totaled $1,942, with $619 classified as operating activities and $1,323 classified as investing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\nIn addition to the assets and liabilities contributed to DIRECTV, we recorded total obligations of approximately $2,100 to cover certain net losses under the NFL SUNDAY TICKET contract, of which $1,800 is in the form of a note payable to DIRECTV (see Note 6). Cash payments to DIRECTV on the note totaled $459 and were classified as financing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows. Amounts due under the DIRECTV note were $1,341 at December 31, 2021.\n\nThrough our WarnerMedia properties, we license content and programming and provide advertising services to DIRECTV. Revenue recognized from DIRECTV, which was previously eliminated, totaled approximately $670 for the five months ended December 31, 2021. We also provide DIRECTV with network transport for U-verse products and sales services under commercial arrangements for up to five years.\n\nPursuant to a commercial agreement, WarnerMedia continues to sell DIRECTV's advertising inventory under a revenue sharing agreement. WarnerMedia records amounts billed as advertising revenue and recognizes expense for DIRECTV's revenue share, which was approximately $600 for the five months ended December 31, 2021. Under separate transition services agreements, we provide DIRECTV certain operational support, including servicing of certain of their customer receivables for up to three years. For the five months ended December 31, 2021, we billed DIRECTV approximately $550 for these costs, which were primarily recorded as a reduction to the operations and support expenses incurred and resulted in net retained costs to AT&amp;T of approximately $200.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, we had accounts receivable from DIRECTV of $436 and accounts payable to DIRECTV of $329.\n\nWe are not committed, implicitly or explicitly, to provide financial or other support, other than noted above, as our involvement with DIRECTV is limited to the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities recognized on our balance sheet.",

          "chunk_text": "## AT&amp;T Inc.\n\nOur ILEC subsidiaries are subject to regulation by state governments, which have the power to regulate intrastate rates and services, including local, long-distance and network access services, provided such state regulation is consistent with federal law. Some states have eliminated or reduced regulations on our retail offerings. In addition, many states have adopted legislation that enables us to provide IP-based video service through a single statewide or state-approved franchise to offer a competitive video product. These subsidiaries are also subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC with respect to intercarrier compensation, interconnection, and interstate and international rates and services, including interstate access charges. Access charges are a form of intercarrier compensation designed to reimburse our wireline subsidiaries for the use of their networks by other carriers.\n\nOur subsidiaries operating outside the United States are subject to the jurisdiction of national and supranational regulatory authorities in the market where service is provided.\n\nThe following discussion highlights significant regulatory issues directly affecting our operations:\n\n## Communications Segment\n\n## Wireless\n\nThe industry-wide deployment of 5G technology, which is needed to meet exploding demand for wireless data, involves modifications of existing cell sites to add equipment supporting new frequencies, like the C-Band and the newly auctioned 3.45 GHz band, increasing the importance of local permitting processes that allow for approving those modifications on reasonable timelines and terms. In June and November 2020, the FCC issued a Declaratory Ruling clarifying the limits on state and local authority to deny applications to modify existing structures to accommodate wireless facilities. Those clarifications facilitate quicker deployment of next-generation wireless equipment and services. The FCC Order was appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, where it remains pending, following multiple requests by the FCC to hold the appeal in abeyance until the Senate confirms a fifth FCC Commissioner. In addition, to date, 31 states and Puerto Rico have adopted legislation to facilitate small cell deployment.\n\nIn March 2020, the FCC released its order setting rules for certain spectrum bands (C-band) for 5G operations. In that order, the FCC concluded that C-band 5G services that met the agency's technical limits on power and emissions would not cause harmful interference with aircraft operations. In reliance on that order, AT&amp;T bid a total of $23,406 and was awarded 1,621 C-band licenses, including 40 MHz nationwide available for deployment in December 2021, with the remainder available for deployment in December 2023. In late 2021, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) questioned whether the C-band launch could impact radio altimeter equipment on airplanes, which operate on spectrum bands over 400 MHz away from the spectrum AT&amp;T is launching in 2022. In response, to allow the FAA more time to evaluate, AT&amp;T and Verizon delayed their planned December 2021 5G C-band launch by six weeks and voluntarily committed to a series of temporary, precautionary measures, in addition to deferring turning on a limited number of towers around certain airports. On January 19, 2022, we launched 5G C-band services, subject to these voluntary temporary measures.\n\n## Internet\n\nIn February 2015, the FCC released an order classifying both fixed and mobile consumer broadband internet access services as telecommunications services, subject to Title II of the Communications Act. The Order, which represented a departure from longstanding bipartisan precedent, significantly expanded the FCC's authority to regulate broadband internet access services, as well as internet interconnection arrangements. In December 2017, the FCC reversed its 2015 decision by reclassifying fixed and mobile consumer broadband services as information services and repealing most of the rules that were adopted in 2015. In lieu of broad conduct prohibitions, the order requires internet service providers to disclose information about their network practices and terms of service, including whether they block or throttle internet traffic or offer paid prioritization. On October 1, 2019, the D.C. Circuit issued a unanimous opinion upholding the FCC's reclassification of broadband as an information service, and its reliance on transparency requirements and competitive marketplace dynamics to safeguard net neutrality. Because no party sought Supreme Court review of the D.C. Circuit's decision to uphold the FCC's classification of broadband as an information service, that decision is final. While the court vacated the FCC's express preemption of any state regulation of net neutrality, it stressed that its ruling did not prevent the FCC or ISPs from relying on conflict preemption to invalidate particular state laws that are inconsistent with the FCC's regulatory objectives and framework. The court also remanded the matter to the FCC for further consideration of the impact of reclassifying broadband services as information services on public safety, the Lifeline program, and pole attachment regulation. In October 2020, the FCC adopted an order concluding that those issues did not justify reversing its decision to reclassify broadband services as information services. An appeal of the FCC's remand decision is pending.",

We provided to the FCC an upfront deposit of $550 in 2020 and cash payments totaling $22,856 in the first quarter of 2021, for a total of $23,406. We received the licenses in July 2021 and classified the auction deposits, related capitalized interest and billed relocation costs as 'Licenses - Net' on our December 31, 2021 consolidated balance sheet. In December 2021, we paid $955 of Incentive Payments for the clearing of Phase I spectrum and estimate that we will be responsible for an additional $2,112 upon clearing of Phase II spectrum, expected by the end of 2023. Additionally, we are responsible for approximately $1,000 of compensable relocation costs over the next several years as the spectrum is being cleared by satellite operators, of which $650 was paid in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nOn January 14, 2022, the FCC announced that we were the winning bidder for 1,624 3.45 GHz licenses in Auction 110. We provided the FCC an upfront deposit of $123 in the third quarter of 2021 and will pay the remaining $8,956 in the first quarter of 2022, for a total of $9,079. We intend to fund the purchase price using cash and short-term investments.\n\nVideo Business On July 31, 2021, we closed our transaction with TPG to form a new company named DIRECTV, which is jointly governed by a board with representation from both AT&amp;T and TPG, with TPG having tie-breaking authority on certain key decisions. With the close of the transaction, we separated our Video business, comprised of our U.S. video operations, and began accounting for our investment in DIRECTV under the equity method.\n\nIn connection with the transaction, we contributed our U.S. Video business unit to DIRECTV for $4,250 of junior preferred units, an additional distribution preference of $4,200 and a 70% economic interest in common units (collectively 'equity considerations'). Upon close, we received approximately $7,170 in cash from DIRECTV ($7,600, net of $430 cash on hand) and transferred $195 of DIRECTV debt. TPG contributed approximately $1,800 in cash to DIRECTV for $1,800 of senior preferred units and a 30% economic interest in common units. As part of this transaction, we agreed to cover net losses under the NFL SUNDAY TICKET contract up to a cap of $2,100 over the remaining period of the contract, of which $1,800 was a note payable to DIRECTV.\n\nUnder separate transition services agreements, we will provide DIRECTV certain operational support for up to three years. We also have entered into commercial arrangements, for up to five years, to provide network transport for U-verse products and sales services.\n\nWarnerMedia On May 17, 2021, we entered into an agreement to combine our WarnerMedia segment, subject to certain exceptions, with a subsidiary of Discovery, Inc. (Discovery). The agreement is structured as a Reverse Morris Trust transaction, under which WarnerMedia will be distributed to AT&amp;T's shareholders via a pro rata dividend, an exchange offer, or a combination of both, followed by its combination with Discovery. The transaction is expected to be tax-free to AT&amp;T and AT&amp;T's shareholders. AT&amp;T will receive approximately $43,000 (subject to working capital and other adjustments) in a combination of cash, debt securities, and WarnerMedia's retention of certain debt. AT&amp;T's shareholders will receive stock representing approximately 71% of the new company; Discovery shareholders will own approximately 29% of the new company.\n\nOn February 1, 2022, we announced that we will structure the distribution as a spin-off rather than an exchange offer. Upon closing of the transaction, each AT&amp;T shareholder will receive, on a tax-free basis, an estimated 0.24 shares of the new company for each share of AT&amp;T common stock held as of the record date for the pro rata distribution. The exact number of shares to be received by AT&amp;T shareholders for each AT&amp;T common share will be determined closer to the closing based on the number of shares of AT&amp;T common stock outstanding and the number of shares of Discovery common stock outstanding on an as-converted and as-exercised basis. AT&amp;T shareholders will continue to hold the same number of shares of AT&amp;T common stock after the transaction closes.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022, subject to approval by Discovery shareholders and customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals. No vote is required by AT&amp;T shareholders. Upon close of the transaction, WarnerMedia will be deconsolidated.\n\nThe merger agreement contains certain customary termination rights for AT&amp;T and Discovery, including, without limitation, a right for either party to terminate if the transaction is not completed on or before July 15, 2023. Termination fees under specified circumstances will require Discovery to pay AT&amp;T $720 or AT&amp;T to pay Discovery $1,770.\n\nMagallanes, Inc. (Spinco), a subsidiary of AT&amp;T, entered into a $41,500 commitment letter (Bridge Loan) on May 17, 2021. On June 4, 2021, Spinco entered into a $10,000 term loan credit agreement (Spinco Term Loan) and reduced the aggregate commitment amount under the Bridge Loan to $31,500. There have been no draws on the Bridge Loan or the Spinco Term Loan. In the event advances are made under the Bridge Loan or Spinco Term Loan, those advances will be used by Spinco to finance a portion of the cash distribution to AT&amp;T in connection with the transaction.",

Some contracts have fixed terms and others are cancellable on a short-term basis (i.e., month-to-month arrangements).\n\nExamples of service revenues include wireless, strategic services (e.g., virtual private network service), and legacy voice and data (e.g., traditional local and long-distance). These services represent a series of distinct services that is considered a separate performance obligation. Service revenue is recognized when services are provided, based upon either usage (e.g., minutes of traffic/bytes of data processed) or period of time (e.g., monthly service fees).\n\nSome of our services require customer premises equipment that, when combined and integrated with AT&amp;T's specific network infrastructure, facilitates the delivery of service to the customer. In evaluating whether the equipment is a separate performance obligation, we consider the customer's ability to benefit from the equipment on its own or together with other readily available resources and if so, whether the service and equipment are separately identifiable (i.e., is the service highly dependent on, or highly interrelated with the equipment). When the equipment does not meet the criteria to be a separate performance obligation (e.g., equipment associated with certain video services), we allocate the total transaction price to the related service. When equipment is a separate performance obligation, we record the sale of equipment when title has passed and the products are accepted by the customer. For devices sold through indirect channels (e.g., national dealers), revenue is recognized when the dealer accepts the device, not upon activation.\n\nOur equipment and service revenues are predominantly recognized on a gross basis, as most of our services do not involve a third party and we typically control the equipment that is sold to our customers.",

They may offer more compelling content or secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video. In addition, new technological developments, including the development and use of generative artificial intelligence, are rapidly evolving. If our competitors gain an advantage by using such technologies more effectively to satisfy consumer demand, our ability to compete successfully and our results of operations could be adversely impacted. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. Piracy also threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. In light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth, and our efforts to prevent that growth may be insufficient. If we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors and win moments of truth, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share, revenues or profitability.\n\n## We face risks, such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute through our service.\n\nAs a producer and distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright and trademark infringement, or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute. We also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service, including marketing materials. We devote significant resources toward the development, production, marketing and distribution of original programming. We believe that original and exclusive programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings, enhance our brand and otherwise attract and retain members. To the extent our programming does not meet our expectations, in particular, in terms of costs, viewing and popularity, our business, including our brand and results of operations may be adversely impacted. As a content producer, we are responsible for production costs and other expenses, such as ongoing guild payments, and take on risks associated with production, such as completion and key talent risk. Further, negotiations or renewals related to entertainment industry collective bargaining agreements have, and in the future, could negatively impact timing and costs associated with our productions. We contract with third parties related to the development, production, marketing and distribution of our original programming. We may face potential liability or may suffer significant losses in connection with these arrangements, including but not limited to if such third parties violate applicable law, become insolvent or engage in fraudulent behavior. To the extent we create and sell physical or digital merchandise relating to our programming, and/or license such rights to third parties, we could become subject to product liability, intellectual property or other claims related to such merchandise. We may decide to remove content from our service, not to place licensed or produced content on our service or discontinue or alter production of original content if we believe such content might not be well received by our members, is prohibited by law, or could be damaging to our brand or business.\n\nTo the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks, including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on or is removed from our service, or if we become liable for content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute, our business may suffer. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations. We may not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims.\n\n## If we are not able to manage change and growth, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nWe are expanding our operations, scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members and features related to our services, such as introducing games and advertising on our service, as well as offering live programming and expanding our consumer products and experiences. We are also scaling our own studio operations to produce original content. As our international offering evolves, we are managing and adjusting our business to address varied content offerings, consumer customs and practices, in particular those dealing with e-commerce and streaming video, as well as differing legal and regulatory environments. As we scale our streaming service and introduce new features such as our ad-supported subscription plan and live programming, we are developing technology and utilizing third-party 'cloud' computing, technology and other services. As we scale our content production, including games, and introduce new features and expand our consumer products and experience offerings, we are building out expertise in a number of disciplines, including creative, marketing, legal, finance, licensing, merchandising and other resources, which requires significant resources and management attention. Further, we may expand our content and service offerings in a manner that is not well received by consumers. As we grow our operations, we may face integration and operational challenges as well as potential unknown liabilities and reputational concerns in connection with partners we work with or companies we may acquire or control. If we are not able to manage the growing complexity of our business, including improving, refining or evolving our corporate culture, as well as our systems and operational practices related to our streaming operations and original content, our business may be adversely affected.\n\n## If we fail to maintain a positiv e reputation concerning our serv ice and the content w e offer, w e may not be able to attract or retain members, w e may face regulatory scrutiny and our operating results may be adversely affected.\n\nWe believe that a positive reputation concerning our service is important in attracting and retaining members. To the extent our content is perceived as low quality, offensive or otherwise not compelling to consumers, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted. To the extent our content is deemed controversial or offensive by government regulators, we may face direct or indirect",

In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business\n\n## If our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.\n\nWe must continually add new members both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. Our ability to continue to attract and retain members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members in countries around the globe with compelling content choices that keep our members engaged with our service, effectively drive conversation around our content and service, as well as provide a quality experience for choosing and enjoying TV series, films and games. Our penetration and growth rates have fluctuated and vary across the jurisdictions where we provide our service. In countries where we have been operating for many years or where we are highly penetrated, our membership growth is slower than in newer or less penetrated countries. Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain members. Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as linear television, and streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers, as well as user-generated content, some of which are by professional content creators, and more broadly other sources of entertainment, such as social media, that our members could choose in their moments of free time.\n\nMembers cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, that they need to cut household expenses, dissatisfaction with content, a preference for competitive services and customer service issues that they believe are not satisfactorily resolved. Membership growth is also impacted by seasonality, with the fourth quarter historically representing our greatest growth, as well as the timing of our content release schedules. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, may also adversely impact our ability to attract and retain members. If we do not grow as expected, given, in particular, that our content costs are largely fix ed in nature, we may not be able to adjust our ex penditures or increase our (per membership) revenues, including by adjusting membership pricing, commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operations may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in providing compelling content, retaining our existing members and attracting new members, our business will be adversely affected.\n\n## If we do not continuously provide value to our members, including making improvements to our service in a manner that is favorably received by them, our revenue, results of operations and business will be adversely affected.\n\nIf consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existing features, adjust pricing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain members, and accordingly, our revenue and results of operations may be adversely affected. We expanded our entertainment video offering to include games and, more recently, live programming. If our efforts to sustain and improve our existing TV and film offering, as well as develop and expand our video entertainment options, are not done in a manner valued by our current and future members, our ability to attract and retain members may be negatively impacted. We may also seek to extend our business into new products and services to help drive growth. For example, we continue to expand our offering of consumer products and live experiences. To the extent we cannot successfully find and develop new products, experiences and services to help drive growth, or we do not realize the expected benefits or generate additional revenue from such new products, experiences, and services, our future results of operations and growth may be adversely impacted.\n\nWe have and may, from time to time, adjust our membership pricing, our membership plans, or our pricing model itself, including for example, the lower-priced ad-supported subscription plan. Similarly, we have increased enforcement of and will continue to enforce our terms of use to limit multi-household usage and shared viewing outside of a household. These and other adjustments we make may not be well-received by consumers, and could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain members, revenue and our results of operations. In addition, many of our members rejoin our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts to satisfy our ex isting members or adjustments to our service are not successful, we may not be able to attract or retain members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be adversely affected.\n\n## Changes in competitive offerings for entertainment video could adversely impact our business.\n\nThe market for entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. We face competition from traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers and platforms. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content, large content libraries, and significant",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Critical Accounting E stimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n## Content\n\nWe acquire, license and produce content, including original programming, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fix ed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nWe recognize content assets (licensed and produced) as \"Content assets, net\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and production overhead.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in 'Cost of revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as we typically ex pect more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability. We review factors that impact the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis. Our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\n\nIn the normal course of business, we, or a third-party producing content on our behalf, may qualify for tax incentives through eligible spend on productions. The accounting for tax incentives is dependent on the particular type of incentive, including the nature of the benefit and the location the incentive is earned. In general, tax  incentives are realized as cash receipts and may be received prior to or after a title launches on our service. Upon a title's launch, any amounts we are eligible for through qualified production spend but have not received, are recognized in 'Other current assets' or 'Other non-current assets' on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as receivables. Tax incentives are generally accounted for as a reduction to the cost basis of content assets (presented in 'Content assets, net') and reduce content amortization over the life of the title (as presented in 'Cost of revenues') on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nOur business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are ex pected to be, abandoned are written off.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax  bases as well as net operating loss and tax  credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax  assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not they will not be realized.\n\nAlthough we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax  assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, our forecast of future earnings and future tax able income, and prudent and feasible tax  planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in determining future tax able income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business. Actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates.",

In addition, uncertain tax  positions, tax -related valuation allowances and pre-acquisition contingencies are initially recorded in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date.\n\n## Property and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally up to 30 years, or the ex pected lease term for leasehold improvements, if applicable.\n\n## Trade Receivables\n\nTrade receivables primarily consist of membership and advertising fees due to the Company. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance for credit losses based on historical collection trends, the financial condition of its payment partners, and ex ternal market factors.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company's primary source of revenues is from monthly membership fees.

      "answer": "Netflix's pricing strategy, which includes a range of membership plans priced between $1 and $32 per month as of December 31, 2024, could conflict with its ability to retain existing members if price increases or plan adjustments are not favorably received. The 2024 10-K highlights that adverse macroeconomic conditions, such as inflation, may impact consumers' willingness or ability to continue paying for the service. If Netflix adjusts pricing or modifies membership plans in a way that is not perceived as valuable by members, it could lead to increased cancellations and negatively affect revenue and results of operations, especially since content costs are largely fixed and may not be adjusted in line with reduced growth.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Netflix faces risks related to macroeconomic conditions like inflation impacting member retention.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Netflix offers a variety of membership plans with pricing ranging from $1 to $32 per month as of December 31, 2024.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - If Netflix raises prices or changes plans amid inflationary pressures, members may cancel subscriptions, harming revenue despite the broad pricing strategy."

In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business\n\n## If our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.\n\nWe must continually add new members both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. Our ability to continue to attract and retain members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members in countries around the globe with compelling content choices that keep our members engaged with our service, effectively drive conversation around our content and service, as well as provide a quality experience for choosing and enjoying TV series, films and games. Our penetration and growth rates have fluctuated and vary across the jurisdictions where we provide our service. In countries where we have been operating for many years or where we are highly penetrated, our membership growth is slower than in newer or less penetrated countries. Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain members. Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as linear television, and streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers, as well as user-generated content, some of which are by professional content creators, and more broadly other sources of entertainment, such as social media, that our members could choose in their moments of free time.\n\nMembers cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, that they need to cut household expenses, dissatisfaction with content, a preference for competitive services and customer service issues that they believe are not satisfactorily resolved. Membership growth is also impacted by seasonality, with the fourth quarter historically representing our greatest growth, as well as the timing of our content release schedules. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, may also adversely impact our ability to attract and retain members. If we do not grow as expected, given, in particular, that our content costs are largely fix ed in nature, we may not be able to adjust our ex penditures or increase our (per membership) revenues, including by adjusting membership pricing, commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operations may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in providing compelling content, retaining our existing members and attracting new members, our business will be adversely affected.\n\n## If we do not continuously provide value to our members, including making improvements to our service in a manner that is favorably received by them, our revenue, results of operations and business will be adversely affected.\n\nIf consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existing features, adjust pricing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain members, and accordingly, our revenue and results of operations may be adversely affected. We expanded our entertainment video offering to include games and, more recently, live programming. If our efforts to sustain and improve our existing TV and film offering, as well as develop and expand our video entertainment options, are not done in a manner valued by our current and future members, our ability to attract and retain members may be negatively impacted. We may also seek to extend our business into new products and services to help drive growth. For example, we continue to expand our offering of consumer products and live experiences. To the extent we cannot successfully find and develop new products, experiences and services to help drive growth, or we do not realize the expected benefits or generate additional revenue from such new products, experiences, and services, our future results of operations and growth may be adversely impacted.\n\nWe have and may, from time to time, adjust our membership pricing, our membership plans, or our pricing model itself, including for example, the lower-priced ad-supported subscription plan. Similarly, we have increased enforcement of and will continue to enforce our terms of use to limit multi-household usage and shared viewing outside of a household. These and other adjustments we make may not be well-received by consumers, and could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain members, revenue and our results of operations. In addition, many of our members rejoin our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts to satisfy our ex isting members or adjustments to our service are not successful, we may not be able to attract or retain members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be adversely affected.\n\n## Changes in competitive offerings for entertainment video could adversely impact our business.\n\nThe market for entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. We face competition from traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers and platforms. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content, large content libraries, and significant",

Our  home  service  group  performs  various  tasks,  including  installations,  servicing  and  upgrades  of customer premise equipment. Customers can use self-service help and support and perform self-installations for certain services.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe compete with a broad range of companies engaged in media, entertainment and communications services in Europe. For video services,  we  compete  with  cable  operators,  providers  of  both  paid-for  and  free-to-air  programming,  other  satellite  television providers, digital terrestrial television providers, content aggregators, home entertainment products companies, and other suppliers and providers of sports, entertainment, news and information that deliver DTC and other OTT streaming services. For broadband and wireless services, we compete with service providers making use of new fiber-optic networks, telecommunications providers, other  internet  service  providers  and  companies  developing  new  technologies  and  devices.  Our  competitive  position  may  be negatively impacted by an increase in the capacity of, or developments in, the means of delivery competitors use to provide their services as well as lowered prices, product innovations, new technologies or different value creation approaches. We also compete with organizations that are publicly funded, in whole or in part, to fulfill a public service broadcasting mandate.\n\nOur owned channels compete for the acquisition of content and for on-air and creative talent with other television networks and with DTC streaming and other OTT service providers. The market for content is very competitive, particularly for sports rights, where the cost for such content is significant.\n\nWe compete for the  sale  of  advertising  with  other  television  networks  and  stations,  digital  platforms,  and  all  other  advertising platforms. Similar to the competitive environment in our Media segment, the willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from  us  may  be  adversely  affected  by  declines  in  television  viewership  and  the  increasing  number  of  entertainment  choices available.\n\n## Corporate and Other\n\nOur other business interests consist primarily of the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and other business initiatives, including Sky Glass and XClass TV, which launched in the fourth quarter of 2021. Sky Glass and XClass TV are smart televisions with operating systems that leverage our global technology platforms similar to Sky Q, X1 and Flex. We sell Sky Glass televisions in Europe, with the United Kingdom as the first market, to consumers that also subscribe to Sky's video services. XClass TVs are manufactured and sold by third parties and operate on our XClass TV operating system.\n\n## Seasonality and Cyclicality\n\nEach of our businesses is typically subject to seasonal and cyclical variations. Cable Communications' results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving our services in college and vacation markets. This generally results in fewer net customer relationship additions in the second quarter of each year.\n\nRevenue  and  operating  costs  and  expenses  (comprised  of  total  costs  and  expenses,  excluding  depreciation  and  amortization expense) in our Media segment are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events, such as the Olympic Games and the Super Bowl. In particular, advertising revenue increases due to increased demand for advertising time for these events and distribution revenue increases in the period of broadcasts of the Olympic Games. Operating costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs for these broadcasts and the amortization of the related rights fees.\n\nRevenue in Cable Communications, Media and Sky is also subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Advertising revenue in the United States is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of each year and in even-numbered years due to increases in advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season, and advertising related  to  candidates  running  for  political  office  and  issue-oriented  advertising,  respectively.  Revenue  in  Media  also  fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired, which typically results in additional advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year. Advertising revenue in Sky typically has seasonally higher audience levels in winter months and increased competition in the summer during major sporting events where public service broadcasters lease the rights, such as the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup . TM\n\nRevenue in Studios fluctuates due to the timing, nature and number of films released in movie theaters, on DVDs, and through various other distribution platforms, including viewing on demand, DTC platforms or OTT service providers. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. As a result, revenue tends to be seasonal, with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the holiday season. We incur",

Our  platform  incorporates  Wi-Fi  connectivity  for  in-home  distribution  that  allows  wireless, multiroom consumption. We have also developed a range of back-end and client software applications that provide customers with access to our content across multiple third-party devices.\n\nUnder the current regulatory regime in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Italy, we are able to access networks owned by third-party telecommunications providers for a fee to provide our broadband, voice, and wireless services in many cases, on regulated terms. We  offer  broadband  and  voice  services  in  the  United  Kingdom  using  a  combination  of  our  own  core  fiber  network  and  BT Openreach's core and 'last mile' network under a wholesale and fee-based arrangement and in Italy primarily using Open Fiber's network. We offer wireless services to customers in the United Kingdom using a combination of an arrangement to access network assets from Telef\u00f3nica and our own mobile core network .\n\nWe continue to focus on technology initiatives to design, develop and deploy next-generation media and content delivery platforms, including Sky Q and NOW, that deliver video content, provide advanced search capabilities, including through a voice-activated remote control, and provide access to and integration of certain other DTC streaming services. These platforms and, more recently, Sky Glass leverage our global technology platform. Sky Glass is a smart television that we launched in the fourth quarter of 2021 in the  United  Kingdom,  with  an  operating  system  that  provides  a  video  service  similar  to  Sky  Q  over  a  broadband  connection, eliminating the need for a satellite dish or set-top box.\n\n## Sources of Supply and Other Operations\n\n## Programming\n\nOur owned television channels and NOW streaming service include content both owned by us and licensed from third parties and NBCUniversal. In some cases, licenses  are  on  an  exclusive  basis. We  have  various  multiyear  contractual  commitments  for  the licensing  of  programming,  primarily  sports  rights  and  exclusive  entertainment  content.  Our  most  significant  sports  rights commitments include  European  football  broadcast  rights  for  Premier  League  games  through  the  2024-25  season  in  the  United Kingdom and Bundesliga games through the 2024-25 season in Germany. We also have broadcast rights to Formula One through 2024 in the United Kingdom and Germany and through 2022 in Italy, English and Wales Cricket Board cricket games through 2024 in the United Kingdom, and Union of European Football Associations Champions League ('UCL') through the 2023-24 season in Italy, as well as non-exclusive broadcast rights to certain Serie A games through the 2023-24 season in Italy.\n\nOur  most  significant  commitments  for  the  licensing  of  film  and  television  entertainment  content  include  exclusive  rights  with HBO, Paramount, Warner  Bros.  and  NBCUniversal.  We  also  produce  and  air  live  news  and  sports  programming  and  produce certain original programming through Sky Studios. We are increasingly creating and investing in original scripted content that is broadcast across all of our territories and sold to other markets. We also are constructing a new studio production facility in Elstree, U.K.\n\nTo offer video services, in addition to our owned channels, we license substantial amounts of programming from third parties. The fees associated with these programming distribution agreements are generally based on the number of customers that are able to watch the programming and the platforms on which the content is provided. We seek to include in distribution agreements the rights to offer such programming through multiple delivery platforms, such as through our on demand services, mobile apps and our NOW streaming service.\n\n## Other\n\nWe purchase from a limited number of suppliers a significant amount of customer premise equipment, including set-top boxes, wireless hubs and network equipment to provide our video and broadband services to residential and business customers. We also purchase from a limited number of suppliers a significant number of wireless handsets and tablets that are sold to customers that receive our wireless services.\n\nWe offer direct-to-consumer services to residential and business customers through our customer service teams, customer service centers, websites, telemarketing, and a limited number of retail stores, as well as through advertising via direct mail,",

      "answer": "The launch of Sky Glass and XClass TV had a dual impact on Comcast's Corporate and Other segment: the sale of Sky Glass televisions contributed to revenue growth in 2021, while both product launches led to increased costs. Specifically, the Corporate and Other section notes that revenue increased in 2021 due to sales of Sky Glass televisions. However, expenses were affected by costs related to both Sky Glass and XClass TV, which partially offset the overall expense decrease from prior-year cost-saving initiatives such as severance charges in 2020. The company also projected increased costs for 2022 due to the continued launches of these products.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Revenue increased in 2021 due to sales of Sky Glass televisions.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Alphabet Inc.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Nature of Operations\n\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\n\nWe generate revenues by deliv ering relev ant, cost-effectiv e online adv ertising; cloud-based solutions that prov ide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure, platform serv ices, and applications; sales of other products and serv ices, such as fees receiv ed for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and dev ices.\n\n## Basis of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the v ariable interest and v oting models. Intercompany balances and transactions hav e been eliminated.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported  and  disclosed  in  the  financial  statements  and  the  accompanying  notes. Actual  results  could  differ  materially  from  these  estimates  due  to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we ev aluate our estimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; contingent liabilities; fair v alues of financial instruments and goodwill; income taxes; inv entory; and useful liv es of property and equipment, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believ ed to be reasonable, and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying v alues of assets and liabilities.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or serv ices is transferred to our customers, and the collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or serv ices is probable. Sales and other similar taxes are excluded from rev enues.\n\n## Advertising Revenues\n\nWe generate advertising rev enues primarily by deliv ering adv ertising on:\n\n- Google  Search  and  other  properties,  including  rev enues  from  traffic  generated  by  search  distribution  partners  who  use  Google.com  as  their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n- YouTube properties; and\n- Google Network properties, including rev enues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\n\nOur  customers  generally  purchase  adv ertising  inv entory  through  Google Ads,  Google Ad  Manager,  Google  Display  &amp;  Video  360,  and  Google Marketing Platform, among others.\n\nWe offer adv ertising by deliv ering both performance and brand adv ertising. We recognize rev enues for performance adv ertising when a user engages with the adv ertisement. For brand adv ertising, we recognize rev enues when the ad is displayed, or a user v iews the ad.\n\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we ev aluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report rev enues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report rev enues on a net basis). Generally, we report adv ertising rev enues for ads placed on Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as rev enues, and amounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of rev enues. Where we are the principal,  we  control  the  adv ertising  inv entory  before  it  is  transferred  to  our  customers.  Our  control  is  ev idenced  by  our  sole  ability  to  monetize  the advertising inv entory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers and hav ing a lev el of discretion in establishing pricing.\n\n## Google Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices\n\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and dev ices rev enues consist of rev enues from:",

We report rev enues from Google Play sales of apps and in-app purchases on a net basis because our performance obligation is to facilitate a transaction between app dev elopers and end users for which we earn a serv ice fee.\n\n## Google Cloud Revenues\n\nGoogle Cloud rev enues consist of rev enues from:\n\n- Google  Cloud  Platform,  which  generates  consumption-based  fees  and  subscriptions  for  infrastructure,  platform,  and  other  serv ices.  T hese serv ices  prov ide  access  to  solutions  such  as AI  offerings  including  our AI  infrastructure,  Vertex AI  platform,  and  Gemini  for  Google  Cloud; cybersecurity; and data and analytics;\n- Google  Workspace, which includes subscriptions  for  cloud-based  communication  and  collaboration  tools  for  enterprises,  such  as  Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Driv e, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for Google Workspace; and\n- other enterprise serv ices.\n\nOur cloud serv ices are generally prov ided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may hav e contract terms longer than a year.

For such arrangements, we allocate rev enues to each performance obligation based on its relativ e standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers.\n\n## Customer Incentives and Credits\n\nCertain customers receiv e cash-based incentiv es or credits, which are accounted for as v ariable consideration. We estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce rev enues. We believ e that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration related to customer incentiv es and credits.\n\n## Sales Commissions\n\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred when the period of the expected benefit is one year or less. We recognize an asset for certain sales commissions and amortize if the expected benefit period is greater than one year. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.\n\n## Cost of Revenues\n\nCost of rev enues consists of TAC and other costs of rev enues.\n\n- TAC includes:\n- amounts paid to our distribution partners who make av ailable our search access points and serv ices. Our distribution partners include browser prov iders, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software dev elopers; and\n- amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n- Other cost of rev enues includes:\n- content  acquisition  costs,  which  are  payments  to  content  prov iders  from  whom  we  license  v ideo  and  other  content  for  distribution, primarily related to YouTube (we pay fees to these content prov iders based on rev enues generated, subscriber counts, or a flat fee);\n- depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure;",

At Google, we hav e been bringing AI into our products and serv ices for more than a decade and making them av ailable to our users.\n\nIn 2023, we took a significant step on our journey to make AI more helpful for ev eryone with the introduction of Gemini, our nativ ely multimodal AI model. In 2024, we launched Gemini 2.0, our most capable model yet. Gemini can generalize and seamlessly understand, operate across, and combine different types of information including text, code, audio, image, and v ideo. Gemini is powering AI features across our products and serv ices that are helping people ev eryday. T oday, all sev en of our two billion-user products - Android, Chrome, Gmail, Maps, Play Store, Search, and YouTube - are using Gemini.\n\nOur Google Cloud products, including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, help organizations stay at the forefront of innov ation with our AI-optimized infrastructure, AI dev elopment platform, world-class models, as well as assistiv e agents and applications.\n\nWe believe AI  has  the  potential  to  solv e  important  societal,  scientific,  and  engineering  challenges.  For  example,  in  2020,  Google  DeepMind's AlphaFold system solved a 50-year-old protein folding challenge, and in 2024, we introduced AlphaFold 3, built on the prev ious models, to predict the structure and interactions of all the molecules in life's processes.\n\nWe are focused on transforming our products to prov ide the most helpful tools to our users and customers as we deliv er on our mission to organize the world's information and make it univ ersally accessible and useful.\n\n## Deliver the Most Advanced, Safe, and Responsible AI\n\nWe aim to build the most advanced, safe, and responsible AI through a full stack of robust AI-optimized infrastructure, including data centers, chips, and a global fiber network; world class research teams; and a broad global reach through products and platforms that touch billions of people and customers around the world.\n\nWe are driv ing efficiencies in our data centers, while making significant hardware and model improv ements. For example, since we started serv ing AI Overv iews to our users, we hav e significantly lowered machine costs and latency through hardware, engineering, and technical breakthroughs. Our AIoptimized infrastructure allows us to use, and offer our customers, a range of AI accelerator options, including our own custom-built T ensor Processing Units (TPUs).\n\nOur teams across Alphabet lev erage Gemini, as well as other AI models we hav e prev iously dev eloped and announced, to deliv er the best product and serv ice experiences for our users, adv ertisers, partners, customers, and dev elopers. We are using Gemini 2.0 in new research prototypes, including Project Astra,  which  explores  the  future  capabilities  of  a  univ ersal AI  assistant  and  Project  Mariner ,  an  early  prototype  capable  of  taking  actions  in Chrome as an experimental extension.\n\nWe believe our approach to AI must be both bold and responsible. That means dev eloping AI in a way that maximizes the positiv e benefits to society while addressing its potential challenges, guided by our AI Principles.\n\n## Enable Organizations and Developers to Innovate on Google Cloud\n\nAI is a major technology shift for enterprises. Globally, businesses from startups to large enterprises, and the public sector are thinking about how to  driv e  transformation.  T hat  is  why  we  are  focused  on  making  it  easy  and  scalable  for  others  to  innov ate,  and  grow ,  with AI.  T hat  means  prov iding advanced computing infrastructure and expanding access to Google's latest AI models. Our Vertex AI platform giv es dev elopers the ability to train, tune, augment, test, and deploy applications using Gemini, Imagen, Veo, and other generativ e AI models. Gemini for Google Cloud prov ides pre-packaged AI agents that can assist dev elopers to write, document, test, and operate software as well as assist cybersecurity teams to analyze, detect, protect, and respond to threats.\n\n## Improve Knowledge, Learning, Creativity, and Productivity\n\nAs AI continues to improv e rapidly, we are focused on transforming our products to prov ide our users the most helpful tools. Examples include AI Overviews, which allow users to ask their most complex questions, break down concepts in a format that is useful for them, or take a v ideo and ask a question out loud, and NotebookLM, which helps users understand complex information by summarizing sources and prov iding relev ant quotes. We are embedding the power of generativ e AI to continue helping our users express themselv es and get things done. For example, the Gemini app allows users to collaborate with new AI features that include image generation capabilities, coding support, and app integration. Gemini for Google Workspace helps users write,  organize,  v isualize,  accelerate  workflows,  and  hav e  richer  meetings. Additionally,  we  are  using  Gemini  to  improv e  recommendations  on YouTube. We also know businesses of all sizes around the world rely on Google Ads to find customers and grow their businesses - and we",

We report Google in two segments, Google Serv ices and Google Cloud, and  all  non-Google  businesses  collectiv ely  as  Other  Bets.  Supporting  these  businesses,  we  hav e  centralized  certain  AI-related  research  and development which is reported in Alphabet-lev el activ ities. Alphabet's structure is about helping each of our businesses prosper through strong leaders and independence.\n\n## Access and Technology for Everyone\n\nThe Internet is one of the world's most powerful equalizers; it propels ideas, people, and businesses large and small. Our mission to organize the world's information and make it univ ersally accessible and useful is as relev ant today as it was when we were founded in 1998. Since then, we hav e evolv ed from a company that helps people find answers to a company that also helps people get things done.\n\nWe are  focused  on  building  an  ev en  more  helpful  Google  for  ev eryone,  and  we  aspire  to  giv e  ev eryone  the  tools  they  need  to  increase  their knowledge, health, happiness, and success. Google Search helps people find information and make sense of the world in more natural and intuitiv e ways, with trillions of searches on Google ev ery year. YouTube prov ides people with entertainment, information, and opportunities to learn something new and helps support the creator economy through the YouTube Partner Program. Google Cloud helps customers solv e today's business challenges, improve productiv ity, reduce costs, and unlock new growth engines. We are continually innov ating and building new products and features to help our users, partners, customers, and communities and hav e inv ested more than $150 billion in research and dev elopment in the last fiv e years in support of these efforts.",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Nature of Operations\n\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\n\nWe generate revenues by deliv ering relev ant, cost-effectiv e online adv ertising; cloud-based solutions that prov ide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure, platform serv ices, and applications; sales of other products and serv ices, such as fees receiv ed for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and dev ices.\n\n## Basis of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the v ariable interest and v oting models. Intercompany balances and transactions hav e been eliminated.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported  and  disclosed  in  the  financial  statements  and  the  accompanying  notes. Actual  results  could  differ  materially  from  these  estimates  due  to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we ev aluate our estimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; contingent liabilities; fair v alues of financial instruments and goodwill; income taxes; inv entory; and useful liv es of property and equipment, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believ ed to be reasonable, and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying v alues of assets and liabilities.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or serv ices is transferred to our customers, and the collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or serv ices is probable. Sales and other similar taxes are excluded from rev enues.\n\n## Advertising Revenues\n\nWe generate advertising rev enues primarily by deliv ering adv ertising on:\n\n- Google  Search  and  other  properties,  including  rev enues  from  traffic  generated  by  search  distribution  partners  who  use  Google.com  as  their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n- YouTube properties; and\n- Google Network properties, including rev enues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\n\nOur  customers  generally  purchase  adv ertising  inv entory  through  Google Ads,  Google Ad  Manager,  Google  Display  &amp;  Video  360,  and  Google Marketing Platform, among others.\n\nWe offer adv ertising by deliv ering both performance and brand adv ertising. We recognize rev enues for performance adv ertising when a user engages with the adv ertisement. For brand adv ertising, we recognize rev enues when the ad is displayed, or a user v iews the ad.\n\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we ev aluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report rev enues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report rev enues on a net basis). Generally, we report adv ertising rev enues for ads placed on Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as rev enues, and amounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of rev enues. Where we are the principal,  we  control  the  adv ertising  inv entory  before  it  is  transferred  to  our  customers.  Our  control  is  ev idenced  by  our  sole  ability  to  monetize  the advertising inv entory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers and hav ing a lev el of discretion in establishing pricing.\n\n## Google Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices\n\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and dev ices rev enues consist of rev enues from:",

At Google, we hav e been bringing AI into our products and serv ices for more than a decade and making them av ailable to our users.\n\nIn 2023, we took a significant step on our journey to make AI more helpful for ev eryone with the introduction of Gemini, our nativ ely multimodal AI model. In 2024, we launched Gemini 2.0, our most capable model yet. Gemini can generalize and seamlessly understand, operate across, and combine different types of information including text, code, audio, image, and v ideo. Gemini is powering AI features across our products and serv ices that are helping people ev eryday. T oday, all sev en of our two billion-user products - Android, Chrome, Gmail, Maps, Play Store, Search, and YouTube - are using Gemini.\n\nOur Google Cloud products, including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, help organizations stay at the forefront of innov ation with our AI-optimized infrastructure, AI dev elopment platform, world-class models, as well as assistiv e agents and applications.\n\nWe believe AI  has  the  potential  to  solv e  important  societal,  scientific,  and  engineering  challenges.  For  example,  in  2020,  Google  DeepMind's AlphaFold system solved a 50-year-old protein folding challenge, and in 2024, we introduced AlphaFold 3, built on the prev ious models, to predict the structure and interactions of all the molecules in life's processes.\n\nWe are focused on transforming our products to prov ide the most helpful tools to our users and customers as we deliv er on our mission to organize the world's information and make it univ ersally accessible and useful.\n\n## Deliver the Most Advanced, Safe, and Responsible AI\n\nWe aim to build the most advanced, safe, and responsible AI through a full stack of robust AI-optimized infrastructure, including data centers, chips, and a global fiber network; world class research teams; and a broad global reach through products and platforms that touch billions of people and customers around the world.\n\nWe are driv ing efficiencies in our data centers, while making significant hardware and model improv ements. For example, since we started serv ing AI Overv iews to our users, we hav e significantly lowered machine costs and latency through hardware, engineering, and technical breakthroughs. Our AIoptimized infrastructure allows us to use, and offer our customers, a range of AI accelerator options, including our own custom-built T ensor Processing Units (TPUs).\n\nOur teams across Alphabet lev erage Gemini, as well as other AI models we hav e prev iously dev eloped and announced, to deliv er the best product and serv ice experiences for our users, adv ertisers, partners, customers, and dev elopers. We are using Gemini 2.0 in new research prototypes, including Project Astra,  which  explores  the  future  capabilities  of  a  univ ersal AI  assistant  and  Project  Mariner ,  an  early  prototype  capable  of  taking  actions  in Chrome as an experimental extension.\n\nWe believe our approach to AI must be both bold and responsible. That means dev eloping AI in a way that maximizes the positiv e benefits to society while addressing its potential challenges, guided by our AI Principles.\n\n## Enable Organizations and Developers to Innovate on Google Cloud\n\nAI is a major technology shift for enterprises. Globally, businesses from startups to large enterprises, and the public sector are thinking about how to  driv e  transformation.  T hat  is  why  we  are  focused  on  making  it  easy  and  scalable  for  others  to  innov ate,  and  grow ,  with AI.  T hat  means  prov iding advanced computing infrastructure and expanding access to Google's latest AI models. Our Vertex AI platform giv es dev elopers the ability to train, tune, augment, test, and deploy applications using Gemini, Imagen, Veo, and other generativ e AI models. Gemini for Google Cloud prov ides pre-packaged AI agents that can assist dev elopers to write, document, test, and operate software as well as assist cybersecurity teams to analyze, detect, protect, and respond to threats.\n\n## Improve Knowledge, Learning, Creativity, and Productivity\n\nAs AI continues to improv e rapidly, we are focused on transforming our products to prov ide our users the most helpful tools. Examples include AI Overviews, which allow users to ask their most complex questions, break down concepts in a format that is useful for them, or take a v ideo and ask a question out loud, and NotebookLM, which helps users understand complex information by summarizing sources and prov iding relev ant quotes. We are embedding the power of generativ e AI to continue helping our users express themselv es and get things done. For example, the Gemini app allows users to collaborate with new AI features that include image generation capabilities, coding support, and app integration. Gemini for Google Workspace helps users write,  organize,  v isualize,  accelerate  workflows,  and  hav e  richer  meetings. Additionally,  we  are  using  Gemini  to  improv e  recommendations  on YouTube. We also know businesses of all sizes around the world rely on Google Ads to find customers and grow their businesses - and we",

Working with content creators and partners, we continue to build new ways for people around the world to create and find great digital content.\n\nFueling all of these great digital experiences are extraordinary platforms and dev ices. T hat is why we continue to inv est in platforms like our Android mobile operating system, Chrome browser, and Chrome operating system, as well as our family of dev ices. We see tremendous potential for dev ices to be helpful and make people's liv es easier by combining the best of our AI, software, and hardware. This potential is reflected in our latest generation of devices, such as the new Pixel 9 series and the Pixel Watch 3. Creating products and serv ices that people rely on ev ery day is a journey that we are inv esting in for the long-term.\n\n## How We Make Money\n\nWe  have  built  world-class  adv ertising  technologies  for  adv ertisers,  agencies,  and  publishers  to  power  their  digital  marketing  businesses.  Our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses through our wide range of products across dev ices and formats, and we aim to ensure positiv e user experiences by serv ing the right ads at the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies. AI has been foundational to our adv ertising business for more than a decade. Products like Demand Gen, Performance Max, and Product Studio use the full power of our AI to help adv ertisers find untapped and incremental conv ersion opportunities.\n\nGoogle  Serv ices  generates  rev enues  primarily  by  deliv ering  both  performance  and  brand  adv ertising  that  appears  on  Google  Search  &amp;  other properties,  YouT ube,  and  Google  Network  partners'  properties  (\"Google  Network  properties\").  We  continue  to  inv est  in  both  performance  and  brand advertising and seek to improv e the measurability of adv ertising so adv ertisers understand the effectiv eness of their campaigns.\n\n- Performance advertising creates and deliv ers relev ant ads that users will click on leading to direct engagement with adv ertisers. Performance advertising lets our adv ertisers connect with users while driv ing measurable results. Our ads tools allow performance adv ertisers to create simple text-based ads.\n- Brand advertising helps  enhance  users'  awareness of  and  affinity  for  adv ertisers'  products  and  serv ices,  through  v ideos,  text,  images,  and other  interactiv e  ads  that  run  across  v arious  dev ices.  We  help  brand  adv ertisers  deliv er  digital  v ideos  and  other  types  of  ads  to  specific audiences for their brand-building marketing campaigns.\n\nWe have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad adv ertising practices and protecting users on the web. We focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and adv ertisers in many ways, including filtering out inv alid traffic, remov ing billions of bad ads from our systems every year, and closely monitoring the sites, apps, and v ideos where ads appear and blocklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content.\n\nIn addition, Google Serv ices increasingly generates rev enues from products and serv ices beyond adv ertising, including:\n\n- consumer subscriptions, which primarily include rev enues from YouTube serv ices, such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;\n- platforms , which primarily include rev enues from Google Play sales of apps and in-app purchases; and\n- devices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of dev ices.\n\n## Google Cloud\n\nThrough our Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace offerings, Google Cloud generates rev enues primarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, applications, and other cloud serv ices. Customers use Google Cloud in multiple ways such as:\n\n- AI-optimized Infrastructure: prov ides  open,  reliable,  and  scalable  compute,  networking, and storage to enable customers to run workloads anywhere - on our Cloud, at the edge, or in their data centers. It can be used to migrate and modernize IT systems and to train and serv e various types of AI models.\n- Developer Platform: prov ides dev elopers, through the Vertex AI platform, the ability to train, tune, augment, test, and deploy applications using Gemini and other leading generativ e AI models. We offer widely used first-party, third-party, and open models along with serv ices such as v ector search, grounding, and distillation to further improv e the cost and quality of models.\n- Cybersecurity: prov ides  AI  powered  cybersecurity  solutions  to  help  customers  analyze,  detect,  protect,  and  respond  to  a  broad  range  of cybersecurity  threats,  to  further  strengthen  security  outcomes,  prioritize  which  threats  to  inv estigate,  and  identify  attack  paths,  as  well  as accelerate resolution of cybersecurity threats.",

Performance Max leverages AI to automatically produce and run highly effective ad campaigns across all of Google's properties based on advertiser goals and creative assets, ensuring optimal ad delivery within budget constraints. Product Studio uses AI to help businesses easily create uniquely-tailored imagery featuring their products for free, enabling even small businesses to produce professional-quality visuals that improve ad engagement. These AI capabilities increase advertiser satisfaction and efficiency, leading to higher ad spend on Google's platforms.",

      "question": "Given that Google's TAC paid to Network Partners is a significant component of cost of revenues, and considering the expectation that TAC will increase as a percentage of advertising revenues due to factors like device mix and partner agreement terms, how does this trend specifically impact Google's ability to maintain or improve margins from its advertising business?",
      "answer": "Google's TAC paid to Network Partners is a key component of its cost of revenues, directly reducing gross profit. As stated in evidence_source_a, TAC includes amounts paid to Google Network partners for ads displayed on their properties. Evidence_source_b explains that TAC as a percentage of advertising revenues ('TAC rate') is expected to increase due to factors such as device mix, geographic mix, and partner agreement terms. This implies that as Google's advertising revenue grows, especially through channels with higher TAC rates (e.g., mobile or YouTube), the proportion of revenue retained by Google declines. This directly pressures advertising margins, limiting Google's ability to maintain or improve profitability from its advertising business unless offset by cost controls or higher-margin revenue growth elsewhere.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, TAC includes payments to Google Network partners for ads displayed on their properties, which is a direct cost of revenues.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, TAC as a percentage of advertising revenues ('TAC rate') is expected to increase due to factors like device mix and partner agreement terms.",
        "Step 3: An increasing TAC rate means a larger portion of advertising revenue is paid out to partners, reducing the gross margin on advertising revenues.",
        "Step 4: This trend constrains Google's ability to maintain or improve advertising margins unless counterbalanced by other factors."

      "answer": "The introduction of the ad-supported subscription plan increases financial forecasting risks because consumer adoption of new pricing strategies like this plan is inherently difficult to predict, which could lead to material discrepancies between forecasted and actual revenues, net income, and other financial metrics.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - 'predicting consumer adoption of various pricing strategies, such as the ad-supported subscription plan [...] is inherently difficult [...] actual results may differ significantly from the expectations [...] such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock.'",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - 'we introduced a new, lower-priced ad-supported subscription plan. These and other adjustments we make may not be well-received by consumers, and could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain members, revenues per paying membership, revenue and our results of operations.'",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The introduction of the ad-supported plan (from source B) directly ties into the forecasting risk (from source A), where unpredictable consumer adoption of this new pricing model could lead to significant financial forecast deviations and negatively impact revenue and stock price."

      "question": "Given Netflix's emphasis on 'moments of truth' in content engagement and the risk that fixed content costs pose to margins if membership growth slows, by what mechanism does the company's reliance on compelling content directly affect its ability to maintain profitability amid rising competition and multi-household usage enforcement?",
      "answer": "Netflix's profitability hinges on its ability to attract and retain members through compelling content, which drives 'moments of truth'\u2014the critical decision points where users choose Netflix over competing entertainment options. If Netflix fails to consistently deliver engaging content, members may cancel, and new members may not join, especially in mature markets where growth is already slower. This is compounded by the fact that content costs are largely fixed; if membership growth does not meet expectations, Netflix cannot easily reduce these costs or sufficiently raise per-membership revenue through pricing adjustments. Additionally, enforcement of terms limiting multi-household usage may further constrain membership growth, increasing the pressure to deliver content that justifies the cost for individual households. Therefore, the company's reliance on compelling content directly affects its ability to maintain profitability when faced with both rising competition and stricter enforcement of usage policies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Netflix's strategy centers on 'moments of truth' and improving content to attract and retain members.",

        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b - Enforcement of terms limiting multi-household usage may negatively impact membership growth and retention.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The combination of rising competition, fixed content costs, and usage enforcement heightens the importance of compelling content in maintaining profitability."

However, the company experienced ongoing content production disruptions due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including delays and, in some cases, cancellations of theatrical releases. These disruptions are explicitly referenced in both the Risk Factors and the Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) sections of the filing. In response, Disney announced leadership changes and a pending organizational restructuring aimed at addressing operational challenges, including those affecting the DMED segment. The restructuring could involve changes to the company\u2019s distribution approach and the platforms selected for initial content distribution, as a direct strategic response to the ongoing disruptions in content production and availability.",

This establishes a multi-hop connection between operational challenges and strategic decisions."

Risk Factors\n\nFor an enterprise as large and complex as the Company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in our filings with the SEC, the most significant factors affecting our business include the following:\n\n## BUSINESS, ECONOMIC, MARKET and OPERATING CONDITION RISKS\n\n## The adverse impact of COVID-19 on our businesses will continue for an unknown length of time and may continue to impact certain of our key sources of revenue.\n\nSince early 2020, the world has been and continues to be impacted by COVID-19 and its variants. COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread have impacted our segments in a number of ways, most significantly at DPEP where our theme parks and resorts were closed and cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended. In addition, at DMED we delayed, or in some cases, shortened or canceled theatrical releases and experienced disruptions in the production and availability of content. Collectively, our impacted businesses have historically been the source of the majority of our revenue. Operations have resumed at various points since May 2020, with certain theme parks and resort operations and film and television productions resuming by the end of fiscal 2020 and throughout 2021. Although operations resumed, many of our businesses continue to experience impacts from COVID-19, such as incremental health and safety measures and related increased expenses, capacity restrictions and closures (including at some of our international parks and in theaters in certain markets), and disruptions of content production activities.\n\nCOVID-19 impacts and future health outbreaks and pandemics could hasten the erosion of historical sources of revenue at our Linear Networks businesses and change consumer preferences. For example, COVID-19 impacts have changed, and may continue to change, consumer behavior and consumption patterns, such as theater-going to watch movies. Some industries in which our customers operate, such as theatrical distribution, retail and travel, have experienced, and could continue to experience, contraction and financial distress, which could impact the profitability of our businesses going forward.\n\nOur mitigation efforts in response to the impacts of COVID-19 on our businesses have had, or may continue to have, negative impacts. For example, in response to COVID-19 impacts, we incurred significant additional indebtedness and delayed or suspended certain projects in which we have invested, particularly at our parks and resorts and studio operations. In addition, we may take mitigation actions in the future to respond to the impacts of COVID-19 or other health outbreaks or pandemics on our businesses, such as raising additional financing; not declaring future dividends; further suspending or reducing capital spending; reducing film and television content investments; implementing furloughs or reductions in force or modifying our operating strategy. These and other of our mitigating actions may have an adverse impact on our businesses. Additionally, there are limitations on our ability to mitigate the adverse financial impact of COVID-19 and other health outbreaks or pandemics, including the fixed costs of our theme park business and the impact such events may have on capital markets and our cost of borrowing.\n\nGeographic variation in government requirements and ongoing changes to restrictions have disrupted and could further disrupt our businesses, including our production operations. Our operations could be suspended, re-suspended or subjected to new or reinstated limitations by government action or otherwise in the future as a result of developments related to COVID-19, such as the expansion of the Omicron subvariants or other variants, and other future health outbreaks and pandemics. For example, our international parks have reopened and closed multiple times since the onset of COVID-19. Some of our employees who returned to work were later refurloughed. Our operations could be further negatively impacted and our reputation could be negatively impacted by a significant COVID-19 or other health outbreak impacting our employees, customers or others interacting with our businesses, including our supply chain.\n\nThe impacts of COVID-19 to our business have generally amplified, or reduced our ability to mitigate, the other risks discussed in our filings with the SEC and our remediation efforts may not be successful.\n\nCOVID-19 also makes it more challenging for management to estimate future performance of our businesses. COVID-19 has already adversely impacted our businesses and net cash flow, and we expect the ultimate magnitude of these disruptions on our financial and operational results will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue which will, in turn, depend on the currently unknowable duration and severity of the impacts of COVID-19, and among other things, the impact and duration of governmental actions imposed in response to COVID-19 and individuals' and companies' risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward.\n\n## Changes in U.S., global, and regional economic conditions are expected to have an adverse effect on the profitability of our businesses.\n\nA decline in economic conditions, such as recession, economic downturn, and/or inflationary conditions in the U.S. and other regions of the world in which we do business can adversely affect demand and/or expenses for any of our businesses, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. Past declines in economic conditions reduced spending at our parks and resorts, purchases",

It includes the following sections:\n\n- Significant Developments\n- Consolidated Results and Non-Segment Items\n- Business Segment Results\n- Corporate and Unallocated Shared Expenses\n- Restructuring Activities\n- Liquidity and Capital Resources\n- Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information\n- Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nIn Item 7, we discuss fiscal 2022 and 2021 results and comparisons of fiscal 2022 results to fiscal 2021 results. Discussions of fiscal 2020 results and comparisons of fiscal 2021 results to fiscal 2020 results can be found in 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2021.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS\n\n## Leadership Change and Pending Restructuring\n\nAs previously announced, on November 20, 2022, Robert A. Iger returned to the Company as Chief Executive Officer ('CEO') and a director. Mr. Iger previously spent more than four decades at the Company, including 15 years as CEO. In announcing Mr. Iger's appointment, the Company noted he has agreed to serve as CEO for two years, with a mandate from the Company's Board of Directors 'to set the strategic direction for renewed growth and to work closely with the Board in developing a successor to lead the Company at the completion of his term.' Mr. Iger succeeded Robert A. Chapek, who had served as CEO since 2020.\n\nAs contemplated by the leadership change announcement, we anticipate that within the coming months Mr. Iger will initiate organizational and operating changes within the Company to address the Board's goals. While the plans are in early stages, changes in our structure and operations, including within DMED (and including possibly our distribution approach and the businesses/distribution platforms selected for the initial distribution of content), can be expected. The restructuring and change in business strategy, once determined, could result in impairment charges.\n\n## COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nSince early 2020, the world has been, and continues to be, impacted by COVID-19 and its variants. COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread have impacted our segments in a number of ways, most significantly at DPEP where our theme parks and resorts were closed and cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended. In addition, at DMED we delayed, or in some cases, shortened or cancelled theatrical releases and experienced disruptions in the production and availability of content. Operations have resumed at various points since May 2020, with certain theme park and resort operations and film and television productions resuming by the end of fiscal 2020 and throughout fiscal 2021. Although operations resumed, many of our businesses continue to experience impacts from COVID-19, such as incremental health and safety measures and related increased expenses, capacity restrictions and closures (including at some of our international parks and in theaters in certain markets), and disruption of content production activities.\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 related disruptions on our financial and operational results will be dictated by the currently unknowable duration and severity of COVID-19 and its variants, and among other things, governmental actions imposed in response to COVID-19 and individuals' and companies' risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to address government regulations and the safety of our employees, guests and talent.\n\nAdditionally, see Part I., Item 1A. Risk Factors - The adverse impact of COVID-19 on our businesses will continue for an unknown length of time and may continue to impact certain of our key sources of revenue.\n\n## CONSOLIDATED RESULTS AND NON-SEGMENT ITEMS\n\nRevenues for fiscal 2022 increased 23%, or $15.3 billion, to $82.7 billion; net income attributable to Disney increased $1.2 billion, to income of $3.1 billion; and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Disney increased to income of $1.75 compared to income of $1.11 in the prior year. The EPS increase was due to higher segment",

      "question": "Given the impact of declining linear viewership on advertising revenue and the costs associated with expanding DTC offerings, how does Disney's shift toward DTC products risk increasing financial losses, considering the specific challenges in content allocation costs and the expected forgone revenue from traditional sources?",
      "answer": "Disney's shift toward DTC products risks increasing financial losses due to two interconnected challenges: the decline in advertising revenue from linear viewership and the rising content allocation costs tied to DTC offerings. As linear viewership declines, advertising revenue decreases, reducing a key revenue stream. Simultaneously, Disney expects to forgo revenue from traditional sources as it expands its DTC offerings. Additionally, declines in traditional distribution channels may increase the cost of content allocable to DTC offerings, further negatively impacting profitability. These combined pressures\u2014reduced traditional revenue and higher DTC content costs\u2014create a financial risk that could amplify the significant losses already experienced in Disney\u2019s DTC businesses.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Declines in linear viewership have resulted in decreased advertising revenue, impacting traditional revenue streams.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Disney expects to forgo revenue from traditional sources as it expands its DTC offerings, and declines in traditional distribution may increase the cost of content allocable to DTC offerings.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The reduction in advertising revenue from declining linear viewership (from evidence_source_a) compounds the financial risk of forgone traditional revenue and rising content costs for DTC products (from evidence_source_b), increasing the likelihood of greater financial losses."

The current decline in economic conditions could also reduce attendance at our parks and resorts, prices that MVPDs pay for our cable programming, purchases of and prices for advertising on our DTC products or subscription levels for our cable programming or DTC products, while also increasing the prices we pay for goods, services and labor. Economic conditions can also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. In addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector such as current inflation in the domestic and global energy sector and other pronounced price increases generally and in certain other sectors, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and consumer products we offer, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs. A decline in economic conditions could impact implementation of our business plans, such as our plans to realign our cost structure and for the new DTC ad-supported service, pricing structure and price increases. In addition, actions to reduce inflation, including raising interest rates, increase our cost of borrowing, which in turn could make it more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or investments on favorable terms. Further, global economic conditions may impact foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. The current or continued strength in the value of the U.S. dollar has adversely impacted the U.S. dollar value of revenue we receive and expect to receive from other markets and may reduce international demand for our products and services. A decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar may increase our labor, supply or other costs in non-U.S. markets. Although we hedge exposure to certain foreign currency fluctuations, any such hedging activity may not substantially offset the negative financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and is not expected to offset all such negative financial impact, particularly in periods of sustained U.S. dollar strength relative to multiple foreign currencies. Further, economic or political conditions in countries outside the U.S. also have reduced, and could continue to reduce, our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in those countries or our ability to repatriate revenue from those countries. Broader supply chain delays, such as those currently impacting global distribution may further exacerbate current inflationary pressures and impact our ability to sell and deliver goods or otherwise disrupt our operations. The adverse impact on our businesses of the decline in economic conditions will depend, in part, on its severity and duration and our ability to mitigate the impacts of this decline on our businesses will be limited.\n\n## Changes in technology and in consumer consumption patterns may affect demand for our entertainment products, the revenue we can generate from these products or the cost of producing or distributing products.\n\nThe media entertainment and internet businesses in which we participate increasingly depend on our ability to successfully adapt to shifting patterns of content consumption through the adoption and exploitation of new technologies. New technologies affect the demand for our products, the manner in which our products are distributed to consumers, ways we charge for and receive revenue for our entertainment products and the stability of those revenue streams, the sources and nature of competing content offerings, the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired audiences. This trend has impacted the business model for certain traditional forms of distribution, as evidenced by the industry-wide decline in ratings for broadcast television, the reduction in demand for home entertainment sales of theatrical content, the development of alternative distribution channels for broadcast and cable programming and declines in subscriber levels for traditional cable channels, including for a number of our networks. In addition, theater-going to watch movies currently is, and may continue to be, below pre-COVID-19 levels. Declines in linear viewership have resulted in decreased advertising revenue. In order to respond to these developments, we regularly consider, and from time to time implement changes to our business models, most recently by developing, investing in and acquiring DTC products, initiating plans to again reorganize our media and entertainment businesses to advance our DTC strategies, and developing next generation storytelling offerings. There can be no assurance that our DTC offerings, next generation storytelling offerings and other efforts will successfully respond to these changes. In addition, declines in certain traditional forms of distribution may increase the cost of content allocable to our DTC offerings, negatively impacting the profitability of our DTC offerings. We expect to forgo revenue from traditional sources, particularly as we expand our DTC offerings. To date we have experienced significant losses in our DTC businesses. There can be no assurance that the DTC model and other business models we may develop will ultimately be profitable or as profitable as our existing or historic business models.\n\n## Misalignment with public and consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment, travel and consumer products could negatively impact demand for our entertainment offerings and products and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses.\n\nOur businesses create entertainment, travel and consumer products whose success depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently create compelling content, which may be distributed, among other ways, through broadcast, cable, internet or cellular technology, theme park attractions, hotels and other resort facilities and travel experiences and consumer products. Such distribution must meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market and respond to competition from an expanding array of choices facilitated by technological developments in the delivery of content. The success of our theme parks, resorts, cruise ships and experiences, as well as our theatrical releases, depends on demand for public or out-of-home",

      "question": "How did the continuation of capacity restrictions related to COVID-19 in fiscal 2022 impact Disney's consolidated revenue growth compared to the prior year, and what was the associated financial effect of prior-year goodwill impairments tied to these restrictions?",
      "answer": "The continuation of capacity restrictions in fiscal 2022, particularly affecting Disney's international parks and theatrical operations, contributed to ongoing financial disruption. Despite these challenges, Disney reported a 23% increase in revenues to $82.7 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to the prior year. However, the prior-year fiscal 2020 results included a $5.0 billion goodwill and intangible asset impairment, partially driven by the impact of capacity restrictions and closures on the International Channels business. This impairment had a lasting effect on Disney's financial position, although it did not directly impact the 23% year-over-year revenue growth in fiscal 2022.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The document notes that Disney recorded $5.0 billion in goodwill and intangible asset impairments in fiscal 2020, partly due to the impact of capacity restrictions on the International Channels business.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The document states that fiscal 2022 revenues increased by 23%, or $15.3 billion, to $82.7 billion, despite ongoing impacts from capacity restrictions and closures related to the pandemic.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While fiscal 2022 showed strong revenue growth, the impairments from fiscal 2020 highlight the long-term financial effects of the capacity restrictions, particularly on international operations, which continued to face challenges in 2022."

COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread have impacted our segments in a number of ways, most significantly at DPEP where our theme parks and resorts were closed and cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended. In addition, at DMED we delayed, or in some cases, shortened or cancelled theatrical releases and experienced disruptions in the production and availability of content. Operations have resumed at various points since May 2020, with certain theme park and resort operations and film and television productions resuming by the end of fiscal 2020 and throughout fiscal 2021. Although operations resumed, many of our businesses continue to experience impacts from COVID-19, such as incremental health and safety measures and related increased expenses, capacity restrictions and closures (including at some of our international parks and in theaters in certain markets), and disruption of content production activities.\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 related disruptions on our financial and operating results will be dictated by the currently unknowable duration and severity of COVID-19 and its variants, and among other things, governmental actions imposed in response to COVID-19 and individuals' and companies' risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to address government regulations and the safety of our employees, guests and talent.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, the Company recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairments totaling $5.0 billion, in part due to the negative impact COVID-19 has had on the International Channels business (see Note 18).\n\n## DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS\n\n## Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution\n\nDMED encompasses the Company's global film and episodic television content production and distribution activities. Content is distributed by a single organization across three significant lines of business: Linear Networks, Direct-toConsumer and Content Sales/Licensing. Content is generally created/licensed by four groups: Studios, General Entertainment, Sports and International. The distribution organization has full accountability for the financial results of the entire media and entertainment business.\n\nThe operations of DMED's significant lines of business are as follows:\n\n- Linear Networks\n- Domestic Channels: ABC Television Network and eight owned ABC television stations (Broadcasting), and Disney, ESPN (80% interest), Freeform, FX and National Geographic (73% interest) branded domestic television networks (Cable)\n- International Channels: Disney, ESPN, Fox, National Geographic and Star branded television networks outside the U.S.\n- A 50% equity investment in A+E Television Networks (A+E), which operates a variety of cable channels including A&amp;E, HISTORY and Lifetime\n- Direct-to-Consumer\n- Disney+, Disney+ Hotstar, ESPN+ (68% effective interest), Hulu and Star+ direct-to-consumer (DTC) video streaming services\n- Content Sales/Licensing\n- Sale/licensing of film and television content to third-party television and subscription/advertising video-on-demand (TV/SVOD) services\n- Theatrical distribution\n- Home entertainment distribution (DVD, Blu-ray discs and electronic home video licenses)\n- Music distribution",

It includes the following sections:\n\n- Significant Developments\n- Consolidated Results and Non-Segment Items\n- Business Segment Results\n- Corporate and Unallocated Shared Expenses\n- Restructuring Activities\n- Liquidity and Capital Resources\n- Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information\n- Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nIn Item 7, we discuss fiscal 2022 and 2021 results and comparisons of fiscal 2022 results to fiscal 2021 results. Discussions of fiscal 2020 results and comparisons of fiscal 2021 results to fiscal 2020 results can be found in 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2021.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS\n\n## Leadership Change and Pending Restructuring\n\nAs previously announced, on November 20, 2022, Robert A. Iger returned to the Company as Chief Executive Officer ('CEO') and a director. Mr. Iger previously spent more than four decades at the Company, including 15 years as CEO. In announcing Mr. Iger's appointment, the Company noted he has agreed to serve as CEO for two years, with a mandate from the Company's Board of Directors 'to set the strategic direction for renewed growth and to work closely with the Board in developing a successor to lead the Company at the completion of his term.' Mr. Iger succeeded Robert A. Chapek, who had served as CEO since 2020.\n\nAs contemplated by the leadership change announcement, we anticipate that within the coming months Mr. Iger will initiate organizational and operating changes within the Company to address the Board's goals. While the plans are in early stages, changes in our structure and operations, including within DMED (and including possibly our distribution approach and the businesses/distribution platforms selected for the initial distribution of content), can be expected. The restructuring and change in business strategy, once determined, could result in impairment charges.\n\n## COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nSince early 2020, the world has been, and continues to be, impacted by COVID-19 and its variants. COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread have impacted our segments in a number of ways, most significantly at DPEP where our theme parks and resorts were closed and cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended.

Although operations resumed, many of our businesses continue to experience impacts from COVID-19, such as incremental health and safety measures and related increased expenses, capacity restrictions and closures (including at some of our international parks and in theaters in certain markets), and disruption of content production activities.\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 related disruptions on our financial and operational results will be dictated by the currently unknowable duration and severity of COVID-19 and its variants, and among other things, governmental actions imposed in response to COVID-19 and individuals' and companies' risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to address government regulations and the safety of our employees, guests and talent.\n\nAdditionally, see Part I., Item 1A. Risk Factors - The adverse impact of COVID-19 on our businesses will continue for an unknown length of time and may continue to impact certain of our key sources of revenue.\n\n## CONSOLIDATED RESULTS AND NON-SEGMENT ITEMS\n\nRevenues for fiscal 2022 increased 23%, or $15.3 billion, to $82.7 billion; net income attributable to Disney increased $1.2 billion, to income of $3.1 billion; and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Disney increased to income of $1.75 compared to income of $1.11 in the prior year.

The Telco Class A-4 interests will pay an initial preferred distribution of 5.94% annually, subject to declaration, and subject to reset on November 1, 2028, and every four years thereafter. The Telco Class A-4 interests can be called at issue price beginning on November 1, 2028, and are subject to the same redemption and liquidation rights as the Telco Class A-1, A-2 and A-3 interests. Upon the expected issuance in the first quarter of 2025, we intend to use the Telco Class A-4 proceeds to fund the redemption of preferred equity securities.\n\n## Mobility II Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\n\nIn June 2023, we issued two million Series B Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Membership Interests in Mobility II LLC (Mobility noncontrolling interests), which pay cash distributions of 6.8% per annum, subject to declaration.

The Mobility noncontrolling interests are considered Level 3 under the Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures framework (see Note 12) and included in 'Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest' on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nA holder of the Mobility noncontrolling interests may put the interests to Mobility II on or after the earliest of certain events or each June 15 and December 15, beginning on June 15, 2028. Mobility II may redeem the interests on each March 15 and September 15, beginning on March 15, 2028. The price at which a put option or a redemption option can be exercised is the sum of (a) $1,000 per Mobility noncontrolling interest plus (b) any accrued and unpaid distributions. The redemption price must be paid in cash.\n\n## NOTE 17. SALES OF RECEIVABLES\n\nWe have agreements with various third-party financial institutions pertaining to the sales of certain types of our accounts receivable. The most significant of these programs are discussed in detail below and generally consist of (1) receivables arising from equipment installment plans, which are sold for cash and beneficial interests, such as deferred purchase price, when applicable, and (2) revolving trade receivables, which are sold for cash. Under the terms of our agreements for these programs, we continue to service the transferred receivables on behalf of the financial institutions.\n\nThe following table sets forth a summary of cash proceeds received, net of remittances paid, from sales of receivables for the years ended December 31:\n\n",

      "answer": "The book value of AT&T's investment in DIRECTV dropped from $877 million at December 31, 2023, to $0 at December 31, 2024, a decrease of $877 million. This reduction reflects the cumulative cash receipts from DIRECTV exceeding AT&T's initial investment balance plus its cumulative equity in DIRECTV earnings, which led to the investment being reduced to zero on the consolidated balance sheet beginning in Q3 2024. In comparison, AT&T's deconsolidation of Gigapower occurred earlier, on May 12, 2023, after acquiring a 50% interest in the joint venture through a transaction with BlackRock. Both events reflect changes in AT&T's equity investments, but the DIRECTV investment was fully liquidated by the end of 2024, whereas Gigapower continues to be accounted for as an equity method investment.",

        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, understand that the investment in DIRECTV was reduced to zero beginning in Q3 2024 due to cash receipts exceeding the investment balance and cumulative equity earnings.",

        "Step 4: Compare the two events: Gigapower was deconsolidated in mid-2023 and continues as an equity method investment, while DIRECTV\u2019s investment value was reduced to zero by year-end 2024 as a result of excess cash distributions."

We expect a gain on sale, whose amount will be dependent on the timing of close.\n\nBeginning in third-quarter 2024, our investment in DIRECTV was reduced to zero on our consolidated balance sheet, resulting from aggregate cash receipts exceeding our initial investment balance plus our cumulative equity in DIRECTV earnings. As we are not committed, implicitly or explicitly, to provide financial or other support to DIRECTV, we record cash distributions received in excess of our share of DIRECTV's earnings in 'Equity in net income of affiliates' in the consolidated statements of income and as cash provided by operations in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $2,027, $1,666 and $1,808 of equity in net income of affiliates and received total distributions of $2,955, $3,715 and $4,457, respectively, from DIRECTV. The book value of our investment in DIRECTV was $0 and $877 at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nOur share of net income or loss may differ from the stated ownership percentage interest of DIRECTV as the terms of the arrangement prescribe substantive nonproportionate cash distributions, both from operations and in liquidation, that are based on classes of interests held by investors. In the event that DIRECTV records a loss, that loss will be allocated to ownership interests based on their seniority, beginning with the most subordinated interests.\n\nGigapower On May 11, 2023, we closed our transaction with BlackRock, through a fund managed by its Diversified Infrastructure business, related to Gigapower, LLC (Gigapower). We hold a 50% interest in this joint venture, which provides a fiber network in select areas to internet service providers and other businesses across the U.S. We deconsolidated Gigapower's operations and began accounting for it as an equity method investment on May 12, 2023.\n\nSKY Mexico In June 2024, we sold our 41.3% interest in SKY Mexico, a leading pay-TV provider in Mexico.\n\nThe following table presents summarized financial information for DIRECTV and our other equity method investments, consisting primarily of Gigapower, SKY Mexico (prior to disposition) and certain sports-related programming investments, at December 31, or for the year then ended:\n\n",

The difference between the carrying value of the Mobility preferred interest, which represented fair value at contribution, and the fair value of the instrument upon settlement and/or balance sheet reclassification was recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 213 million Mobility preferred interests outstanding, which had a redemption value of approximately $5,340 and paid cash distributions of $373 per annum, subject to declaration. In April 2023, we accepted the December 2022 put option notice from the AT&amp;T pension trust and repurchased the remaining 213 million Mobility preferred interests for a purchase price, including accrued and unpaid distributions, of $5,414.\n\n## Tower Holdings Preferred Interests\n\nIn 2019, we issued $6,000 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests in a wireless subsidiary (Tower Holdings) that holds interests in various tower assets and have the right to receive approximately $6,000 if the purchase options from the tower companies are exercised.\n\nThe membership interests in Tower Holdings consist of (1) common interests, which are held by a consolidated subsidiary of AT&amp;T, and (2) two series of preferred interests (collectively the '2019 Tower preferred interests'). The 2019 Tower preferred interests were subject to reset in December 2024 and included a September series (Tower Class A-1) totaling $1,500 that paid an initial preferred distribution of 5.0%, and a December series (Tower Class A-2) totaling $4,500 that paid an initial preferred distribution of 4.75%.\n\nIn August 2024, we amended the 2019 Tower preferred interests, effective November 2024, to reset the rate and restructure the membership interests whereby all of the 2019 Tower preferred interests are now designated Fixed Rate Class A Limited Membership Interests (Tower Fixed Rate Interests). A portion of the Tower Fixed Rate Interests will move to Floating Rate Class A Limited Membership Interests (Tower Floating Rate Interests) each year over a five-year period. The Tower Fixed Rate Interests pay a preferred distribution of 5.90%, and the Tower Floating Rate Interests, which could equal $525 by 2028 if not called prior, pay a preferred distribution equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus 250 basis points, as defined in the agreement. Distributions are paid quarterly, subject to declaration, and reset every five years. Any failure to declare or pay distributions on the Tower Fix ed Rate Interests or Tower Floating Rate Interests (collectively, the 'Tower preferred interests') would not impose any limitation on cash movements between affiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&amp;T shares. We can call the Tower preferred interests at the issue price beginning in November 2029, and we can call the Tower Floating Rate Interests at any time. The Tower preferred interests are included in 'Noncontrolling interest' on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe holders of the Tower preferred interests have the option to require redemption upon the occurrence of certain contingent events, such as the failure of AT&amp;T to pay the preferred distribution for two or more periods or to meet certain other requirements, including a minimum credit rating. If notice is given upon such an event, all other holders of equal or more subordinate classes of membership interests in Tower Holdings are entitled to receive the same form of consideration payable to the holders of the preferred interests, resulting in a deemed liquidation for accounting purposes.\n\n## Telco LLC Preferred Interests\n\nIn September 2020, we issued $2,000 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests (Telco Class A-1) out of a newly created limited liability company (Telco LLC) that was formed to hold telecommunications-related assets. In April 2023, we expanded our September 2020 transaction and issued an additional $5,250 of nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests (Telco Class A-2 and A-3). As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, cumulative preferred interests in our Telco LLC totaled $7,250 (collectively the 'Telco preferred interests').\n\nMembers' equity in Telco LLC consists of (1) members' interests, which are held by a consolidated subsidiary of AT&amp;T, (2) Telco Class A-1 preferred interests, which pay an initial preferred distribution of 4.25% annually, subject to declaration, and subject to reset every seven years, and (3) Telco Class A-2 and A-3 preferred interests, which pay an initial preferred distribution of 6.85% annually, subject to declaration, and subject to reset on November 1, 2027, and every seven years thereafter. Failure to pay distributions on the Telco preferred interests would not limit cash movements between affiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&amp;T shares. We can call the Telco preferred interests at the issue price beginning seven years from the issuance date. The Telco preferred interests are included in 'Noncontrolling interest' on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe holders of the Telco preferred interests have the option to require redemption upon the occurrence of certain contingent events, such as the failure of Telco LLC to pay the preferred distribution for two or more periods or to meet certain other requirements, including a minimum credit rating.

The time-based vesting agreements (listed in exhibits 10.43, 10.49, and 10.54) provide a standard approach where equity compensation vests over time, typically helping retain talent. In contrast, Disney employs at least six distinct forms of performance-based Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreements (listed in exhibits 10.44-10.48, 10.55, 10.57-10.59) that tie vesting to metrics like Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and Return on Invested Capital (ROIC), ensuring executive compensation is more directly aligned with company performance and shareholder value creation.",

This significant ownership stake influences Disney's direct-to-consumer platform offerings by providing National Geographic-branded programming on Disney+, one of Disney's major DTC services, enhancing its content library with educational and documentary content.",
