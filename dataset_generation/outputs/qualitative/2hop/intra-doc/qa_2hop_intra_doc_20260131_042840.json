At December 31, 2021, the company's carrying value of its investment in TCO was about $100 higher than the amount of underlying equity in TCO's net assets. This difference results from Chevron acquiring a portion of its interest in TCO at a value greater than the underlying book value for that portion of TCO's net assets. Included in the investment is a loan to TCO to fund the development of the FGP/WPMP with a balance of $4,500.\n\nPetropiar Chevron has a 30 percent interest in Petropiar, a joint stock company which operates the heavy oil Huyapari Field and upgrading project in Venezuela's Orinoco Belt. In 2020, the company fully impaired its investments in the Petropiar affiliate and, effective July 1, 2020, began accounting for this venture as a non-equity method investment.\n\nPetroboscan Chevron  has  a  39.2  percent  interest  in  Petroboscan,  a  joint  stock  company  which  operates  the  Boscan  Field  in Venezuela.  In  2020,  the  company  fully  impaired  its  investments  in  the  Petroboscan  affiliate  and,  effective  July  1,  2020,  began accounting  for  this  venture  as  a  non-equity  method  investment.  The  company  also  has  an  outstanding  long-term  loan  to Petroboscan of $560, which has been fully provisioned for at year-end 2021.\n\nCaspian Pipeline Consortium Chevron has a 15 percent interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which provides the critical export route for crude oil from both TCO and Karachaganak.\n\nAngola  LNG Limited Chevron  has  a  36.4  percent  interest  in Angola  LNG  Limited,  which  processes  and  liquefies  natural  gas produced in Angola for delivery to international markets.\n\nChevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC Chevron owns 50 percent of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC. The other half is owned by Phillips 66.\n\nGS Caltex Corporation Chevron owns 50 percent of GS Caltex Corporation, a joint venture with GS Energy in South Korea.

      "answer": "Chevron's acquisition of Noble added production capacity measured in oil-equivalent barrels, where 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas equals 1 barrel of crude oil. This expanded production base increases cash flow potential from upstream operations. Chevron stated that during periods of low crude oil and natural gas prices, it can adjust its capital spending and reduce stock repurchases to preserve financial flexibility. Given that Chevron's debt is rated AA- by S&P and Aa2 by Moody\u2019s\u2014indicating strong creditworthiness\u2014the additional production from Noble enhances Chevron\u2019s ability to generate cash and maintain its investment-grade credit profile, even in challenging market conditions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_b - Chevron acquired Noble in October 2020, which contributed to its upstream production capacity, using the oil-equivalent conversion ratio of 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas = 1 barrel of crude oil.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - Chevron has high-quality debt ratings: AA- by S&P and Aa2 by Moody\u2019s, and the company emphasizes its ability to adjust capital spending and repurchases during low-price periods to preserve its debt ratings.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The Noble acquisition boosts Chevron's production and thus potential cash flow, which supports Chevron\u2019s ability to maintain high-quality debt ratings by providing more financial cushion during commodity price downturns."

At December 31, 2021, the company's carrying value of its investment in TCO was about $100 higher than the amount of underlying equity in TCO's net assets. This difference results from Chevron acquiring a portion of its interest in TCO at a value greater than the underlying book value for that portion of TCO's net assets. Included in the investment is a loan to TCO to fund the development of the FGP/WPMP with a balance of $4,500.\n\nPetropiar Chevron has a 30 percent interest in Petropiar, a joint stock company which operates the heavy oil Huyapari Field and upgrading project in Venezuela's Orinoco Belt. In 2020, the company fully impaired its investments in the Petropiar affiliate and, effective July 1, 2020, began accounting for this venture as a non-equity method investment.\n\nPetroboscan Chevron  has  a  39.2  percent  interest  in  Petroboscan,  a  joint  stock  company  which  operates  the  Boscan  Field  in Venezuela.  In  2020,  the  company  fully  impaired  its  investments  in  the  Petroboscan  affiliate  and,  effective  July  1,  2020,  began accounting  for  this  venture  as  a  non-equity  method  investment.  The  company  also  has  an  outstanding  long-term  loan  to Petroboscan of $560, which has been fully provisioned for at year-end 2021.\n\nCaspian Pipeline Consortium Chevron has a 15 percent interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which provides the critical export route for crude oil from both TCO and Karachaganak.\n\nAngola  LNG Limited Chevron  has  a  36.4  percent  interest  in Angola  LNG  Limited,  which  processes  and  liquefies  natural  gas produced in Angola for delivery to international markets.\n\nChevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC Chevron owns 50 percent of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC.

      "answer": "Chevron evaluates the pace of the energy transition as a key factor in its commodity price forecasting and asset impairment assessments. Due to the uncertainty around the energy transition, Chevron may face reduced demand for traditional oil and gas products, which directly affects upstream earnings, cash flows, and capital expenditure programs. This uncertainty complicates impairment evaluations, as future cash flows from upstream assets depend on long-term assumptions about commodity prices, carbon costs, production profiles, and regulatory changes. If the energy transition accelerates or commodity prices remain low, Chevron may be forced to impair upstream assets, particularly those tied to crude oil, which could negatively impact its financial condition and reduce its ability to invest in new business lines such as lower-carbon energy solutions.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Chevron identifies the pace of energy transition as a key variable affecting crude oil prices and upstream investment decisions.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Chevron conducts impairment assessments based on assumptions including the pace of energy transition, future commodity prices, and regulatory changes.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The uncertainty around the energy transition impacts Chevron\u2019s upstream investment planning and increases the risk of asset impairments due to potential declines in future cash flows from oil and gas assets."

Risk Factors\n\nAs a global energy company, Chevron is subject to a variety of risks that could materially impact the company's results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## BUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL RISK FACTORS\n\nImpacts of the continuation or further resurgences of the COVID-19 pandemic may have an adverse and potentially material adverse effect on Chevron's financial and operating results The economic, business, and oil and gas industry impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic  and  the  disruption  to  capital  markets  have  been  and  continue  to  be  far  reaching.  While  the  oil  and  gas industry  witnessed  a  substantial  recovery  of  commodity  prices  and  demand  for  products  during  2021,  there  continues  to  be uncertainty  and  unpredictability  about  the  impact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  on  our  financial  and  operating  results  in  future periods. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacts our future financial and operating results, and for what duration and magnitude, depends on several factors that are continuing to evolve, are difficult to predict and, in many instances, are beyond the company's control. Such factors include the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any further resurgences of the COVID-19 virus and its variants, and the impact on our workforce and operations; the negative impact of the pandemic on the economy  and  economic  activity,  including  travel  restrictions  and  prolonged  low  demand  for  our  products;  the  ability  of  our affiliates, suppliers and partners to successfully navigate the impacts of the pandemic; the actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic; the actions of OPEC and other countries that otherwise impact supply and demand and, correspondingly, commodity prices; the extent and duration of recovery of economies and demand for our products after the pandemic subsides; and Chevron's ability to keep its cost model in line with changing demand for our products.\n\nThe company's suppliers continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and access to materials, supplies, and contract labor has been strained. This strain on the financial health of the company's suppliers could put pressure on the company's financial results  and  may  negatively  impact  supply  assurance  and  supplier  performance.  In-country  conditions,  including  potential  future waves of the COVID-19 virus and its variants in countries that appear to have reduced their infection rates, could impact logistics and material movement and remain a risk to business continuity.\n\nIn light of the significant uncertainty around the duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, management is currently  unable  to  develop  with  any  level  of  confidence  estimates  and  assumptions  that  may  have  a  material  impact  on  the company's  consolidated  financial  statements  and  financial  or  operational  performance  in  any  given  period.  In  addition,  the unprecedented nature of such market conditions could cause current management estimates and assumptions to be challenged in hindsight.\n\nIn addition, the continuation or further resurgences of the pandemic could precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors identified in this Form 10-K, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and profitability, including in ways not currently known or considered by us to present significant risks.\n\nChevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices Chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility. The single largest variable that affects the company's results of operations is the price of crude oil, which can be influenced by general economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries or other producers, weather-related damage and disruptions due to other natural or human causes beyond our control (including without limitation due to the COVID19 pandemic), competing fuel prices, geopolitical risks, the pace of energy transition, and governmental regulations and policies regarding the development of oil and gas reserves. Chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as a core part of its business planning process. An investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices.\n\nExtended periods of low prices for crude oil can have a material adverse impact on the company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Among other things, the company's upstream earnings, cash flows, and capital and exploratory expenditure programs could be negatively affected, as could its production and proved reserves. Upstream assets may also become impaired. Downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales. A significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the company's credit  ratings,  potentially  increase  financing  costs  and  reduce  access  to  capital  markets. The  company  may  be  unable  to  realize anticipated  cost  savings,  expenditure  reductions  and  asset  sales  that  are  intended  to  compensate  for  such  downturns,  and  such downturns  may  also  slow  the  pace  and  scale  at  which  we  are  able  to  invest  in  new  business  lines  such  as  the  lower  carbon businesses associated with our Chevron New Energies",

          "chunk_text": "This Oil and Gas Reserves commentary should be read in conjunction with the Properties, Plant and Equipment section of Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, which includes a description of the 'successful efforts' method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activities.\n\nImpairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates The company assesses its properties, plant and equipment (PP&amp;E) for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value.\n\nDetermination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters, such as future commodity prices, operating expenses, carbon costs, production profiles, the pace of the energy transition, and the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined products. However,  the  impairment  reviews  and  calculations  are  based  on  assumptions  that  are  generally  consistent  with  the  company's business plans and long-term investment decisions. Refer also to the discussion of impairments of properties, plant and equipment in  Note  18  Properties,  Plant  and  Equipment  and  to  the  section  on  Properties,  Plant  and  Equipment  in  Note  1  Summary  of Significant Accounting Policies.\n\nThe company performs impairment assessments when triggering events arise to determine whether any write-down in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required. For example, when significant downward revisions to crude oil and natural gas reserves are  made for any single field or concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset remains recoverable.  Similarly,  a  significant  downward  revision  in  the  company's  crude  oil  or  natural  gas  price  outlook  would trigger impairment reviews for impacted upstream assets. In addition, impairments could occur due to changes in national, state or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas. Also,  if  the  expectation  of  sale  of  a  particular  asset  or  asset  group  in  any  period  has  been  deemed  more  likely  than  not,  an impairment  review  is  performed,  and  if  the  estimated  net  proceeds  exceed  the  carrying  value  of  the  asset  or  asset  group,  no impairment charge is required. Such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed. Assets that are not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a decision is made to sell such assets. That is, the assets would be impaired if they are classified as held-for-sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale, less costs to sell, are less than the assets' associated carrying values.\n\nInvestments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method, as well as investments in other securities of these equity investees, are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the company's carrying value.  When  this  occurs,  a  determination  must  be  made  as  to  whether  this  loss  is  other-than-temporary,  in  which  case  the investment is impaired. Because of the number of differing assumptions potentially affecting whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment, a sensitivity analysis is not practicable.\n\nA sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable, given the broad range of the company's PP&amp;E and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. That is, favorable changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods, whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to become impaired, or resulted in larger impacts on impaired assets.\n\nAsset Retirement Obligations In the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation (ARO), the company uses various assumptions  and  judgments,  including  such  factors  as  the  existence  of  a  legal  obligation,  estimated  amounts  and  timing  of settlements,  discount  and  inflation  rates,  and  the  expected  impact  of  advances  in  technology  and  process  improvements.  A sensitivity analysis of the ARO impact on earnings for 2021 is not practicable, given the broad range of the company's long-lived assets  and  the  number  of  assumptions  involved  in  the  estimates.  That  is,  favorable  changes  to  some  assumptions  would  have reduced  estimated  future  obligations,  thereby  lowering  accretion  expense  and  amortization  costs,  whereas  unfavorable  changes would  have  the  opposite  effect.  Refer  to  Note  25  Asset  Retirement  Obligations  for  additional  discussions  on  asset  retirement obligations.\n\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans includes information on the funded status of the company's pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; the components of pension and OPEB expense reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Income; and the related underlying assumptions.\n\nThe determination of pension plan expense and obligations is based on a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan",

      "answer": "The total depreciation, depletion, amortization, and impairments for the Lower 48 region in 2023 was $5,729 million. The net book value of proved and unproved properties in the Lower 48 region as of December 31, 2023, was $37,185 million. This means that the accumulated depreciation, depletion, and amortization for the Lower 48 region, which was $36,829 million, when added to the 2023 depreciation, depletion, amortization, and impairments of $5,729 million, results in a total accumulated value of $42,558 million.

      "answer": "The combined total of the 2022 discounted future net cash flows from the Lower 48 region for both consolidated operations and equity affiliates is $55,912 million, as equity affiliates contributed no discounted future net cash flows from the Lower 48. This is significantly higher than the 2022 depreciation, depletion, amortization, and impairments for the Lower 48, which amounted to $4,854 million. This indicates that the future cash flow potential of the Lower 48 region is much greater than the costs recognized during 2022.",

      "answer": "Equity Companies in Asia reported 1,503 million barrels of proved undeveloped reserves against 19 thousand net acres. This results in a reserves-to-acre ratio of approximately 79.1 million barrels per thousand acres. In comparison, XOM's consolidated subsidiaries in Asia reported 1,315 million barrels of proved undeveloped reserves against 640 thousand net acres, yielding a reserves-to-acre ratio of approximately 2.05 million barrels per thousand acres. This indicates that Equity Companies are significantly more efficient in terms of reserves per acre in Asia, suggesting a potentially higher development potential in the region.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, extract the net acreage for Equity Companies in Asia, which is 19 thousand acres.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, extract the proved undeveloped reserves for Equity Companies in Asia, which is 1,503 million barrels.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the reserves-to-acre ratio for Equity Companies: 1,503 million barrels / 19 thousand acres = ~79.1 million barrels per thousand acres.",
        "Step 4: From evidence_source_a, extract the net acreage for consolidated subsidiaries in Asia, which is 640 thousand acres.",

Incentive Program\n\nThe 2003 Incentive Program provides for grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock, and other forms of awards. Awards may be granted to eligible employees of the Company and those affiliates at least 50 percent owned by the Corporation. Outstanding awards are subject to certain forfeiture provisions contained in the program or award instrument. Options and SARs may be granted at prices not less than 100 percent of market value on the date of grant and have a maximum life of 10 years. The maximum number of shares of stock that may be issued under the 2003 Incentive Program is 220 million. Awards that are forfeited, ex pire, or are settled in cash do not count against this max imum limit. The 2003 Incentive Program does not have a specified term. New awards may be made until the available shares are depleted, unless the ExxonMobil Board of Directors terminates the plan early. At the end of 2024, remaining shares available for award under the 2003 Incentive Program were 47 million.\n\nRestricted  Stock  and  Restricted  Stock  U nits. Awards  of  restricted  (nonvested)  common  stock  units  granted  under  the  2003  Incentive  Program  totaled 10,393 thousand, 9,701 thousand, and 9,392 thousand in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Compensation expense for these awards is based on the price of the stock at the date of grant and is recognized in income over the requisite service period. Shares for these awards are issued to employees from treasury stock. The units that are settled in cash are recorded as liabilities, and their changes in fair value are recognized over the vesting period. During the applicable restricted periods, the shares and units may not be sold or transferred and are subject to forfeiture. The majority of the awards have graded vesting periods, with 50 percent of the shares and units in  each  award vesting after three years,  and  the  remaining 50  percent  vesting  after seven years.  Some management, professional, and technical participants will receive awards that vest in full after three years. Awards granted to a small number of senior ex ecutives have vesting periods of five years for 50 percent of the award and of 10 years for the remaining 50 percent of the award, except that for awards granted prior to 2020 the vesting of the 10-year portion of the award is delayed until retirement if later than 10 years.\n\nIn accordance with the terms of the merger agreement for the Pioneer acquisition, which closed on May 3, 2024, awards of Pioneer restricted stock units granted under the Pioneer Amended and Restated 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan (Pioneer L TIP) that did not vest as of immediately prior to the closing were cancelled and converted into awards of ExxonMobil restricted stock units based on the merger exchange ratio. The grant date for the converted Pioneer awards is considered to be the effective date of the acquisition for the purpose of calculating fair value. Compensation costs for the converted Pioneer awards is recognized in income over a period commensurate with the vesting schedule. Pioneer awards vest in three installments over a period of three years with approximately one third of the awards vesting each year. Shares for these awards are issued to employees from treasury stock. The units that are settled in cash are recorded as liabilities and their changes in fair value are recognized over the vesting period. The maximum term of the Pioneer awards is three years. As of the Pioneer acquisition closing on May 3, 2024, the maximum number of shares of stock that can be issued under the Pioneer L TIP was 9,458 thousand. At the end of 2024, remaining shares available for awards under the Pioneer LTIP were 9,362 thousand.\n\nThe following tables summarize information about restricted stock and restricted stock units for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "In the preceding reserves information, consolidated subsidiary and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation operates its business with the same view of equity company reserves as it has for reserves from consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nThe Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from  year  to  year  due  to  the  timing  of  individual  project  start-ups;  operational  outages;  reservoir  performance;  regulatory  changes;  the  impact  of  fiscal  and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; international trade patterns and relations; and other factors described in Item 1A.\n\nThe estimation of proved reserves, which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty, is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of reservoir and well performance. Furthermore, the Corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management toward the development of the reserves. Although the Corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, and significant changes in crude oil and natural gas price levels. In addition, proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the level of the Corporation's capital spending and also impact our partners' capacity to fund their share of joint projects.\n\n## B. Technologies Used in E stablishing Proved Reserves Additions in 2024\n\nAdditions to ExxonMobil's proved reserves in 2024 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological, engineering and production data, utilizing well-established technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results.\n\nData used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores, such as well logs, reservoir core samples, fluid samples, static and dynamic pressure information, production test data, and surveillance and performance information. The data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements, including high-quality 3-D and 4-D seismic data, calibrated with available well control information. The tools used to interpret the data included seismic processing software, reservoir modeling and simulation software, and data analysis packages.\n\nIn  some  circumstances,  where  appropriate  analog  reservoirs  were  available,  reservoir  parameters  from  these  analogs  were  used  to  increase  the  quality  of  and confidence in the reserves estimates.\n\n## C. Qualifications of Reserves Technical Oversight Group and Internal Controls over Proved Reserves\n\nExxonMobil  has  a  dedicated  G lobal  Reserves  and  Resources  group  that  provides  technical  oversight  and  is  separate  from  the  operating  organization.  Primary responsibilities  of  this  group  include  oversight  of  the  reserves  estimation  process  for  compliance  with  Securities  and  Ex change  Commission  (SEC)  rules  and regulations, review of annual changes in reserves estimates, and the reporting of ExxonMobil's proved reserves. This group also maintains the official company reserves estimates for ExxonMobil's proved reserves of crude oil, natural gas liquids, bitumen, synthetic oil, and natural gas. In addition, the group provides training to personnel involved in the reserves estimation and reporting process within ExxonMobil and its affiliates. The current G lobal Reserves and Resources Manager has more than 30 years of experience in reservoir engineering and reserves assessment, has a degree in Engineering, and serves on the Oil and G as Reserves Committee of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. The group is staffed with individuals that have an average of more than 15 years of technical experience in the petroleum industry, including expertise in the classification and categorization of reserves under SEC guidelines. This group includes individuals who hold degrees in either Engineering or Geology.\n\nThe  Global  Reserves  and  Resources  group  maintains  a  central  database  containing  the  official  company  reserves  estimates.  Appropriate  controls,  including limitations on database access and update capabilities, are in place to ensure data integrity within this central database. An annual review of the system's controls is performed by internal audit. Key components of the reserves estimation process include technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments, analysis of well and field performance, and long-standing approval guidelines. No changes may be made to the reserves estimates in the central database, including additions of any new initial reserves estimates or subsequent revisions, unless these changes have been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by duly authorized geoscience and engineering professionals within the operating organization. In addition, changes to reserves estimates that exceed certain thresholds require further review and approval by the appropriate level of management within the operating organization before the changes may be made in the central database. Endorsement by the Global Reserves and Resources group for all proved reserves changes is a mandatory component of this review process. After all changes are made, reviews are held with senior management for final endorsement.",

      "answer": "The total oil-equivalent volume of proved reserves from equity companies in Asia is 1,276 million barrels. This contributes to ExxonMobil's overall capital employed metric by reflecting ExxonMobil's net share in equity companies' assets, which the company includes to provide a more comprehensive measure of capital employed. The proved reserves from equity companies in Asia represent 86.2% of the total equity company proved reserves (1,276 out of 1,481 million barrels), indicating a significant concentration of reserves that factor into ExxonMobil's capital employed calculation.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_b - The total oil-equivalent volume of proved reserves from equity companies in Asia is 1,276 million barrels.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - ExxonMobil includes its share of equity companies' assets and liabilities in the capital employed metric to provide a more comprehensive view of its net investment.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The 1,276 million barrels in proved reserves from equity companies in Asia contribute to ExxonMobil's capital employed metric, as these reserves represent a significant portion (86.2%) of the total proved reserves from equity companies globally (1,481 million barrels)."

When viewed from the perspective of how the capital is used by the businesses, it includes ExxonMobil's net share of property, plant and equipment and other assets less liabilities, ex cluding both short-term and long-term debt. When viewed from the perspective of the sources of capital employed in total for the Corporation, it includes ExxonMobil's share of total debt and equity. Both of these views include ExxonMobil's share of amounts applicable to equity companies, which the Corporation believes should be included to provide a more comprehensive measure of capital employed.\n\n",

      "answer": "Chevron's use of derivative commodity instruments in 2023 had no material impact on its financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. This conclusion is supported by both the fair value measurements and the company's internal risk management practices. Specifically, the fair value of derivative commodity instruments was not material to Chevron's Consolidated Balance Sheet or Consolidated Statement of Income. Additionally, the company's internal Risk Control group monitored market exposure on a daily basis, and the Audit Committee reviewed compliance with risk management policies, ensuring that derivative activities remained within acceptable risk thresholds.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The company's derivatives are not material to its financial position, results of operations, or liquidity, and fair value remeasurements of financial instruments were not material at December 31, 2023.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Chevron's derivative commodity instruments' change in fair value in 2023 was not material to its results of operations, and its risk management practices are monitored daily by the Risk Control group and reviewed by the Audit Committee.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both chunks confirm that Chevron's derivative activities had no material financial impact in 2023 and that these activities were closely monitored through formal risk management practices, ensuring that any exposure remained within controlled limits."

      "question": "How does Chevron's investment in lower carbon technologies, as part of its energy transition strategy, potentially influence the impairment risk of its upstream oil and gas assets under changing commodity price outlooks?",
      "answer": "Chevron's investment in lower carbon technologies, such as hydrogen and carbon capture, supports its long-term strategy to reduce carbon intensity and diversify its business. However, if the pace of the energy transition accelerates and leads to a significant downward revision in Chevron's crude oil or natural gas price outlook, impairment reviews would be triggered for upstream assets. This could result in impairment charges if the future undiscounted cash flows from these assets no longer support their carrying value on the balance sheet.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Chevron is investing in new lower carbon businesses such as hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, and geothermal through its Chevron New Energies organization to reduce carbon intensity and become high-growth opportunities.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Chevron assesses properties, plant, and equipment for impairment when events such as significant downward revisions in crude oil, NGLs, or natural gas price outlooks occur, which would trigger impairment reviews for impacted upstream assets.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Chevron's investments in lower carbon technologies signal a strategic shift aligned with the energy transition. However, if this transition accelerates and commodity prices for oil and gas fall significantly, it would trigger impairment reviews. The company's upstream assets could become impaired if their carrying value exceeds expected future cash flows under a lower demand or price scenario driven by the energy transition."

Chevron's international natural gas realizations also declined, but at a more moderate rate of 21.1%, from $9.75 per MCF in 2022 to $7.69 per MCF in 2023.

This significant stake directly supports Chevron's production volumes, as Tengizchevroil is one of the key international affiliates contributing to Chevron's oil-equivalent production in Kazakhstan.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract Chevron's investment in Tengizchevroil from evidence_source_a: $27,368 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract Chevron's total equity method investments from evidence_source_a: $46,618 million.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the percentage of Chevron's Tengizchevroil investment relative to total equity method investments: $27,368 / $46,618 = ~58.7%.",
        "Step 4: Extract production-related information about Tengizchevroil from evidence_source_b: Chevron's production volumes include its share from affiliates like Tengizchevroil in Kazakhstan."

      "question": "What is the total expected range of CPChem-related capital expenditures in 2025, and how does this compare to the 2024 capital spending at Chevron's other major affiliates, such as Tengizchevroil?",
      "answer": "The total expected range of CPChem-related capital expenditures in 2025 is between $0.9 billion and $1.0 billion, assuming CPChem constitutes more than half of Chevron's projected Affiliate Capex range of $1.7 to $2.0 billion. This represents a significant increase compared to the reduced 2024 capital spending at Tengizchevroil, where Affiliate Capex dropped to $2.4 billion, 31% lower than 2023, primarily due to lower spend at the Wellhead Pressure Management Project (WPMP) and Future Growth Project (FGP).",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_b, Chevron's total Affiliate Capex for 2025 is expected to range between $1.7 to $2.0 billion, with CPChem's two major integrated polymer projects accounting for more than half of this amount.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, Chevron's Affiliate Capex in 2024 was $2.4 billion, which was 31% lower than 2023 due to reduced spending at Tengizchevroil's WPMP and FGP projects.",
        "Step 3: By calculating more than half of the 2025 Affiliate Capex range, we estimate CPChem\u2019s 2025 capital expenditures to be between $0.9 billion and $1.0 billion.",
        "Step 4: Comparing this to 2024, CPChem\u2019s expected 2025 investment represents a notable rebound in affiliate-level capital intensity compared to the declining trend seen at Tengizchevroil in 2024."

      "answer": "The maximum total duration of a petroleum retention license in Papua New Guinea is 15 years, which includes an initial 5-year term and up to two extensions at the Minister's discretion. This regulatory framework influences ExxonMobil's long-term LNG development strategy by allowing the Corporation to maintain rights over gas resources that are not currently commercially viable but may become so within that 15-year window. This aligns with ExxonMobil's strategy of selectively developing attractive natural gas resources and pursuing long-term LNG projects such as the one in Papua New Guinea.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_b, extract the specific regulatory detail: petroleum retention licenses in Papua New Guinea are granted for an initial 5-year term and may be extended twice at the Minister's discretion, with the total period of all extensions not exceeding 10 years, making the maximum possible retention time 15 years.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_a, extract ExxonMobil's strategic focus on LNG developments, including the specific mention of Papua New Guinea as one of the key LNG projects in their capital program.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the connection: The 15-year maximum duration of petroleum retention licenses provides ExxonMobil with a defined timeframe to assess and potentially develop LNG resources in Papua New Guinea, supporting their long-term investment planning and resource portfolio high-grading strategy."

          "chunk_text": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## BUSINESS RESULTS\n\n## Upstream\n\nExxonMobil  continues  to  sustain  a  diverse  growth  portfolio  of  exploration  and  development  opportunities,  which  enables  the Corporation to be selective, maximizing shareholder value and mitigating political and technical risks. ExxonMobil's fundamental strategies guide our global Upstream business, including capturing material and accretive opportunities to continually high-grade the  resource  portfolio,  selectively  developing  attractive  oil  and  natural  gas  resources,  developing  and  applying  high-impact technologies, and pursuing productivity and efficiency gains as well as a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. These strategies are underpinned by a relentless focus on operational excellence, development of our employees, and investment in the communities within which we operate.\n\nAs  future  development  projects  and  drilling  activities  bring  new  production  online,  the  Corporation  expects  a  shift  in  the geographic  mix  and  in  the  type  of  opportunities  from  which  volumes  are  produced.  Based  on  current  investment  plans,  the proportion of oil-equivalent production from the Americas is generally expected to increase over the next several years. About half of  the  Corporation's  global  production  comes from unconventional, deepwater and LNG resources. This proportion is generally expected to grow over the next few years.\n\nThe Upstream capital program continues to prioritize low cost-of-supply opportunities. In addition to continued development of Guyana, Brazil, and the Permian Basin, ExxonMobil has a strong pipeline of development projects. Most notable are our LNG developments in Mozambique, Papua New Guinea, and the Golden Pass LNG facility.\n\nThe Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir performance; performance of enhanced oil recovery projects; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; international trade patterns and relations; and other factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nExxonMobil believes prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand, with the demand side largely  being  a  function  of  general  economic  activities,  alternative  energy  sources,  levels  of  prosperity,  technology  advances, consumer preference and government policies. On the supply side, prices may be significantly impacted by political events, the actions  of  OPEC  and  other  large  government  resource  owners,  and  other  factors.  To  manage  the  risks  associated  with  price, ExxonMobil tests the resiliency of its annual plans and major investments across a range of price scenarios.\n\n## Key Recent Events\n\nSignificant progress was made on key new developments in Guyana, Brazil, the Permian Basin, and Mozambique during 2021.\n\nGuyana : Exploration success continued with additional discoveries increasing the estimated recoverable resource on the Stabroek block.  The  Liza  Unity  floating  production,  storage  and  offloading  vessel  arrived  in  Guyanese  waters  in  late  2021  and  started production in February 2022. In Payara, the third project, development drilling activities started in late 2021 and it remains on schedule for 2024 start-up. Yellowtail is the fourth and largest world-class development project and is expected to achieve first oil in 2025, following issuance of the production license.\n\nPermian : Production volumes averaged about 460 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day (koebd) in 2021, nearly 100 koebd yearon-year production increase which exceeded expectations. The Corporation was successful in increasing drilling performance and continuing to improve capital efficiency. In December, ExxonMobil announced plans to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 2030 from our unconventional operations in the Permian Basin.\n\nBrazil :  ExxonMobil announced its Final Investment Decision for the Bacalhau Phase 1 development in June 2021 with start-up planned for 2024.\n\nMozambique :  The  Area  4  Coral  South  Floating  LNG  (FLNG)  development  continues  as  planned,  targeting  start-up  in  2022, making Mozambique an LNG exporter. The Coral Sul FLNG vessel began tow to field in November 2021.",

In 2017, the governing agreements were extended to 2051.\n\n## AUSTRALIA / OCEANIA\n\n## Australia\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  conducted  offshore  in  Commonwealth  waters  are  governed  by  Federal  legislation. Exploration permits are granted for an initial term of six years with two possible five-year renewal periods. Retention leases may be granted for resources that are not commercially viable at the time of application, but are expected to become commercially viable within 15 years. These are granted for periods of five years and renewals may be requested. Prior to July 1998, production licenses were  granted  initially  for  21  years,  with  a  further  renewal  of  21  years  and  thereafter  indefinitely,  i.e.,  for  the  life  of  the  field. Effective from July 1998, new production licenses are granted indefinitely. In each case, a production license may be terminated if no production operations have been carried on for five years.\n\n## Papua New Guinea\n\nExploration and production activities are governed by the Oil and Gas Act. Petroleum prospecting licenses are granted for an initial term of six years with a five-year extension possible (an additional extension of three years is possible in certain circumstances). Generally, a 50-percent relinquishment of the license area is required at the end of the initial six-year term, if extended. Petroleum development licenses are granted for an initial 25-year period. An extension for further consecutive period(s) of up to 20 years may be granted at the Minister's discretion. Petroleum retention licenses may be granted for gas resources that are not commercially viable at the time of application, but may become commercially viable within the maximum possible retention time of 15 years. Petroleum  retention  licenses  are  granted  for  five-year  terms,  and  may  be  extended,  at  the  Minister's  discretion,  twice  for  the maximum  retention  time  of  15  years.  Extensions  of  petroleum  retention  licenses  may  be  for  periods  of  less  than  one  year, renewable annually, if the Minister considers at the time of extension that the resources could become commercially viable in less than five years, provided that the total period of all extensions granted does not exceed 10 years.",

      "answer": "ExxonMobil's long-lived asset value in Papua New Guinea decreased from $8,057 million in 2019 to $7,534 million in 2021, a decline of $523 million. During 2021, ExxonMobil relinquished 2.1 million net offshore acres in Papua New Guinea.

Development  activities  continued  on  the  Upper  Zakum  1  MBD Sustainment project.\n\n## AUSTRALIA / OCEANIA\n\n## Australia\n\nExxonMobil's net acreage totaled 1.8 million acres offshore and 10 thousand acres onshore at year-end 2021.\n\nThe co-venturer-operated Gorgon Jansz liquefied natural gas (LNG) development consists of a subsea infrastructure for offshore production and transportation of the gas, a 15.6 million tonnes per year LNG facility and a 280 million cubic feet per day domestic gas  plant  located  on  Barrow  Island,  Western  Australia.  The  Jansz-Io  Compression  project  was  funded  in  2021.  Development activities continued on the Gorgon Stage 2 project during the year.\n\n## Papua New Guinea\n\nExxonMobil's  net  acreage  totaled  3.4  million  acres,  of  which  1.2  million  net  acres  were  offshore  at  year-end  2021.  In  2021, ExxonMobil  relinquished  2.1  million  net  offshore  acres.  The  Papua  New  Guinea  (PNG)  liquefied  natural  gas  integrated development includes gas production and processing facilities in the southern PNG Highlands, onshore and offshore pipelines, and a 6.9 million tonnes per year liquefied natural gas facility near Port Moresby.\n\n## WORLDWIDE EXPLORATION\n\nAt  year-end  2021,  exploration  activities  were  under  way  in  several  areas  in  which  ExxonMobil  has  no  established  production operations and thus are not included above. A total of 18.3 million net acres were held at year-end 2021.\n\n## 6. Delivery Commitments\n\nExxonMobil sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing operations under a variety of contractual obligations, some of which may specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity for periods longer than one year. ExxonMobil also enters into natural gas sales contracts where the source of the natural gas used to fulfill the contract can be a combination of our own production and the spot market. Worldwide, we are contractually committed to deliver approximately 28 million barrels of oil and 2,500 billion cubic feet of natural gas for the period from 2022 through 2024. We expect to fulfill the majority of these delivery commitments with  production  from  our  proved  developed  reserves. Any  remaining  commitments  will  be  fulfilled  with  production  from  our proved undeveloped reserves and purchases on the open market as necessary.",

      "question": "Given that ExxonMobil had $527 million invested in Papua New Guinea projects as of December 31, 2021, and considering the country's regulatory framework for petroleum development licenses, how might the licensing timeline and extension conditions affect the long-term viability and progression of ExxonMobil's LNG projects such as Muruk, Papua LNG, and P'nyang?",
      "answer": "ExxonMobil had $527 million invested in Papua New Guinea projects as of 2021, including the Muruk, Papua LNG, and P'nyang developments, all of which are in the evaluation or progression phase. Papua New Guinea's regulatory framework grants petroleum development licenses for an initial 25-year period, with potential extensions of up to 20 years at the Minister\u2019s discretion. This licensing structure provides ExxonMobil with a potentially long runway to develop these LNG projects. However, the discretionary nature of license extensions introduces uncertainty, which could affect investment decisions and the timeline for progressing these projects to commercial production.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, extract the total investment value in Papua New Guinea projects as $527 million as of December 31, 2021, and identify the specific LNG projects: Muruk, Papua LNG, and P'nyang, which are in evaluation or progression phases.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, extract the regulatory framework in Papua New Guinea: petroleum development licenses are granted for 25 years with potential extensions of up to 20 years at the Minister\u2019s discretion.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize: The 25-year initial license term with potential for up to 20 more years provides ExxonMobil a long-term planning horizon for developing its $527 million LNG projects. However, the discretionary nature of extensions introduces uncertainty, which could impact long-term project viability and progression timelines."

      "answer": "ExxonMobil's upstream spending in 2021 totaled $12.3 billion, a 15% decrease from 2020, primarily driven by reduced investment in the U.S. Permian Basin. Despite this overall decline, Guyana remained a key focus area as development projects like Liza Phase 2 and Payara continued, with 11 net exploration and development wells completed in the region during the year. This contrasts with other regions such as the Gulf of Mexico, where only 0.8 net wells were completed, and the Netherlands, where only 0.5 net development wells were completed amid declining Groningen gas extraction. These figures indicate that Guyana was a strategic priority within ExxonMobil's upstream portfolio, even during a year of reduced overall capital investment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - ExxonMobil's upstream spending in 2021 was $12.3 billion, down 15% from 2020, with investments focused on the U.S. Permian Basin, Guyana, and Brazil.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - In Guyana, 11 net exploration and development wells were completed in 2021, with continued activity on Liza Phase 2 and Payara projects.",
        "Step 3: Extract comparative data from evidence_source_b - Other regions such as the Gulf of Mexico (0.8 net wells) and the Netherlands (0.5 net wells) saw much lower development activity during the same period.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The continued development in Guyana, despite overall upstream spending cuts, indicates a strategic emphasis on the region relative to other global areas with lower activity levels."

The Corporation plans to invest in the range of $21 billion to $24 billion in 2022. Included in the 2022 capital spend range is $8.3 billion of firm capital commitments. An additional $10.7 billion of firm capital commitments have been made for years 2023 and beyond. Actual spending could vary depending on the progress of individual projects and property acquisitions.\n\nUpstream spending of $12.3 billion in 2021 was down 15 percent from 2020, primarily in the U.S. Permian Basin. Investments in 2021 included the U.S. Permian Basin and key development projects in Guyana and Brazil. Development projects typically take several years from the time of recording proved undeveloped reserves to the start of production and can exceed five years for large and complex projects. The percentage of proved developed reserves was 66 percent of total proved reserves at year-end 2021, and has been over 60 percent for the last ten years.\n\nCapital investments in the Downstream totaled $2.1 billion in 2021, a decrease of $2.1 billion from 2020, reflecting lower global project  spending.  Chemical  capital  expenditures  of  $2.2  billion,  decreased  $0.5  billion,  representing  reduced  spend  on  growth projects.\n\n## TAXES\n\n",

      "question": "What was the percentage change in COP's natural gas reserves in the Asia Pacific/Middle East region from 2023 to 2024 for developed operations, and how does this compare to the change in total consolidated developed operations across all regions during the same period?",
      "answer": "The natural gas reserves in the Asia Pacific/Middle East region for developed operations decreased from 312 billion cubic feet in 2023 to 289 billion cubic feet in 2024, representing a 7.4% decrease. Meanwhile, total consolidated developed operations across all regions increased from 8,443 billion cubic feet in 2023 to 9,771 billion cubic feet in 2024, a 15.7% increase. This indicates that while COP experienced growth in total consolidated developed reserves, the Asia Pacific/Middle East region underperformed during the same period.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The natural gas reserves in the Asia Pacific/Middle East region for developed operations were 312 billion cubic feet in 2023 and 289 billion cubic feet in 2024.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The total consolidated developed operations across all regions were 8,443 billion cubic feet in 2023 and 9,771 billion cubic feet in 2024.",
        "Step 3: Calculate percentage change for Asia Pacific/Middle East developed reserves: ((289 - 312) / 312) * 100 = -7.4%.",
        "Step 4: Calculate percentage change for total consolidated developed operations: ((9,771 - 8,443) / 8,443) * 100 = 15.7%.",
        "Step 5: Synthesize - Compare the 7.4% decrease in Asia Pacific/Middle East developed reserves to the 15.7% increase in total consolidated developed operations, showing a divergence in performance."

      "answer": "Chevron's consolidated natural gas reserves in the Asia Pacific/Middle East region decreased by 16 billion cubic feet from 312 (2023) to 296 (2024). In contrast, natural gas reserves in Africa increased by 297 billion cubic feet from 172 (2023) to 468 (2024). Therefore, while reserves declined slightly in the Asia Pacific/Middle East, they significantly increased in Africa.",

      "question": "How did the number of productive acreage blocks in the Asia Pacific/Middle East region for COP in 2024 relate to the company's natural gas reserve additions in that region, and what does this indicate about COP's development strategy in the area?",
      "answer": "In 2024, COP reported 23 productive acreage blocks in the Asia Pacific/Middle East region from its consolidated operations and an additional 54 blocks through equity affiliates, totaling 77 productive blocks. During the same year, COP's natural gas reserve additions in the region were 296 billion cubic feet. This indicates that COP's development strategy in the Asia Pacific/Middle East region focuses on leveraging both direct operations and equity partnerships to maintain and potentially expand its natural gas reserves, with a significant portion of productive acreage supporting future reserve growth.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - COP reported 23 productive acreage blocks in the Asia Pacific/Middle East region from consolidated operations and 54 blocks through equity affiliates in 2024.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - COP reported natural gas reserves in the Asia Pacific/Middle East region of 296 billion cubic feet as of the end of 2024.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The high number of productive acreage blocks, particularly through equity affiliates, suggests a strategic focus on maintaining and growing natural gas reserves in the Asia Pacific/Middle East region through both direct operations and partnerships."
