      "question": "How does Linde's distribution of Process Gases through on-site plants influence its long-term contract structure and revenue recognition policy, based on the specific distribution and accounting practices described in the 2024 10-K filing?",
      "answer": "Linde's distribution of Process Gases through on-site plants leads to long-term contracts (typically 10\u201320 years) with minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions. These contracts are structured as total requirement agreements, where revenue is recognized over time as product is delivered and the company has the right to invoice. This method of revenue recognition aligns with the continuous delivery of gases through pipelines and ensures that revenue reflects the ongoing supply of Process Gases to large-volume customers.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Linde distributes Process Gases (including hydrogen, helium, and carbon dioxide) through on-site plants for large-volume customers, which are supplied via pipelines from plants constructed on or adjacent to customer sites.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - On-site contracts typically span 10\u201320 years, include minimum purchase requirements, and revenue is recognized over time as product is delivered and invoicing rights are established.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The use of on-site plants for distributing Process Gases necessitates long-term contracts to justify capital investment and ensure stable demand, which in turn shapes Linde\u2019s revenue recognition policy to align with delivery and invoicing over time."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, the company had recorded a total of $80 million and $75 million, respectively, representing an estimate of the retained liability for the ultimate cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet dates. The estimated liability is established using statistical analysis and is based upon historical experience, actuarial assumptions and professional judgment. These estimates are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity and frequency and are subject to a significant  degree  of  inherent  variability.  If  actual  claims  differ  from  the  company's  estimates,  they  will  be  adjusted  at  that  time  and  financial  results  could  be impacted.\n\nLinde recognizes estimated insurance proceeds relating to damages at the time of loss only to the extent of incurred losses. Any insurance recoveries for business interruption and for property damages in excess of the net book value of the property are recognized only when realized or pending payments confirmed by its insurance companies.\n\n## SEGMENT DISCUSSION\n\nLinde's operations consist of two major product lines: industrial gases and engineering. As further described in the following paragraph, Linde's industrial gases operations are managed on a geographic basis, which represents three of the company's reportable segments - Americas, EMEA (Europe/Middle East/Africa), and APAC (Asia/South  Pacific);  a  fourth  reportable  segment,  which  represents  the  company's  Engineering  business,  designs  and  manufactures  equipment  for  air separation and other industrial gas applications specifically for end customers and is managed on a worldwide basis operating in all geographic segments. Other consists of corporate costs and a few smaller businesses which individually do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation.\n\nThe industrial gases product line centers on the manufacturing and distribution of atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (hydrogen,  helium,  carbon  dioxide,  carbon  monoxide,  electronic  gases,  specialty  gases,  acetylene).  Many  of  these  products  are  co-products  of  the  same manufacturing process. Linde manufactures and distributes nearly all of its products and manages its customer relationships on a regional basis. Linde's industrial gases are distributed to various end-markets within a regional segment through one of three basic distribution methods: on-site or tonnage; merchant or bulk; and packaged or cylinder gases. The distribution methods are generally integrated in order to best meet the customer's needs and very few of its products can be economically transported outside of a region. Therefore, the distribution economics are specific to the various geographies in which the company operates and are consistent with how management assesses performance.\n\nThe company's measure of profit/loss for segment reporting purposes is segment operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as operating profit excluding purchase accounting impacts of the Linde AG  merger, cost reduction program and other charges, and items not indicative of ongoing business trends. This is the manner in which the company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") assesses performance and allocates resources.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Contracts with Customers\n\nLinde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, chemicals and energy, manufacturing, metals and mining, food and beverage, and electronics.\n\n## Industrial Gases\n\nWithin each of the company's geographic segments for industrial gases, there are three basic distribution methods: (i) on-site or tonnage; (ii) merchant or bulk liquid; and (iii) packaged or cylinder gases. The distribution method used by Linde to supply a customer is determined by many factors, including the customer's volume requirements and location. The distribution method generally determines the contract terms with the customer and, accordingly, the revenue recognition accounting practices. Linde's primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). These products are generally sold through one of the three distribution methods.\n\nFollowing is a description of each of the three industrial gases distribution methods and the respective revenue recognition policies:\n\nOn-site. Customers that require the largest volumes of product and that have a relatively constant demand pattern are supplied by cryogenic and process gas on-site plants.  Linde  constructs  plants  on  or  adjacent  to  these  customers'  sites  and  supplies  the  product  directly  to  customers  by  pipeline.  Where  there  are  large concentrations of customers, a single pipeline may be connected to several plants and customers. On-site product supply contracts generally are total requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from 10-20 years and contain minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions. Many of the cryogenic on-site plants also produce liquid products for the merchant market. Therefore, plants are typically not dedicated to a single customer. Additionally, Linde is responsible for the design, construction, operations and maintenance of the plants and our customers typically have no involvement in these activities. Advanced air separation processes also allow on-site delivery to customers with smaller volume requirements.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to on-site customers are satisfied over time as customers receive and obtain control of the product. Linde has elected to apply the practical ex pedient for measuring progress towards the completion of a performance obligation and recognizes revenue as the company has the right to invoice each customer, which generally corresponds with product delivery. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms. Consideration in these contracts is generally based on pricing which fluctuates with various price indices. Variable components of consideration exist within on-site contracts but are considered constrained.\n\nMerchant. Merchant deliveries generally are made from  Linde's plants by tanker trucks to storage containers at the customer's site.  Due to the relatively high distribution cost, merchant oxygen and nitrogen generally have a relatively small distribution radius from the plants at which they are produced. Merchant argon, hydrogen and helium can be shipped much longer distances.  The customer agreements used in the merchant business are usually three  to seven year supply agreements based on the requirements of the customer. These contracts generally do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to merchant customers are generally satisfied at a point in time as the customers receive and obtain control of the product. Revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms.\n\nPackaged Gases. Customers requiring small volumes are supplied products in containers called cylinders, under medium to high pressure. Linde distributes merchant gases from its production plants to company-owned cylinder filling plants where cylinders are then filled for distribution to customers. Cylinders may be delivered to the customer's site or picked up by the customer at a packaging facility or retail store. Linde invoices the customer for the industrial gases and the use of the cylinder container(s). The company also sells hardgoods and welding equipment purchased from independent manufacturers. Packaged gases are generally sold under one to three-year supply contracts and purchase orders and do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to packaged gases are satisfied at a point in time. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer or when the customer picks up product from a packaged gas facility or retail store, and the company has the right to payment from the customer in accordance with the contract terms.\n\n## Engineering\n\nThe company designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other industrial gas applications manufactured specifically for end customers. Sale of equipment contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation.",

      "answer": "Linde uses three distribution methods to supply process gases: on-site, merchant, and packaged. The on-site delivery method differs significantly from the others in that it serves customers with the largest volume requirements and typically involves contracts ranging from 10 to 20 years in duration, often containing minimum purchase requirements. In contrast, merchant and packaged gas contracts are generally shorter, ranging from three to seven years and one to three years respectively, and do not typically include minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.",

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nLinde plc (\"Linde\" or \"the company\") is an incorporated public limited company formed under the laws of Ireland. Linde's registered office is located at Ten Earlsfort Terrace, Dublin 2, D02 T380 Ireland. Linde's principal executive offices are located at Forge, 43 Church Street West, Woking, Surrey GU21 6HT, United Kingdom and 10 Riverview Drive, Danbury, Connecticut, 06810, United States. Linde trades on the Nasdaq under the symbol LIN.\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation -The consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\") and include the accounts of all significant subsidiaries where control exists and, in limited situations, variable-interest entities where the company is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation and any significant related-party transactions have been disclosed.\n\nEquity investments generally consist of 20% to 50% owned operations where the company exercises significant influence, but does not have control. Income from equity investments in corporations is reported on an after-tax basis. Pre-tax income from equity investments that are partnerships or limited-liability corporations is  included  in  other  income  (ex penses)  -  net  with  related  tax es  included  in  Income  tax es.  Equity  investments  are  reviewed  for  impairment  whenever  events  or circumstances reflect that an impairment loss may have been incurred.\n\nChanges in ownership interest that result either in consolidation or deconsolidation of an investment are recorded at fair value through earnings, including the retained ownership interest, while changes that do not result in either consolidation or deconsolidation of a subsidiary are treated as equity transactions.\n\nUse of Estimates -The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While actual results could differ, management believes such estimates to be reasonable.\n\nOperations -Linde is the largest industrial gases company globally. The company produces, sells and distributes atmospheric, process and specialty gases to a diverse group of industries including aerospace, chemicals, food and beverage, electronics, energy, healthcare, manufacturing, and metals. Linde's Engineering business  offers  its  customers  an  ex tensive  range  of  gas  production  and  processing  services  including  supplying  plant  components  and  services  directly  to customers.\n\nRevenue Recognition -Revenue is recognized as control of goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for the goods or services. See Note 19 for additional details regarding Linde's revenue recognition policies.\n\nCash Equivalents -Cash equivalents are considered to be highly liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less.\n\nInventories -Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the average-cost method.\n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment - Net -Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. The company capitalizes labor, applicable overhead and interest as part of the cost of constructing major facilities. Ex penditures for additions and improvements that extend the lives or increase the capacity of plant assets are also capitalized. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 years to 40 years (see Note 8). Linde uses accelerated depreciation methods for tax purposes where appropriate. Maintenance of property, plant and equipment is generally expensed as incurred.\n\nThe company performs a test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an individual asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Should projected undiscounted future cash flows be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an impairment charge reducing the carrying amount to fair value may be required. Fair value is determined based on the most appropriate valuation technique, including discounted cash flows.\n\nAsset-Retirement Obligations - An asset-retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which sufficient information exists to determine the fair value of the liability with a corresponding increase to the carrying amount of the related property, plant and equipment which is then depreciated over its useful life. The liability is initially measured at fair",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Contracts with Customers\n\nLinde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, chemicals and energy, manufacturing, metals and mining, food and beverage, and electronics.\n\n## Industrial Gases\n\nWithin each of the company's geographic segments for industrial gases, there are three basic distribution methods: (i) on-site or tonnage; (ii) merchant or bulk liquid; and (iii) packaged or cylinder gases. The distribution method used by Linde to supply a customer is determined by many factors, including the customer's volume requirements and location. The distribution method generally determines the contract terms with the customer and, accordingly, the revenue recognition accounting practices. Linde's primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). These products are generally sold through one of the three distribution methods.\n\nFollowing is a description of each of the three industrial gases distribution methods and the respective revenue recognition policies:\n\nOn-site. Customers that require the largest volumes of product and that have a relatively constant demand pattern are supplied by cryogenic and process gas on-site plants.  Linde  constructs  plants  on  or  adjacent  to  these  customers'  sites  and  supplies  the  product  directly  to  customers  by  pipeline.  Where  there  are  large concentrations of customers, a single pipeline may be connected to several plants and customers. On-site product supply contracts generally are total requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from 10-20 years and contain minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions. Many of the cryogenic on-site plants also produce liquid products for the merchant market. Therefore, plants are typically not dedicated to a single customer. Additionally, Linde is responsible for the design, construction, operations and maintenance of the plants and our customers typically have no involvement in these activities. Advanced air separation processes also allow on-site delivery to customers with smaller volume requirements.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to on-site customers are satisfied over time as customers receive and obtain control of the product. Linde has elected to apply the practical ex pedient for measuring progress towards the completion of a performance obligation and recognizes revenue as the company has the right to invoice each customer, which generally corresponds with product delivery. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms. Consideration in these contracts is generally based on pricing which fluctuates with various price indices. Variable components of consideration exist within on-site contracts but are considered constrained.\n\nMerchant. Merchant deliveries generally are made from  Linde's plants by tanker trucks to storage containers at the customer's site.  Due to the relatively high distribution cost, merchant oxygen and nitrogen generally have a relatively small distribution radius from the plants at which they are produced. Merchant argon, hydrogen and helium can be shipped much longer distances.  The customer agreements used in the merchant business are usually three  to seven year supply agreements based on the requirements of the customer. These contracts generally do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to merchant customers are generally satisfied at a point in time as the customers receive and obtain control of the product. Revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms.\n\nPackaged Gases. Customers requiring small volumes are supplied products in containers called cylinders, under medium to high pressure. Linde distributes merchant gases from its production plants to company-owned cylinder filling plants where cylinders are then filled for distribution to customers. Cylinders may be delivered to the customer's site or picked up by the customer at a packaging facility or retail store. Linde invoices the customer for the industrial gases and the use of the cylinder container(s). The company also sells hardgoods and welding equipment purchased from independent manufacturers. Packaged gases are generally sold under one to three-year supply contracts and purchase orders and do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to packaged gases are satisfied at a point in time. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer or when the customer picks up product from a packaged gas facility or retail store, and the company has the right to payment from the customer in accordance with the contract terms.\n\n## Engineering\n\nThe company designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other industrial gas applications manufactured specifically for end customers. Sale of equipment contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation.",

      "answer": "The net value of Brands/Tradenames for LIN decreased from $2,609 million in 2023 to $2,239 million in 2024, a reduction of $370 million. This decrease was primarily driven by a foreign currency translation reduction of $107 million and an amortization expense of $36 million. Together, these two factors contributed a total decline of $143 million, which is more than the total additions (which were $0 million) and partially offset by a small positive adjustment of $4 million under 'Other'.",

      "question": "How does Linde's involvement in the Amur GPP project, including contingent liabilities and contract suspensions, contrast with its revenue recognition policies for on-site industrial gas contracts, and what does this reveal about the financial risk exposure in long-term on-site agreements?",
      "answer": "Linde faces a contingent liability of $0.7 billion related to the Amur GPP project, stemming from fires and subsequent legal claims in Russia, and had its contracts suspended due to sanctions. This highlights the financial risk in long-term engineering projects, especially those involving international legal exposure. In contrast, Linde's on-site industrial gas contracts, which often span 10\u201320 years and include minimum purchase requirements, recognize revenue over time as product is delivered, based on the right to invoice. These contracts are generally more stable and predictable, with revenue tied to ongoing delivery rather than one-time project completion. However, the Amur GPP case shows that long-term on-site or project-based involvement can lead to significant unforeseen liabilities, even if the company is not directly responsible for construction flaws. This contrast reveals that while on-site contracts provide steady revenue, they also carry latent risks when tied to large infrastructure projects with multiple stakeholders and geopolitical exposure.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Linde has a $0.7 billion contingent liability related to the Amur GPP fires and legal claims in Russia, with performance suspended due to sanctions.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - The Amur GPP case illustrates that while on-site contracts are designed for long-term, stable revenue, involvement in large-scale infrastructure projects can expose Linde to significant legal and financial risks beyond its operational control."

As a result of the contract terminations, Linde no longer has future performance obligations for these projects.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate the timing of resolution of these matters. The company intends to vigorously defend its interests in the Russian Claims, Hong Kong arbitration proceedings and other jurisdictions.\n\n## Amur GPP\n\nIn  July  2015,  G azprom  Pererabotka  Blagoveshchensk  LLC  (\"G azprom\")  entered  into  an  engineering,  procurement  and  construction  contract  with  OJSC NIPIgazpererabotka (\"Nipigas\") for the construction of a gas processing plant and other components located in the Amur Region, Russia ('Amur GPP'). Subsequently,  in  December  2015,  Nipigas  and  Linde  Engineering,  executed  a  subcontract  for  engineering,  procurement,  and  site  services  for  licensed production units for the Amur GPP project. Additionally, Linde also entered into (i) a license agreement with G azprom in 2017 for the operation of the plants, and (ii) a direct owner agreement with G azprom and Nipigas which included limitation of liability provisions. Performance of the Amur GPP agreements were lawfully suspended in compliance with applicable sanctions on May 27, 2022.\n\nOn October 8, 2021 and January 5, 2022, fires occurred at the Amur GPP facility. Following the initial fire in 2021, Linde undertook a comprehensive review of the incident, including a detailed local inspection conducted by Linde employees. The Linde report concluded that the fire was attributable to the quality of construction and assembly work, responsibilities falling under the scope of Nipigas. On October 29, 2024, G azprom submitted a claim to the Arbitration State Court in the Amur Region, Russia ('Amur Court') against Linde claiming damages and lost profits arising from the fire incidents.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, Linde has a contingent liability of $0.7 billion for this and other Amur GPP contract matters. It is difficult to estimate the timing of resolution of this matter. The company intends to vigorously defend its interests in this case.\n\n## Commitments\n\nAt December 31, 2024, Linde had undrawn outstanding letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds valued at approximately $3,377 million from financial institutions. These relate primarily to customer contract performance guarantees (including plant construction in connection with certain on-site contracts), selfinsurance claims and other commercial and governmental requirements, including non-U.S. litigation matters.\n\nOther commitments related to leases, tax liabilities for uncertain tax  positions, long-term debt, other post retirement and pension obligations are summarized elsewhere in the financial statements (see Notes 4, 5, 11, and 16).\n\n## NOTE 18. SEGMENT INFORMATION\n\nLinde's operations consist of two major product lines: industrial gases and engineering. As further described in the following paragraph, Linde's industrial gases operations are managed on a geographic basis, which represent three of the company's reportable segments - Americas, EMEA (Europe/Middle East/Africa), and APAC  (Asia/South  Pacific);  a fourth  reportable  segment,  which  represents  the  company's  Engineering  business,  designs  and  manufactures  equipment  for  air separation and other industrial gas applications specifically for end customers and is managed on a worldwide basis operating in all three geographic segments. Other consists of corporate costs and a few smaller businesses, which individually do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation.\n\nThe industrial gases product line centers on the manufacturing and distribution of atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (hydrogen,  helium,  carbon  dioxide,  carbon  monoxide,  electronic  gases,  specialty  gases,  acetylene).  Many  of  these  products  are  co-products  of  the  same manufacturing process. Linde manufactures and distributes nearly all of its products and manages its customer relationships on a regional basis. Linde's industrial gases are distributed to various end-markets within a regional segment through one of three basic distribution methods: on-site or tonnage; merchant or bulk; and packaged or cylinder gases. The distribution methods are generally integrated in order to best meet the customer's needs and very few of its products can be economically transported outside of a region. Therefore, the distribution economics are specific to the various geographies in which the company operates and are consistent with how management assesses performance.\n\nThe CODM consists of the CEO, CFO and senior or executive vice president of each respective segment. The company's measure of profit/loss for segment reporting is segment operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as operating profit excluding purchase accounting impacts of the Linde AG  merger, cost reduction and other charges, and items not indicative of ongoing business trends. The CODM uses operating profit to assess overall segment performance, which",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Contracts with Customers\n\nLinde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, chemicals and energy, manufacturing, metals and mining, food and beverage, and electronics.\n\n## Industrial Gases\n\nWithin each of the company's geographic segments for industrial gases, there are three basic distribution methods: (i) on-site or tonnage; (ii) merchant or bulk liquid; and (iii) packaged or cylinder gases. The distribution method used by Linde to supply a customer is determined by many factors, including the customer's volume requirements and location. The distribution method generally determines the contract terms with the customer and, accordingly, the revenue recognition accounting practices. Linde's primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). These products are generally sold through one of the three distribution methods.\n\nFollowing is a description of each of the three industrial gases distribution methods and the respective revenue recognition policies:\n\nOn-site. Customers that require the largest volumes of product and that have a relatively constant demand pattern are supplied by cryogenic and process gas on-site plants.  Linde  constructs  plants  on  or  adjacent  to  these  customers'  sites  and  supplies  the  product  directly  to  customers  by  pipeline.  Where  there  are  large concentrations of customers, a single pipeline may be connected to several plants and customers. On-site product supply contracts generally are total requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from 10-20 years and contain minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions. Many of the cryogenic on-site plants also produce liquid products for the merchant market. Therefore, plants are typically not dedicated to a single customer. Additionally, Linde is responsible for the design, construction, operations and maintenance of the plants and our customers typically have no involvement in these activities. Advanced air separation processes also allow on-site delivery to customers with smaller volume requirements.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to on-site customers are satisfied over time as customers receive and obtain control of the product. Linde has elected to apply the practical ex pedient for measuring progress towards the completion of a performance obligation and recognizes revenue as the company has the right to invoice each customer, which generally corresponds with product delivery. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms. Consideration in these contracts is generally based on pricing which fluctuates with various price indices. Variable components of consideration exist within on-site contracts but are considered constrained.\n\nMerchant. Merchant deliveries generally are made from  Linde's plants by tanker trucks to storage containers at the customer's site.  Due to the relatively high distribution cost, merchant oxygen and nitrogen generally have a relatively small distribution radius from the plants at which they are produced. Merchant argon, hydrogen and helium can be shipped much longer distances.  The customer agreements used in the merchant business are usually three  to seven year supply agreements based on the requirements of the customer. These contracts generally do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to merchant customers are generally satisfied at a point in time as the customers receive and obtain control of the product. Revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms.\n\nPackaged Gases. Customers requiring small volumes are supplied products in containers called cylinders, under medium to high pressure. Linde distributes merchant gases from its production plants to company-owned cylinder filling plants where cylinders are then filled for distribution to customers. Cylinders may be delivered to the customer's site or picked up by the customer at a packaging facility or retail store. Linde invoices the customer for the industrial gases and the use of the cylinder container(s). The company also sells hardgoods and welding equipment purchased from independent manufacturers. Packaged gases are generally sold under one to three-year supply contracts and purchase orders and do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to packaged gases are satisfied at a point in time. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer or when the customer picks up product from a packaged gas facility or retail store, and the company has the right to payment from the customer in accordance with the contract terms.\n\n## Engineering\n\nThe company designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other industrial gas applications manufactured specifically for end customers. Sale of equipment contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation.",
