      "answer": "The Coca-Cola Company reported $720 million in hedge funds and limited partnerships within its consolidated financial statements and $9 million in such investments within its other postretirement benefit plan assets for 2021. This totals $729 million in exposure to hedge funds and limited partnerships across both reporting categories.",

          "chunk_text": "\nNet cash used in financing activities generally consisted of debt transactions, dividends paid, repurchases of Company stock and transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders. Fiscal 2025 net cash used in financing activities increased $1.4 billion when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increase is primarily due to lapping debt issuances in the prior fiscal year and increased share repurchases, partially offset by the purchase of certain noncontrolling interests in the prior fiscal year and higher short-term borrowings.

We must anticipate and meet our customers' changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in our competitors' operations through focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating segment. We continue to invest in AI and generative AI technologies to enhance our customers' shopping experience and our associate work experience and to improve efficiencies of our supply chain, operations, management functions and talent recruitment and development; however, these are evolving technologies and there are inherent operational and legal complexities associated with implementation of these technologies within our business. When integrating and introducing AI and generative AI technologies into our platforms, processes and systems, we may be exposed to new or expanded liabilities and risks due to elevated governmental scrutiny and monitoring, litigation, data privacy risks and compliance issues in a disparate and at times conflicting regulatory environment, all of which could negatively affect our financial performance and business reputation.\n\nSome of the various technology systems and services on which we rely are provided and managed by an increasing number of third-party service providers. To the extent either our or such other third-party systems and services do not perform or function as anticipated, whether because of an inherent flaw in the technology, faulty implementation or a cybersecurity incident, such failure can significantly interfere with our ability to meet our customers' changing ex pectations. Any disruption or failure on our part to provide attractive, user-friendly and secure digital platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise and services at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and digital platform merchandising and related technology in a cost-efficient manner could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of eCommerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our eCommerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n\nAny failure to maintain the privacy or security of the information relating to our company, customers, members, associates, business partners and vendors, whether as a result of cyberattacks on our information systems or otherwise, could damage our reputation, result in litigation or other legal actions against us, result in fines, penalties, and liability, cause us to incur substantial additional costs and materially adv ersely affect our business and operating results.\n\nLike most retailers, we process in our information systems personal information and/or payment information about our customers and members, and we also process information concerning our associates and vendors. In addition, our health and wellness business operations and third-party service providers who handle information on our behalf store and maintain protected health information. Further, we recently acquired VIZIO Holding Corp. and its subsidiaries, which collects certain consumer data, including certain television viewing data. Some of this information is stored digitally in connection with the digital platforms and technologies that we use to conduct and facilitate our various businesses. We utilize third-party service providers for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, for digital storage technology, compute capacity, medical record documentation, content delivery to customers and members, back-office support and other functions. Such providers may have access to information we hold about our customers, members, associates, business partners or vendors. In addition, our eCommerce operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments.\n\nCyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for disrupting or obtaining access to information systems or information stored in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated and frequent, and in some cases, they may lead to successful attacks. Unauthorized activities directed against information systems and devices, whether our own or those of our third-party service providers and vendors, have resulted in cybersecurity incidents, including malware, ransomware, denial of service attacks or phishing incidents. We expect that our information systems and those of our third-party service providers, vendors and suppliers will continue to experience such attacks in the future, which could include disruptions to our supply chain system. Cyberattacks and threat actors can be sponsored by particular nation-states, or be the work of sophisticated criminal organizations, insiders (including our associates or contractors) or third parties, each with a wide-range of motives and expertise. We and the businesses with which we interact have experienced and continue to experience incidents and threats to data and information systems. These incidents and threats have included and are likely to continue to include both random and targeted cyberattacks, computer viruses, phishing incidents, worms, bot attacks, ransomware or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate customer information, including credit card and payment information, and cause system failures and disruptions. The use of remote work infrastructure in recent years has also increased the possible attack surfaces to be ex ploited. Our logging capabilities, or the logging capabilities of third parties, are also not always complete or sufficiently detailed, affecting our ability to fully investigate and understand the scope of security events. As noted above, some of our information systems and those of our third-party service providers have experienced cybersecurity incidents or breaches, including during fiscal 2025, and, although to date they have not had a material adverse effect on our operating results or business, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future.\n\nOur digital platforms, which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope, and the systems on which they run, including those applications and systems used in legacy operations and acquired eCommerce, technology or other businesses, are regularly subject to cyberattacks. Those attacks involve attempts to impede the operations of",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Overview\n\nThis discussion, which presents our results for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025 (\"fiscal 2025\"), January 31, 2024 (\"fiscal 2024\") and January 31, 2023 (\"fiscal 2023\"), should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole.\n\nThroughout this Item 7, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures.  Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker.\n\nManagement also measures the results of comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, for a particular period from the corresponding prior year period. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated digitally, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs as well as certain other business offerings that are part of our ecosystem, such as our advertising net sales. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than 5%. Sales related to divested businesses are excluded from comparable sales, and sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as \"same-store\" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nIn discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the effect of changes in currency ex change rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency ex change rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency ex change rates have impacted and may continue to impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment.\n\nWe have taken certain strategic actions across our segments, including an increased emphasis on investments in automation and supply chain as well as diversifying our earnings streams through category and business mix. In December 2024, the Walmart U.S. segment completed the acquisition of VIZIO Holding Corp. for net cash consideration of $1.9 billion. Additionally, we have taken actions in the Walmart International segment to reshape our portfolio including the following highlights over the last three years:\n\n- In November 2022, we completed the buyout of the noncontrolling interest shareholders of our Massmart subsidiary (Refer to Note 3) and in December 2022, we exited operations in certain countries in Africa.\n- In December 2022, we increased our ownership in PhonePe as part of the separation from our majority-owned Flipkart subsidiary. Refer to Note 3.\n- In August 2024, we sold our equity investment in JD.com for net proceeds of $3.6 billion. Refer to Note 8.\n\nWe operate in a highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce, health and wellness, financial services, advertising and data service businesses. Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence. We compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality associates. We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather and other risks related to climate change, global health epidemics and pandemics, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, disruptions in supply chain, inventory management, cost and availability of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, inflation, deflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic",

          "chunk_text": "## Walmart International Segment\n\nWalmart International is our second largest segment and operates 5,566 stores across 18 countries outside of the U.S. Walmart International operates through our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Canada, Chile, China, and Africa (which includes Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Eswatini, and Zambia), and our majority-owned subsidiaries in India, as well as Mexico and Central America (which includes Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua).\n\nWalmart International includes numerous formats divided into two major categories: retail and wholesale. These categories consist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets, warehouse clubs (including our membership-only Sam's Club format) and cash and carry, as well as eCommerce through websites and mobile applications, including walmart.com.mx, walmart.ca, flipkart.com, PhonePe and other sites. Walmart International had net sales of $121.9 billion for fiscal 2025, representing 18% of our fiscal 2025 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $114.6 billion and $101.0 billion for fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nWalmart International's strategy is to bring Walmart to the world and the world to Walmart, which means we help millions of customers and members save money and live better every day by leveraging our global ecosystem and deep local expertise to provide access to affordable products and services. In addition, we share what we learn in our markets to help the enterprise innovate and grow even faster. We are being deliberate about where and how we choose to operate and continue to reshape the portfolio to best enable long-term, sustainable and profitable growth. As such, we have taken certain strategic actions to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, which include the following highlights over the last three years:\n\n- Bought out the noncontrolling interest shareholders of our Massmart subsidiary in November 2022 and exited operations in certain countries in Africa.\n- Increased our ownership in PhonePe, our digital payments platform in India, as part of the separation from Flipkart in December 2022.\n- Sold our equity investment in JD.com in August 2024.\n\nOmni-channel. Walmart International provides a convenient and seamless omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce, such as through our pickup and delivery services in most of our markets, including same-day delivery. We continue to expand our marketplace offerings, which also further unlocks fulfillment and advertising services.\n\nGenerally, retail units' selling areas range in size from 1,400 square feet to 186,000 square feet. Our wholesale stores' selling areas generally range in size from 25,000 square feet to 158,000 square feet. As of January 31, 2025, Walmart International had approximately 2,900 pickup and delivery locations.\n\nMerchandise and Other Offerings. The merchandising strategy for Walmart International is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and developed market specific private brands to serve our customers with high quality, low priced items. Along with the private brands we market globally, such as \"Equate,\" \"George,\" \"Great Value,\" \"Holiday Time,\" \"Mainstays,\" \"Marketside\" and \"Parent's Choice,\" our international markets have developed market specific brands including \"Aurrera\" and \"Lider.\" In addition, we have developed and continue to grow our relationships with regional and local suppliers in each market to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at low prices.\n\nConsistent with its strategy, Walmart International continues to build mutually reinforcing businesses in areas such as advertising, marketplace and fulfillment services, financial services and healthcare. Our businesses in Mexico and Canada, for example, offer prepaid cards and money transfers, and our PhonePe business in India continues to grow, providing a platform that offers mobile and bill payment, person-to-person (P2P) payment, investment and insurance solutions, financial services and advertising. In Mexico, we also offer a value-based internet and telephone service enhancing customer experiences through digital connectivity.\n\nDistribution. We utilize a total of 184 distribution facilities located in Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Mex ico and Africa. Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International segment. During fiscal 2025, the majority of Walmart International's purchases passed through these distribution facilities. Suppliers ship the remainder of Walmart International's purchases directly to our stores in the various markets in which we operate. Across the segment, we have efficient networks connecting physical stores and distribution and fulfillment centers, which facilitate the movement of goods to where our customers live.",

MD&amp;A is prov ided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). This section generally discusses the results of operations for 2024 compared to 2023. For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for 2023 compared to 2022 refer to Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our fiscal year 2023 Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on October 11, 2023.\n\n## Overview\n\nWe  believ e  that  the  most  important  driv er  of  our  profitability  is  increasing  net  sales,  particularly  comparable  sales.  Net  sales  includes  our  core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary (gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire installation) and other businesses (e-commerce, business centers, trav el and other). E-commerce and business center sales are allocated to the appropriate merchandise categories in the Net Sales discussion. Comparable sales is defined as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce sites operating for more than one year. The measure is intended as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and should be reviewed  in  conjunction  with  results  reported  in  accordance  with  U.S.  GAAP.  Comparable  sales  growth  is  achiev ed  through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each v isit (av erage ticket). Sales comparisons can also be  particularly  influenced  by  certain  factors  that  are  beyond  our  control:  fluctuations  in  currency  exchange  rates  (with  respect  to  our  international operations) and inflation or deflation in the cost of gasoline and associated competitiv e conditions. T he higher our comparable sales exclusiv e of these items, the more we can lev erage our SG&amp;A expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making av ailable the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believ e we hav e repeatedly demonstrated ov er the long-term. Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is v igorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believ e that we hav e been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our priv ate-label items, and through online offerings.\n\nOur philosophy is to prov ide our members with quality goods and serv ices at competitiv e prices. We do not focus in the short-term on maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believ e is a perception among our members of our 'pricing authority' - consistently prov iding the most competitiv e v alues. Our net sales and gross margin are influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases. Those strategies can include, but are not limited to, working with our suppliers to share in absorbing cost increases, earlier-than-usual purchasing and in greater  v olumes,  as  well  as  passing  cost  increases  on  to  our  members.  Our  inv estments  in  merchandise  pricing  may  include  reducing  prices  on merchandise to driv e sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, negativ ely impacting gross margin and gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage) in the near term.",

There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further rev iew of our capital expenditure needs and the economic env ironment.\n\n## Cash Flows from Financing Activities\n\nNet cash used in financing activ ities totaled $10,764 in 2024, compared to $2,614 in 2023. Cash flow used in financing activ ities primarily related to the payment of div idends, repayments of long-term debt and short-term borrowings, repurchases of common stock, and withholding taxes on stock-based awards. On May 18, 2024, we paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance on the 2.750% Senior Notes, using cash and cash equiv alents and shortterm inv estments. Cash flow prov ided by financing activ ities included proceeds from short-term borrowings and four Guaranteed Senior Notes totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%, issued by our Japan subsidiary.\n\n## Dividends\n\nCash dividends declared in 2024 totaled $8,589 or $19.36 per share, as compared to $1,703 or $3.84 per share in 2023. Div idends in 2024 included a special div idend of $15 per share, resulting in a payment of approximately $6,655. In April 2024, the Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash div idend from $1.02 to $1.16 per share.\n\n## Share Repurchase Program\n\nOn January 19, 2023, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program in the amount of $4,000, which expires in January 2027. During 2024 and 2023, we repurchased 1,004,000 and 1,341,000 shares of common stock, at an average price per share of $695.29 and $504.68, totaling approximately $698 and $677. These amounts may differ from the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled repurchases at the end of each fiscal year. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases, pursuant  to  plans  under  SEC  Rule  10b5-1.  Repurchased  shares  are  retired,  in  accordance  with  the  Washington  Business  Corporation  Act.

Our  international  operations  maintain  $710  of  this  capacity  under  bank  credit  facilities,  of  which  $167  is  guaranteed  by  the Company. Short-term borrowings outstanding under the bank credit facilities, which are included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\n\nWe have letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $214. T he outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of 2024 totaled $193, most of which were standby letters of credit that do not expire or hav e expiration dates within one year.  The bank credit facilities hav e v arious expiration dates, most within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities. T he amount of borrowings av ailable at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding.\n\n## Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nIn the opinion of management, we hav e no off-balance sheet arrangements that hav e had or are reasonably likely to hav e a material current or future effect on our financial condition or financial statements.",

The Company also enters into v ariable-priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for its gas stations,  on  an  index  basis.

Income Taxes\n\nOn August 6, 2019, Switzerland published changes to its Federal tax law in the Official Federal Collection of Laws. On September 27, 2019, the Zurich Canton published their decision on the September 1, 2019 Zurich Canton public vote regarding the Cantonal changes associated with the Swiss Federal tax law change. The intent of these tax law changes was to replace certain preferential tax regimes with a new set of internationally accepted measures that are hereafter referred to as 'Swiss tax reform'. Based on these Federal/Cantonal events, it is our position that enactment of Swiss tax reform for U.S. GAAP purposes was met as of September 30, 2019, and we recorded the impacts in the third quarter of 2019. The net impact was a benefit of $767 million, which consisted of a $769 million reduction in deferred tax expense from an allowed step-up of intangible assets for tax purposes (recorded net of valuation allowance) and remeasurement of our deferred tax balances, partially offset by a $2 million indirect tax impact in selling, general and administrative expenses. The ongoing impacts of these Swiss tax reform law changes became effective January 1, 2020. With the acquisition of Chipita in January 2022 (refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures ), we believe there is a reasonable possibility that a significant portion of the valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax asset for the step-up of intangible assets will no longer be needed. The amount of the valuation allowance to be released in 2022 is dependent on the increase in Switzerland's future taxable income.\n\nEarnings/(losses) from continuing operations before income taxes and the provision for income taxes consisted of:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "internationally accepted measures that are hereafter referred to as 'Swiss tax reform'. Based on these Federal / Cantonal events, our position is the enactment of Swiss tax reform for U.S. GAAP purposes was met as of September 30, 2019, and we recorded the impacts in the third quarter 2019. The net impact was a benefit of $767 million, which consisted of a $769 million reduction in deferred tax expense from an allowed step-up of intangible assets for tax purposes and remeasurement of our deferred tax balances, partially offset by a $2 million indirect tax impact in selling, general and administrative expenses. The ongoing impacts of these Swiss tax reform law changes became effective January 1, 2020. See Note 16, Income Taxes , for more information.\n\n## Summary of Results\n\n- Net revenues were approximately $28.7 billion in 2021 and $26.6 billion in 2020, an increase of 8.0% in 2021 and an increase of 2.8% in 2020. In 2021, our net revenue growth continued to reflect increased demand for most of our snack category products in both our emerging and developed markets relative to 2020, though some markets were not yet back to pre-pandemic levels. In developed markets, increased food purchases for in-home consumption continued to drive net revenue growth, partially offset by declines in some markets as they lapped prior-year strong volume growth resulting from increased consumer demand due to the pandemic. In emerging markets, we lapped the negative initial impacts we experienced from the pandemic in 2020, with strong revenue growth in 2021 across most of our key markets, though some markets remained challenged. In addition, our out-of-home consumption businesses, which experienced significant negative impacts from the pandemic in 2020, continued to recover, particularly our gum and candy, foodservice and world travel retail businesses.\n- -Net revenues increased in 2021, driven by favorable volume/mix, higher net pricing, a significant impact from favorable currency translation, as most currencies we operate in strengthened against the U.S. dollar compared to exchange rates in the prior year, and incremental net revenues from our acquisitions of Gourmet Foods, Grenade and Hu in 2021 and Give &amp; Go in 2020.\n- -Net revenues increased in 2020, driven by higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix and incremental net revenues from our acquisitions of Give &amp; Go in 2020 and Perfect Snacks in 2019. These items were partially offset by the significant impact of unfavorable currency translation, as the U.S. dollar strengthened against most currencies in which we operate compared to exchange rates in the prior year, as well as the May 28, 2019 divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa.\n- Organic Net Revenue increased 5.2% to $28.0 billion in 2021 and increased 3.7% to $26.8 billion in 2020. Organic Net Revenue increased in both 2021 and 2020 due to favorable volume/mix and higher net pricing, despite impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic described above. Organic Net Revenue is on a constant currency basis and excludes revenue from acquisitions and divestitures. We use Organic Net Revenue as it provides improved year-over-year comparability of our underlying operating results (see the definition of Organic Net Revenue and our reconciliation with net revenues within Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section).\n- Diluted EPS attributable to Mondel\u0113z International increased 23.1% to $3.04 in 2021 and decreased 8.2% to $2.47 in 2020.\n- -Diluted EPS increased in 2021 primarily driven by an increase in Adjusted EPS, lapping prior-year costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction, favorable year-over-year mark-to-market impacts from currency and commodity derivatives, lower intangible asset impairment charges, lapping the prioryear loss on interest rate swaps, lower losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses, lower Simplify to Grow program costs and a net benefit from acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments. These factors were partially offset by a lower gain on equity method investment transactions, higher initial impacts from enacted tax law changes, lower net earnings from divestitures, lapping the prior-year benefit from the resolution of tax matters and higher impact from pension participation changes.\n- -Diluted EPS decreased in 2020 primarily driven by lapping the prior-year benefit from initial impacts from enacted tax law changes, costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction, loss on debt extinguishment, unfavorable year-over year change in equity method investee items, higher intangible asset impairment charges, unfavorable year-over-year mark-to-market impacts from currency and commodity derivatives, lapping a prior-year gain on divestiture and lapping the prior-year benefit from pension participation changes. These factors were partially offset by gains on equity method investment transactions, higher Adjusted EPS, favorable change from the resolution of tax matters (a benefit in 2020 as compared to an expense in 2019), lower Simplify to Grow program costs and lower losses related to interest rate swaps.",

      "answer": "The Swiss Tax Reform had a significant negative impact on MDLZ's effective tax rate in 2019, reducing it by 22.3%. This was the largest single factor affecting the effective tax rate that year, which stood at 0.1% overall. In comparison, in 2020 and 2021, there was no direct impact from Swiss Tax Reform, and the effective tax rates were 36.2% and 27.2%, respectively. The absence of Swiss tax reform impact in 2021 contributed to a more normalized effective tax rate compared to the abnormally low rate in 2019.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, we learn that Swiss tax reform was a significant tax law change impacting MDLZ, with specific changes published in 2019 by both the Swiss Federal government and Zurich Canton.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, we extract the specific tax impact of Swiss tax reform in 2019, which was a -22.3% adjustment to the effective tax rate, bringing it down to 0.1% overall.",
        "Step 3: We compare this to the 2020 and 2021 effective tax rates (36.2% and 27.2%) from evidence_source_b, noting that Swiss tax reform had no direct impact in those years, allowing other factors to shape the effective tax rate."

As we continue to proactively manage our business in response to the evolving impacts of the pandemic, we continue to prioritize and support our employees and customers; monitor and work to further safeguard our supply chain, operations, technology and assets; protect our liquidity and financial position; work toward our strategic priorities and monitor our financial performance. We seek to position the Company to withstand the current uncertainties related to this pandemic and to emerge stronger.\n\n## Chipita Acquisition\n\nOn January 3, 2022, we closed on our acquisition of Chipita S.A., which is a strategic complement to our existing snacks portfolio and advances our strategy to become the global leader in broader snacking. The cash consideration for Chipita totaled \u20ac1.3 billion ($1.5 billion) and we assumed and also substantially paid down \u20ac0.4 billion ($0.4 billion) of Chipita's debt in January for a total purchase price of approximately \u20ac1.7 billion ($1.9 billion). Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures , and Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional details.\n\n## KDP and JDE Peet's Equity Method Investment Transactions\n\n## KDP\n\nOn June 7, 2021, we sold approximately 28 million shares of KDP, which reduced our ownership interest to 6.4%. We received $997 million of proceeds and recorded a pre-tax gain of $520 million (or $392 million after-tax) during the second quarter of 2021. On August 2, 2021, we sold approximately 14.7 million KDP shares, which reduced our ownership interest to 5.3%. We received $500 million of proceeds and recorded a pre-tax gain of $248 million (or $189 million after-tax) during the third quarter of 2021. The cash taxes associated with the KDP share sales were paid in 2021.\n\nOn March 4, 2020, we participated in a secondary offering of KDP shares and sold approximately 6.8 million shares, which reduced our ownership interest by 0.5% to 13.1%. We received $185 million of proceeds and recorded a pre-tax gain of $71 million (or $54 million after-tax) during the first quarter of 2020. Subsequently, on August 3, 2020, we sold approximately 14.1 million shares and on September 9, 2020, we sold approximately 12.5 million shares, which in the aggregate reduced our KDP ownership interest to 11.2%. During the third quarter of 2020, we received $777 million of proceeds and recorded pre-tax gains of $335 million (or $258 million after tax). On November 17, 2020, we sold approximately 40.0 million shares, which reduced our ownership interest by 2.8% to 8.4%. We received $1,132 million of proceeds and recorded a pre-tax gain of $459 million (or $350 million after tax) during the fourth quarter of 2020. The cash taxes associated with the KDP share sales were paid in 2020.\n\nDuring 2019, we recognized a $23 million pre-tax gain related to the impact of a KDP acquisition that decreased our ownership interest from 13.8% to 13.6%.\n\n## JDE Peet's\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, in connection with the JDE Peet's offering of its ordinary shares, we exchanged our 26.4% ownership interest in JDE for a 26.5% equity interest in JDE Peet's. On May 29, 2020, we participated in the JDE Peet's offering and, with the subsequent exercise of the over-allotment option, we sold a total of approximately 11.1 million shares during the second quarter of 2020. We received \u20ac350 million ($394 million) of total proceeds from the sales of JDE Peet's shares and we recorded a preliminary pre-tax gain of $121 million during the second quarter of 2020. We also incurred a $261 million tax expense. During the third quarter of 2020, we increased our preliminary gain by $10 million to $131 million. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we reduced our tax expense by $11 million to $250 million and we paid the associated cash tax by the end of 2021.\n\nFor additional information, refer to Note 7, Equity Method Investments , Note 16, Income Taxes , and Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements .\n\n## Tax Reform\n\nWe continue to monitor existing and potential future tax reform. In 2019, the most significant tax reform impact was from Swiss tax reform. On August 6, 2019, Switzerland published changes to its Federal tax law in the Official Federal Collection of Laws. On September 27, 2019, the Zurich Canton published their decision on the September 1, 2019 Zurich Canton public vote regarding the Cantonal changes associated with the Swiss Federal tax law change. The intent of these tax law changes was to replace certain preferential tax regimes with a new set of",

      "answer": "PepsiCo's ability to manage international operations and maintain revenue stability in 2023 is negatively impacted by the risk of currency demonetization, as highlighted in both the economic conditions and developing/emerging market sections. In the economic conditions section, PepsiCo notes that demonetization, along with devaluation and fluctuation of currency, could result in adverse changes in interest rates, contraction in credit availability, and increased employee benefit costs due to pension asset devaluation. These factors can disrupt cash flow and increase operational costs. In the developing/emerging market section, PepsiCo specifically mentions that currency exchange restrictions, including demonetization, can significantly affect its ability to manage operations and may lead to the deconsolidation of businesses in these markets. Together, these risks create a dual constraint on PepsiCo\u2019s financial flexibility and market expansion strategy, particularly in high-risk jurisdictions like Russia, South Africa, and others.",

      "question": "Given that Target's owned and exclusive brands account for approximately one-third of its sales and carry higher margins than national brands, what financial risk does Target face if it fails to successfully develop, source, and market these brands, particularly considering the longer lead times and increased responsible sourcing risks involved?",
      "answer": "If Target fails to successfully develop, source, and market its owned and exclusive brands\u2014which represent approximately one-third of its overall sales and generally carry higher margins\u2014its results of operations could be significantly adversely affected. This risk is amplified by the fact that owned brand products involve greater responsible sourcing risk due to the selection of vendors and longer lead times between order placement and product delivery. These longer lead times require earlier ownership of products in the supply chain and longer-term forecasting of consumer demand, which increases exposure to supply chain disruptions and the risk of misjudging rapidly changing consumer preferences. Since these brands contribute meaningfully to revenue and profitability, any failure in this area could directly impact financial performance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - 'Approximately one-third of our sales come from our owned and exclusive brands,' indicating the significant contribution of these brands to revenue.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - 'Our owned and exclusive brand products represent approximately one third of our overall sales and generally carry higher margins than equivalent national brand products,' showing the profitability aspect of these brands.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b - 'Our reliance on owned and exclusive brand products may also amplify other risks... because many of these products are imported and we are more involved in the development and sourcing of those products,' highlighting the increased complexity and risk in sourcing and forecasting.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The combination of the importance of owned brands to revenue and margins, along with the increased operational and reputational risks due to longer lead times and sourcing complexity, creates a significant financial risk if these challenges are not effectively managed."

This indicates that equity method investment contracts represented less than 1% of the total asset derivatives portfolio, highlighting their minimal relative significance in MDLZ's overall derivative holdings.",

Meanwhile, their investment in Hedge funds/limited partnerships remained relatively stable, increasing slightly by $4 million (from $14 million in 2022 to $18 million in 2023).

This amount is categorized entirely under the 'Other' column in the second table, which consolidates the fair value of investments not classified under Levels 1, 2, or 3.

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, identify the amount under 'Hedge funds/limited partnerships' in the 'Other' category as $18 million for December 31, 2023.",

        "Step 4: Conclude that the total fair value of investments in hedge funds and limited partnerships is $1,057 million, as explicitly stated in the second table."

Therefore, Walmart spent $2.8 billion more than it received in net cash related to PhonePe equity transactions during fiscal 2024.",

      "answer": "Walmart's majority stake in Flipkart, acquired in 2018, exposes it to potential financial risks due to ongoing regulatory proceedings initiated by India's Directorate of Enforcement. These proceedings investigate alleged violations of India's Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) rules by Flipkart and its subsidiaries during 2009\u20132015, prior to Walmart's acquisition. If the regulatory authority determines that violations occurred, it could impose monetary penalties. Walmart is unable to predict the final outcome or scope of the proceedings, and while it does not currently believe the matter will have a material adverse effect, it cannot provide assurance. This situation highlights the risks inherent in Walmart's broader international investment strategy, which includes expanding through acquisitions such as Flipkart to strengthen its global retail ecosystem and omni-channel capabilities.",

This is lower than the company's 35% global market share in fabric care, where it holds the number one or number two position globally. Therefore, while P&G maintains strong leadership in fabric care, its position in home care, which includes Febreze, is slightly less dominant.",

The settlem ent charge was triggered when the aggregate of the cum ulative lum p sum  distributions and the annuity contract prem ium  exceeded the total annual service and interest costs. Pension and retiree m edical-related im pact also includes curtailm ent losses due to restructuring actions as part of our 2019 Productivity Plan.\n\nSee Notes 7 and 13 to our consolidated financial statem ents for further inform ation.\n\n## Our Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nWe believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities, working capital lines and other available m ethods of debt financing, such as com m ercial paper borrowings and long-term  debt financing, will be adequate to m eet our operating, i n v esti n g   an d  f i n an ci n g   n eeds,  i n cl u di n g   w i th   respect  to  ou r  n et  capi tal   spen di n g   pl an s.  Ou r  pri m ary   sou rces  of   l i qu i di ty   i n cl u de  cash   f rom operations, proceeds obtained from  issuances of com m ercial paper and long-term  debt, and cash and cash equivalents. These sources of cash are available  to  fund  cash  outflows  that  have  both  a  short-  and  long-term   com ponent,  including  debt  repaym ents  and  related  interest  paym ents; payments  for  acquisitions;  operating  leases;  purchase,  m arketing,  and  other  contractual  com m itm ents,  including  capital  expenditures  and  the transiti on tax l i abi l i ty  u n der th e T ax  Cu ts an d Jobs Act (TCJ Act). In addi ti on, these sources of cash fund other cash outflows including anticipated dividend payments and share repurchases. W e do not have guarantees or off-balance sheet financing arrangem ents, including variable interest entiti es, that we believe could have a m aterial im pact on our liquidity . See 'Item  1A. Risk Factors,' 'Our Business Risks' and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statem ents for further inform ation.\n\nAs of December 28, 2024, cash, cash equivalents and short-term  investm ents in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency controls or currency exchange restrictions were not m aterial.\n\nThe TCJ Act imposed a one-time mandatory transition tax on undistributed international earnings. As of Decem ber 28, 2024, our m andatory transiti on  tax  l i abi l i ty   was  $1.7  bi l l i on ,  wh i ch   m u st  be  pai d  th rou g h   2026  u n der  th e  prov i si on s  of   th e  TCJ  Act;  we  cu rren tl y   ex pect  to  pay approximately $772 million of this liability in 2025. Any additional guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) m ay im pact our recorded amounts for this transition tax liability. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statem ents for further discussion of the TCJ Act.\n\nSupply chain financing arrangem ents did not have a m aterial im pact on our liquidity or capital resources in the periods presented and we do not expect  such  arrangem ents  to  have  a  m aterial  im pact  on  our  liquidity  or  capital  resources  for  the  foreseeable  future.  See  Note  14  to  our consolidated financial statem ents for further discussion of supply chain financing arrangem ents.\n\nFurthermore, our cash provided from  operating activities is som ewhat im pacted by seasonality . W orking capital needs are im pacted by weekly sales, which are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related patterns and generally lowest in the first quarter. On a continuing  basis,  we  consider  various  transactions  to  increase  shareholder  value  and  enhance  our  business  results,  including  acquisitions, divestitures,  joint  ventures,  dividends,  share  repurchases,  productivity  and  other  efficiency  initiatives  and  other  structural  changes.  These transactions m ay result in future cash proceeds or paym ents.",

Summary of Accounting Policies\n\nOrganization We are a general merchandise retailer selling products to our guests through our stores and digital channels.\n\nWe operate as a single segment that includes all of our continuing operations, which are designed to enable guests to purchase products seamlessly in stores or through our digital channels. Nearly all of our revenues are generated in the United States (U.S.). The vast majority of our long-lived assets are located within the U.S.\n\nConsolidation The  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  balances  of  Target  and  its  subsidiaries  after  elimination  of intercompany balances and transactions. All material subsidiaries are wholly owned.\n\nUse of estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles  (GAAP)  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  affecting  reported  amounts  in  the  consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates.\n\nFiscal year Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31. Unless otherwise stated, references to years in this report relate to fiscal years, rather than to calendar years. Fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 ended January 29, 2022, January 30, 2021, and February 1, 2020, respectively, and consisted of 52 weeks. Fiscal 2022 will end January 28, 2023, and will consist of 52 weeks.\n\nAccounting policies Our  accounting  policies  are  disclosed in the applicable Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation.\n\n## 2. Coronavirus (COVID-19)\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. In 2020 and 2021, governments took various measures in response to COVID-19, such as mandating the closure of certain businesses at times and encouraging or requiring citizens to avoid large gatherings. To date, virtually all of our stores, digital channels, and distribution centers have remained open.\n\nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced strong comparable sales growth and significant volatility in our sales category and channel mix, including same-day fulfillment options. Note 4 presents sales by category. We have taken various actions,  including  accelerating  purchases  of  certain  merchandise  in  our  core  categories  and,  early  in  the  pandemic,  slowing  or canceling purchase orders, primarily for Apparel and Accessories. As a result of these actions, we recorded $226 million of purchase order cancellation fees in Cost of Sales in 2020.\n\n## 3. Dermstore Sale\n\nIn  February  2021,  we  sold  our  wholly  owned  subsidiary  Dermstore  LLC  (Dermstore)  for  $356  million  in  cash  and  recognized  a $335 million pretax gain, which is included in Net Other (Income) / Expense. Dermstore represented less than 1 percent of our consolidated revenues, operating income and net assets.\n\nTARGET CORPORATION\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\nNOTES",

In addition to country of origin production delays, trucker and dockworker shortages, a broad-based surge in consumer demand, and other factors have led to industry-wide U.S. port and ground transportation delays. In response, we have taken various actions, including ordering merchandise earlier, securing ocean freight routes, and increased use of air transport for certain merchandise. Some of these supply chain disruptions and resulting actions have resulted in increased costs. The Gross Margin Rate analysis on page 22 provides additional information.\n\n## Sale of Dermstore\n\nIn February 2021, we sold Dermstore LLC (Dermstore) for $356 million in cash and recognized a $335 million pretax gain, which is included  in  Net  Other  (Income)  /  Expense.

          "chunk_text": "## Background and Basis of Presentation:\n\n## Background\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. is a holding company incorporated in Virginia, U.S.A. (also referred to herein as the U.S., the United States or the United States of America), whose subsidiaries and affiliates and their licensees are primarily engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and reduced-risk products including heat-not-burn, vapor and oral nicotine products, in markets outside of the United States of America. In addition, during 2021, 2020 and 2019, PMI shipped versions of its Platform 1 device and its consumables authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") to Altria Group, Inc., for sale in the United States under license. For further developments related to the sale of these products in the U.S., see Note 17. Contingencies . Throughout these financial statements, the term \"PMI\" refers to Philip Morris International Inc. and its subsidiaries.\n\nReduced-risk products (\"RRPs\") is the term PMI uses to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less  risk  of  harm  to  smokers  who  switch  to  these  products  versus  continuing  smoking.    PMI  has  a  range  of  RRPs  in  various  stages  of development, scientific assessment and commercialization.\n\n\"Platform  1\"  is  the  term  PMI  uses  to  refer  to  PMI's  reduced-risk  product  that  uses  a  precisely  controlled  heating  device  into  which  a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol.\n\n## Basis of presentation\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  Significant  estimates  and  assumptions  include,  among  other  things:  pension  and  benefit  plan  assumptions;  useful  lives  and valuation  assumptions  of  goodwill  and  other  intangible  assets;  valuation  assumptions  for  non-marketable  equity  securities;  marketing programs, and income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include PMI, as well as its wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. Investments in which PMI exercises  significant  influence  (generally  20%-50%  ownership  interest)  are  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  of  accounting. Investments not accounted for under the equity method of accounting are measured at fair value, if it is readily determinable, with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Investments without readily determinable fair values, non-marketable equity securities, are measured and recorded using a measurement alternative that values the security at cost minus any impairment. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2021, the former Latin America &amp; Canada segment was renamed as the Americas segment. Additionally, due to the acquisitions of Fertin Pharma A/S, Vectura Group plc. and OtiTopic, Inc. in the third quarter of 2021, PMI added an Other category. For further details, see Note 6. Acquisitions and Note 12. Segment Reporting .\n\nAs of March 22, 2019, PMI deconsolidated the financial results of its Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. (\"RBH\") from PMI's financial statements. For further details, see Note 20. Deconsolidation of RBH .\n\nCertain prior years' amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year's presentation. The changes did not have a material impact on PMI's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in any of the periods presented.",

In East Asia & Australia, revenues from Reduced-Risk Products increased from $2,671 million in 2019 to $3,539 million in 2021, a growth of $868 million. Combined, these two regions contributed $7,603 million in net revenues in 2021 from Reduced-Risk Products, showing they are central to PMI\u2019s strategy to transition smokers to reduced-risk alternatives.

(also referred to herein as the U.S., the United States or the United States of America), whose subsidiaries and affiliates and their licensees are primarily engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and reduced-risk products including heat-not-burn, vapor and oral nicotine products, in markets outside of the United States of America. In addition, during 2021, 2020 and 2019, PMI shipped versions of its Platform 1 device and its consumables authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") to Altria Group, Inc., for sale in the United States under license. For further developments related to the sale of these products in the U.S., see Note 17. Contingencies . Throughout these financial statements, the term \"PMI\" refers to Philip Morris International Inc. and its subsidiaries.\n\nReduced-risk products (\"RRPs\") is the term PMI uses to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less  risk  of  harm  to  smokers  who  switch  to  these  products  versus  continuing  smoking.    PMI  has  a  range  of  RRPs  in  various  stages  of development, scientific assessment and commercialization.\n\n\"Platform  1\"  is  the  term  PMI  uses  to  refer  to  PMI's  reduced-risk  product  that  uses  a  precisely  controlled  heating  device  into  which  a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol.\n\n## Basis of presentation\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  Significant  estimates  and  assumptions  include,  among  other  things:  pension  and  benefit  plan  assumptions;  useful  lives  and valuation  assumptions  of  goodwill  and  other  intangible  assets;  valuation  assumptions  for  non-marketable  equity  securities;  marketing programs, and income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include PMI, as well as its wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. Investments in which PMI exercises  significant  influence  (generally  20%-50%  ownership  interest)  are  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  of  accounting. Investments not accounted for under the equity method of accounting are measured at fair value, if it is readily determinable, with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Investments without readily determinable fair values, non-marketable equity securities, are measured and recorded using a measurement alternative that values the security at cost minus any impairment. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2021, the former Latin America &amp; Canada segment was renamed as the Americas segment. Additionally, due to the acquisitions of Fertin Pharma A/S, Vectura Group plc. and OtiTopic, Inc. in the third quarter of 2021, PMI added an Other category. For further details, see Note 6. Acquisitions and Note 12. Segment Reporting .\n\nAs of March 22, 2019, PMI deconsolidated the financial results of its Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. (\"RBH\") from PMI's financial statements. For further details, see Note 20. Deconsolidation of RBH .\n\nCertain prior years' amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year's presentation. The changes did not have a material impact on PMI's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in any of the periods presented.",

For  further  information  on  significant  accounting  policies,  see  discussion  in  Note  1  to  the  consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\n\n## Insurance/Self-insurance Liabilities\n\nClaims  for  employee  health-care  benefits,  workers'  compensation,  general  liability,  property  damage,  directors'  and officers' liability, vehicle liability, inventory loss, and other exposures are funded predominantly through self-insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for certain risks to seek to limit exposures arising from very large losses. We use different  risk  management  mechanisms,  including  a  wholly-owned  captive  insurance  subsidiary,  and  participate  in  a reinsurance program. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated by using historical  claims  experience,  demographic  factors,  severity  factors,  and  other  actuarial  assumptions.  The  costs  of claims  are  highly  unpredictable  and  can  fluctuate  as  a  result  of  inflation  rates,  regulatory  or  legal  changes,  and unforeseen developments in claims.

Failure  to  identify  and  implement  a succession plan for senior management could negatively impact our business. We must attract, train and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees, while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core values. Our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous internal and external factors, including the continuing impacts  of  the  pandemic,  regulatory  changes,  prevailing  wage  rates,  union  relations  and  healthcare  and  other insurance costs. We compete with other retail and non-retail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## We may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance.\n\nClaims  for  employee  health  care  benefits,  workers'  compensation,  general  liability,  property  damage,  directors'  and officers' liability, vehicle liability, inventory loss, and other exposures are funded predominantly through self-insurance.

The  types  and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements. Significant claims or events, regulatory changes, a substantial rise in costs of health care or costs to maintain our insurance or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAlthough we maintain specific coverages for catastrophic property losses, we still bear a significant portion of the risk of losses incurred as a result of any physical damage to, or the destruction of, any warehouses, depots, manufacturing or home office facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption. Such losses could materially impact our cash flows and results of operations.\n\n## Market and Other External Risks\n\nWe face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe retail business is highly competitive.

Such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of ways, including pricing, selection and availability, services, location, convenience, store hours, and the attractiveness and ease of use of websites and mobile applications. The evolution of retailing in online and mobile channels has improved the ability of customers to comparison shop, which has enhanced competition. Some competitors have greater financial resources and technology capabilities, better access to merchandise, and greater market penetration than we do. Our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, changes in the retail markets or customer expectations could result in lost market share and negatively affect our financial results.\n\n## General  economic  factors,  domestically  and  internationally,  may  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nHigher energy and gasoline costs, inflation, levels of unemployment, healthcare costs, consumer debt levels, foreigncurrency  exchange  rates,  unsettled  financial  markets,  weaknesses  in  housing  and  real  estate  markets,  reduced consumer confidence, changes and uncertainties related to government fiscal",

Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise, and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and low prices, our warehouses are not elaborate. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits and using a membership format, we believe our inventory losses (shrinkage) are well below those of typical retail operations.\n\nOur  warehouses  on  average  operate  on  a  seven-day,  70-hour  week.  Gasoline  operations  generally  have  extended hours. Because the hours of operation are shorter than many other retailers, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities, reducing labor required. In general, with variations by country, our warehouses accept certain credit cards, including Costco co-branded cards, debit cards, cash and checks, Executive member 2% reward certificates, co-brand cardholder rebates, and our proprietary storedvalue card (shop card).\n\nOur  strategy  is  to  provide  our  members  with  a  broad  range  of  high-quality  merchandise  at  prices  we  believe  are consistently lower than elsewhere. We seek to limit most items to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors. We carry less than 4,000 active stock keeping units (SKUs) per warehouse in our core warehouse business, significantly less than other broadline retailers. We average anywhere from 10,000 to 11,000 SKUs online, some of which are also available in our warehouses. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case, carton, or multiple-pack quantities only.\n\nIn keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain electronic items, we typically have a 90-day return policy and provide, free of charge, technical support services, as well as an extended warranty. Additional third-party warranty coverage is sold on certain electronic items.\n\nWe offer merchandise and services in the following categories:\n\n## Core Merchandise Categories (or core business):\n\n- Foods and Sundries (including sundries, dry grocery, candy, cooler, freezer, deli, liquor, and tobacco)\n- Non-Foods (including  major  appliances,  electronics,  health  and  beauty  aids,  hardware,  garden  and  patio, sporting  goods,  tires,  toys  and  seasonal,  office  supplies,  automotive  care,  postage,  tickets,  apparel,  small appliances, furniture, domestics, housewares, special order kiosk, and jewelry)\n- Fresh Foods (including meat, produce, service deli, and bakery)\n\nWarehouse Ancillary (includes gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire installation) and Other Businesses (includes e-commerce, business centers, travel, and other)\n\nWarehouse ancillary businesses operate primarily within or next to our warehouses, encouraging members to shop more frequently. The number of warehouses with gas stations varies significantly by country, and we have no gasoline business in Korea or China. We operated 668 gas stations at the end of 2022. Net sales for our gasoline business increased to approximately 14% of total net sales in 2022.\n\nOur  other  businesses  sell  products  and  services  that  complement  our  warehouse  operations  (core  and  warehouse ancillary businesses). Our e-commerce operations give members convenience and a broader selection of goods and services.  Net  sales  for  e-commerce  represented  approximately  7%  of  total  net  sales  in  2022.  This  figure  does  not include  other  services  we  offer  online  in  certain  countries  such  as  business  delivery,  travel,  same-day  grocery,  and various other services. Our business centers carry items tailored specifically for food services, convenience stores and offices, and offer walk-in shopping and deliveries.

Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&amp;A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China and the United  States,  have  affected  the  costs  of  some  of  our  merchandise.  The  degree  of  our  exposure  is  dependent  on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. Higher tariffs could adversely impact our results.\n\nWe also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses  and  cannibalization  of  sales  at  existing  warehouses  when  openings  occur  in  existing  markets,  are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower  gross  margin  percentage  relative  to  our  warehouse  operations.  E-commerce  sales  growth  slowed  in  2022 compared to 2021 and 2020.\n\nThe membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets.\n\nOur financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this  area,  some  significant  costs  are  partially  outside  our  control,  particularly  health  care  and  utility  expenses.  With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction  requires  maintaining  compensation  levels  that  are  better  than  the  industry  average  for  much  of  our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements  of  income,  particularly  merchandise  costs  and  SG&amp;A  expenses,  can  have  substantial  impacts  on  net income.\n\nOur operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canadian, and Other International operating segments (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report). Certain operations in the Other International  segment  have  relatively  higher  rates  of  square  footage  growth,  lower  wage  and  benefit  costs  as  a percentage of sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, or lack e-commerce or business delivery.\n\nIn discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period's currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period.\n\nOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to 2022, 2021, and 2020 relate to the 52-week fiscal  years  ended  August  28,  2022,  August  29,  2021,  and  August  30,  2020,  respectively.

If inflation on merchandise increases beyond our ability to control we may not be able to adjust prices  to  sufficiently  offset  the  effect  of  the  various  cost  increases  without  negatively  impacting  consumer  demand. Certain merchandise categories were impacted by inflation higher than what we have experienced in recent years due to, among other things, the continuing impacts of the pandemic and uncertain economic environment.\n\nSuppliers  may  be  unable  to  timely  supply  us  with  quality  merchandise  at  competitive  prices  or  may  fail  to adhere to our high standards, resulting in adverse effects on our business, merchandise inventories, sales, and profit margins.\n\nWe depend heavily on our ability to purchase quality merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. As the quantities we require continue to grow, we have no assurances of continued supply, appropriate pricing or access to new products, and any supplier has the ability to change the terms upon which they sell to us or discontinue selling to us. Member demands may lead to out-of-stock positions causing a loss of sales and profits.\n\nWe  buy  from  numerous  domestic  and  foreign  manufacturers  and  importers.  Our  inability  to  acquire  suitable merchandise  on  acceptable  terms  or  the  loss  of  key  suppliers  could  negatively  affect  us.  We  may  not  be  able  to develop relationships with new suppliers, and products from alternative sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality or more expensive. Because of our efforts to adhere to high quality standards for which available supply may be limited, particularly for certain food items, the large volumes we demand may not be consistently available.\n\nOur suppliers (and those they depend upon for materials and services) are subject to risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activities, financial liquidity, natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, public health emergencies, supply constraints and general economic and political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable  merchandise.  One  or  more  of  our  suppliers  might  not  adhere  to  our  quality  control,  packaging,  legal, regulatory,  labor,  environmental  or  animal  welfare  standards.  These  deficiencies  may  delay  or  preclude  delivery  of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members. This failure could lead to recalls and litigation and otherwise damage our reputation and our brands, increase costs, and otherwise adversely impact our business.",

This valuation concluded that the fair value of PMI\u2019s investment in RBH was $714 million, significantly lower than its carrying value, leading to a non-cash impairment charge of $2,316 million recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024.",

Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\nTobacco-Related Litigation for Smoking and Health Class Actions and Health Care Cost Recovery Cases\n\nAs described in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has nine smoking and health class actions and 17 health care cost recovery cases pending. The Company records provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when management determines that an unfavorable outcome is  probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Except as stated otherwise in Note 18, while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, after assessing the information available, (i) management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending smoking and health class actions and health care cost recovery cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending smoking and health class actions and health care cost recovery cases; and (iii) accordingly, no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases, if any.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to tobacco-related litigation for smoking and health class actions and health care cost recovery actions is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when assessing the probability of a loss being incurred and determining whether the amount or range of the potential loss for each case can be reasonably estimated and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management's assessment of the loss contingencies associated with smoking and health class actions and health care cost recovery actions.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's assessment of smoking and health class actions and health care cost recovery cases, including controls over determining whether the probability and range of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as controls over financial statement disclosures. These procedures also included, among others (i) confirming with external and internal legal counsel the possibility or probability of an unfavorable outcome and the extent to which the loss or range of loss is reasonably estimable; (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of management's assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable; and (iii) evaluating the sufficiency of the  Company's smoking and health class actions and health care cost recovery cases contingencies disclosures.\n\nImpairment Related to the Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Equity Investment\n\nAs described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, since the 2019 deconsolidation of Rothmans, Benson and Hedges Inc. (RBH), the Company has accounted for its continuing investment in the business as an equity security, without readily determinable fair value. On January 24, 2025, RBH filed an objection to approval of the proposed plan of compromise and arrangement (Proposed Plan) with the CCAA court. Developments, including the positions taken by RBH in this objection  and  the  positions  taken  by  other  parties  in  related  filings  narrowed  the  range  of  possible  outcomes  with  respect  to  the  allocation  of  the  aggregate settlement, which was determined to be an indicator that the Company's investment in RBH may be impaired. Although there remains some uncertainty as to the final terms of the Proposed Plan, management evaluated its investment in RBH for potential impairment and concluded that the estimated fair value of its investment in RBH was lower than its carrying value. As a result, management performed a quantitative valuation of its investment in RBH as of December 31, 2024, and recorded a non-cash  impairment  charge  of  $2,316  million.  The  fair  value  of  the  continuing  investment  in  RBH  of  $714  million  represented  the  estimated  fair  value  of  the underlying business, net of management's best estimate of the share of the aggregate global settlement amount that could be allocated to RBH, and was determined based on an income approach using a discounted cash flow analysis. In determining the fair value of the investment in RBH, management made various judgments, estimates and assumptions, the most significant of which were discount rate, sales volumes and operating margins related to the fair value of the combustible tobacco product business in Canada. In addition, significant estimates were made with respect to the allocation amount of the aggregate global settlement amount, as well as the deductibility of the settlement amount payment for income tax purposes in Canada.",

PMI holds an approximate 25% economic interest in Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Tabacs Alg\u00e9ro-Emiratie ('STAEM'), an Algerian joint venture that is  51% owned by EITA and 49% by the Algerian state-owned enterprise Management et D\u00e9veloppement des Actifs et des Ressources Holding (\"MADAR Holding\"), which manufactures and distributes under license some of PMI's brands (SSEA, CIS &amp; MEA segment).\n\nIn  April  2023,  PMI  acquired  an  approx imate  economic  interest  of 25%  in  United  Tobacco  Company  (\"UTC\").  UTC  is  an  entity  incorporated  in  Egypt  which manufactures products under license for PMI's Egyptian subsidiary. On May 16, 2024, PMI acquired a controlling interest in UTC. For further details, see Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures .\n\nIn May 2024, PMI acquired an indirect economic interest of 14.7% in Eastern Company ('Eastern\"), Egypt's largest cigarette manufacturer which also includes cigars and pipe tobacco, among others, in its portfolio. PMI accounted for its investment in Eastern under the equity method of accounting as it has the indirect ability to participate in Eastern's policy making processes. In relation to the acquisition, PMI subsequently entered into an agreement in August 2024 to guarantee certain credit facilities and repayment of certain bank loan liabilities. The max imum amount of these guarantee obligations is $385 million and they will be in effect until 2034. As of December 31, 2024, PMI has not finalized the basis difference allocation resulting from the investment.\n\nThe initial investments in Megapolis Distribution BV , EITA, Eastern and UTC (up to the acquisition of controlling interest in UTC on May 16, 2024) have been recorded  at  cost  and  are  included  in  equity  investments  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets.  Transactions  between  these  equity  method  investees  and  PMI subsidiaries are considered to be related-party transactions and are included in the tables below.\n\n## Equity securities:\n\nOn March 22, 2019, PMI's wholly owned subsidiary in Canada, Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. ('RBH') obtained an initial order from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice granting it protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (\"CCAA\"), which is a Canadian federal law that permits a Canadian business to restructure its affairs while carrying on its business in the ordinary course with minimal disruption to its customers, suppliers and employees. The administration of the CCAA process, principally relating to the powers provided to the court under the CCAA and the oversight provided by the court appointed monitor, removes certain elements of control of the business from both PMI and RBH. As a result, PMI determined that it no longer had a controlling financial interest over RBH as defined in ASC 810 (Consolidation), and deconsolidated RBH as of the date of the CCAA filing.\n\nSince the deconsolidation of RBH on March 22, 2019, PMI has accounted for its continuing investment in RBH in accordance with ASC 321 (Investments-Equity Securities) as an equity security, without readily determinable fair value, and recorded its continuing investment in RBH at fair value of $3,280 million, which included the estimated settlement amount at the date of deconsolidation, within equity investments.\n\nOn October 17, 2024, the court-appointed mediator and monitor in the CCAA proceedings filed a proposed plan of compromise and arrangement ('Proposed Plan') setting forth, among other things, certain terms of a proposed comprehensive resolution of Canadian tobacco claims and related litigation. Under the resolution contemplated by the Proposed Plan, RBH, Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited (\"ITL\") and JTI Macdonald Corp (\"JTIM\") would pay an aggregate global settlement amount of CAD 32.5 billion (approximately $22.3 billion). A significant determinative factor in the analysis of impairment indicators was the issue of allocation of CAD 32.5 billion aggregate settlement amount among RBH, ITL, and JTIM which remained unresolved at the time of filing.\n\nThere has been no agreed allocation under the Proposed Plan and there has been no ruling from the CCAA court on the matter. On January 24, 2025, RBH filed an objection to approval of the Proposed Plan with the CCAA court (for further details, see Note 18. Contingencies ). Developments, including the positions taken by RBH in this objection and the positions taken by other parties in related filings narrowed the range of possible outcomes with respect to the allocation of the aggregate  settlement  amount  of  CAD 32.5 billion among  RBH,  ITL, and  JTIM, which was determined to be an indicator that PMI's investment in RBH may be impaired. Although there remains some uncertainty as to the final terms of the Proposed plan, PMI evaluated its investment in RBH for potential impairment and concluded that the estimated fair value of its investment in  RBH was lower than its carrying value. As a result,  PMI performed a quantitative valuation of its investment in RBH as of December 31, 2024, and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $2,316 million in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024, as a recognized subsequent event. The fair value of PMI's continuing investment in RBH of $714 million represented the estimated fair value of the underlying business, net of PMI's best estimate of the share of the aggregate global settlement amount that could be allocated to RBH, and was determined based on an income approach using a discounted cash flow analysis.\n\nIn determining the fair value of PMI's investment in RBH, PMI made various judgements, estimates and assumptions, the most significant of which were the discount rate, sales volumes and operating margins related to the fair value of the combustible tobacco product business in Canada. In addition, significant estimates were made with respect to the allocation amount of the aggregate global",

      "answer": "Approximately 3.02% of PMI's total stock awards reserved under all plans at December 31, 2024, were still available for grant under the 2017 Stock Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors. This is calculated by dividing the 855,920 shares available under the 2017 Non-Employee Directors Plan by the total 27,288,770 shares reserved across all stock plans. This relatively small proportion indicates that the majority of PMI's stock-based compensation is directed toward broader employee incentive plans, with the Non-Employee Directors Plan representing a smaller, more targeted component focused on board-level compensation.",

        "Step 4: Synthesize the significance: The small proportion of shares available under the Non-Employee Directors Plan relative to total stock awards shows that board-level compensation represents a limited but formalized portion of PMI\u2019s overall stock-based compensation strategy."

From July 22, 2021 through March 31, 2022, PMI repurchased 10.5 million shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $1.0 billion. During the first three months of 2022, PMI repurchased 2.0 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $199 million. On May 11, 2022, we announced the suspension of the three-year share repurchase program following the recommended public offer to acquire the outstanding shares of Swedish Match from its shareholders. For further details, see Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures. Prior to the suspension of the program, PMI made no share repurchases during the second quarter of 2022. The three-year share repurchase program expired on July 21, 2024.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, 27,288,770 shares of common stock were reserved for stock awards under PMI's stock plans, and 250 million shares of preferred stock, without par value, were authorized but unissued. PMI currently has no plans to issue any shares of preferred stock.\n\n## Note 10.\n\n## Stock Plans:\n\nIn May 2022, PMI's shareholders approved the Philip Morris International Inc. 2022 Performance Incentive Plan (the '2022 Plan'). Under the 2022 Plan, PMI may grant to eligible employees restricted shares and restricted share units, performance-based cash incentive awards and performance-based equity awards. Up  to 25 million shares of PMI's common stock may be issued under the 2022 Plan. At December 31, 2024, shares available for grant under the 2022 Plan were 19,189,876.\n\nIn May 2017, PMI's shareholders approved the Philip Morris International Inc. 2017 Stock Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the '2017 Non-Employee Directors Plan'). A non-employee director is defined as a member of the PMI Board of Directors who is not a full-time employee of PMI or of any corporation in which PMI owns, directly or indirectly, stock possessing at least 50% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote in the election of directors in such corporation. Up to 1 million shares of PMI common stock may be awarded under the 2017 Non-Employee Directors Plan. At December 31, 2024, shares available for grant under the plan were 855,920.\n\n## Restricted share unit (RSU) awards\n\nPMI may grant RSU awards to eligible employees; recipients may not sell, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber such awards. Such awards are subject to forfeiture if certain employment conditions are not met. RSU awards generally vest on the third anniversary of the grant date. RSU awards do not carry voting rights, although they do earn dividend equivalents.",

          "chunk_text": "## Item 1. Business.\n\n## General Development of Business\n\n## General\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. is a V irginia holding company incorporated in 1987. In March 2008, we became a U.S. public company listed on the New Y ork Stock Exchange and subject to the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). We are a leading international tobacco company, actively delivering a smoke-free future and evolving our portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. Our current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, we have invested over $14 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This investment includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as postmarket studies. In November 2022, we acquired Swedish Match AB (\"Swedish Match\") - a leader in oral nicotine delivery - creating a global smoke-free combination led by the companies' IQOS and ZYN brands. Following a robust science-based review, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA\") has authorized the marketing of Swedish Match's General snus and ZYN nicotine pouches and versions of PMI's IQOS devices and consumables - the first-ever such authorizations in their respective categories. V ersions of IQOS devices and consumables and General snus also obtained the first-ever Modified Risk Tobacco Product (\"MRTP\") authorizations from the FDA. We describe the MRTP orders in more detail in the \"Business Environment\" section of Item 7. Management' s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations .\n\nThrough our acquisition of Swedish Match in 2022, with its leading nicotine pouch franchise in the U.S. under the ZYN brand name, we acquired a market leader in oral nicotine delivery with a significant presence in the United States market. The Swedish Match acquisition has been a key milestone in PMI's transformation to becoming a smoke-free company. The Swedish Match product portfolio is complementary to our existing portfolio, permitting us to bring together a leading oral nicotine product with the leading heat-not-burn product. By joining forces with Swedish Match, we expect to accelerate the achievement of our joint smoke-free ambitions, switching more adults who would otherwise continue to smoke cigarettes to better alternatives faster than either company could achieve separately.\n\nIn 2022, we reached an agreement with Altria G roup, Inc. to end our commercial relationship in the U.S. covering IQOS as of April 30, 2024. PMI now holds the full rights to commercialize IQOS in the U.S. For further details, see Item 8, Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures .\n\nIn 2021, we began our long-term growth ambitions beyond nicotine in wellness and healthcare given our strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences. Our Wellness and Healthcare business strategy currently focuses on developing and commercializing oral and inhaled consumer health and wellness offerings and inhaled  prescription  products  for  therapy  areas  that  include  pain  management  and  cardiovascular  emergencies.  This  includes  medical  and  pharmaceutical cannabinoids,  and  non-recreational  cannabinoid  products  (including  CBD),  in  line  with  applicable  regulatory  requirements,  though  any  revenue  related  to cannabinoids is expected to be negligible in the near to medium term.\n\nSmoke-Free Business (\"SFB') is the term PMI uses to refer to all of its smoke-free products. SFB also includes wellness and healthcare products, as well as consumer accessories, such as lighters and matches.\n\nSmoke-free products (also referred to herein as \"SFPs\") is the term PMI uses to refer to all of its products that provide nicotine without combusting tobacco, such as heat-not-burn, e-vapor, and oral smokeless, and that therefore generate far lower levels of harmful chemicals. As such, these products have the potential to present less risk of harm versus continued smoking.\n\nWe have a range of SFPs in various stages of development, scientific assessment and commercialization. Our smoke-free products are designed for, and directed toward, current adult smokers and adult users of nicotine-containing products. We put significant effort to restrict access of our products from non-smokers and youth. We believe regulation must include measures designed to prevent youth initiation; and we also support and engage with relevant authorities to seek sensible regulation of flavors, mandated health warnings and minimum age laws.\n\nOur IQOS smoke-free product brand portfolio includes heated tobacco and nicotine-containing vapor products. It uses a precisely controlled heating device into which a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol. Heated tobacco units (\"HTUs\") is the term we use to refer to heated tobacco consumables, which include our BLENDS , DELIA , HEETS , HEETS Creations (defined collectively as \" HEETS \"), SENTIA , TEREA, TEREA CRAFTED and TEREA Dimensions, as well\n\n## PART I",

          "chunk_text": "## RISK FA CTORS\n\nReputational harm can also occur indirectly through companies and others with whom we do business or whose products we sell. We hav e consumerfacing relationships with a v ariety of other companies, including Apple, CVS, Disney, Lev i's, Starbucks, and Ulta Beauty. In addition, we hav e relationships with third-party companies that sell and ship items directly to guests through our digital channels. We also hav e relationships with designers, celebrities, influencers,  and  other  indiv iduals,  including  for  adv ertising  campaigns  and  marketing  programs.  If  consumers  hav e  negativ e  experiences  with,  or  v iew unfav orably, any of the companies or indiv iduals with whom we hav e relationships, it could cause them to not shop with us and negativ ely impact our results of operations.\n\n## If  we are unable to successfully develop, source, and market our owned and exclusive brand products, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nOur  owned  and  exclusiv e  brand  products  represent  approximately  one  third  of  our  ov erall  merchandise  sales  and  generally  carry  higher  margins  than equiv alent national brand products.  Our ability to source, dev elop, and market our owned and exclusiv e brands depends on many factors, including our ability  to  anticipate  consumer  demand  and  preferences  and  make  trend-right  decisions,  our  relationships  with  v endors,  the  av ailability  and  price  of  raw materials, product quality, and our ability to offer products at affordable prices. If we are unable to successfully dev elop, source, and market our owned and exclusiv e brands, or if we are unable to successfully protect our related intellectual property rights, our results of operations could be adv ersely affected. In addition, our reliance on owned and exclusiv e brand products may also amplify other risks discussed in this Item 1A, Risk Factors, because many of these products are imported and we are more inv olv ed in the dev elopment and sourcing of those products. For example, any failure of our owned brands to meet applicable safety standards or T arget's or our guests' expectations regarding safety, quality, supply chain transparency, and responsible sourcing could expose us to government enforcement actions and priv ate litigation, result in costly product recalls and other liabilities, and exacerbate our reputational risks. In addition, owned brand products generally need longer lead times between order placement and product deliv ery and require us to take ownership of those  products  earlier  in  the  supply  chain.  T his  requires  accurate  longer-term  forecasting  of  consumer  demand  to  effectiv ely  manage  our  operations, including  for  categories  where  consumer  preferences  may  change  rapidly,  and  exposes  us  to  enhanced  risks  of  supply  chain  disruptions.  We  hav e prev iously been, and may in the future be, unable to accurately predict consumer demand for our owned brand products. This has resulted, and may in the future result, in insufficient or excess inv entory, increased inv entory markdowns, and higher costs. Any of these outcomes could adv ersely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## If we are unable to protect against inventory shrink, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\nOur business depends on our ability to effectiv ely manage our inv entory.  We hav e historically experienced loss of inv entory (also called shrink) due to damage, theft (including from organized retail crime), and other causes. In recent years, we hav e experienced elev ated lev els of inv entory shrink relativ e to historical lev els, which hav e adv ersely affected, and could continue to adv ersely affect, our results of operations and financial condition. T o protect against rising inv entory shrink, we hav e taken, and may continue to take, certain operational and strategic actions that could adv ersely affect our reputation, guest experience,  and  results  of  operations.  In  addition,  sustained  high  rates  of  inv entory  shrink  at  certain  stores  hav e  contributed,  and  may  continue  to contribute, to the closure of certain stores and the impairment of long-term assets.\n\n## We depend on seasonal moments and higher-margin merchandise to drive sales and net earnings growth.\n\nOur business experiences some seasonality, with a larger portion of our sales traditionally occurring in the fourth quarter because it includes the Nov ember and December holiday sales period. In addition to the Nov ember and December holiday sales period, we also see increased sales activ ity during the backto-school and back-to-college period and other seasonal moments throughout the year. As a result, any factors negativ ely impacting us during any of these periods,  including  weather  conditions,  natural  disasters,  macroeconomic  conditions,  consumer  preferences,  and  political  or  economic  uncertainty  or instability, could adv ersely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe offer our guests a multi-category assortment of ev eryday essentials and differentiated merchandise. Howev er, we depend on sales of our higher-margin merchandise to driv e net earnings growth. As a result, flat sales and sales declines of our higher-margin merchandise hav e prev iously limited, and may in the future limit, our ability to driv e net earnings growth. Furthermore, we are subject to cyclical trends in consumer spending, which may\n\n2024 Form 10-K",

      "answer": "In 2023, MDLZ's chocolate business in Latin America benefited from the Ricolino acquisition, which added $507 million in net revenues on a constant currency basis. This acquisition, along with favorable volume/mix in other categories like gum and biscuits, contributed to an overall increase in net revenues for the year. However, in 2024, the chocolate segment became a driver of unfavorable volume/mix, reflecting volume declines primarily in Mexico and Argentina. These chocolate-related declines contributed to the overall unfavorable volume/mix trend in 2024, despite the earlier gains from the acquisition and prior-year performance.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - MDLZ's chocolate business in Latin America generated $1,003 million in net revenues in 2022.",

        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b - In 2024, chocolate was explicitly cited as a category contributing to unfavorable volume/mix in Latin America, primarily due to declines in Mexico and Argentina.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - While the Ricolino acquisition provided a boost to chocolate revenues in 2023, by 2024 the chocolate business had shifted to being a source of unfavorable volume/mix, indicating a reversal in performance that contributed to the broader regional decline."

Currency-related items were unfav orable, net of the adjustment for extreme pricing in Argentina, due to currency translation rate changes. Unfav orable currency translation impacts were primarily due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relativ e to most currencies in the region, primarily the Argentinean peso, Brazilian real, Mexican peso and Chilean peso, partially offset by the strength of a few currencies relativ e to the U.S. dollar, primarily the Colombian peso. Ov erall, unfav orable v olume/mix reflected v olume declines due to consumer softness, primarily in Mexico and Argentina, partially offset by fav orable product mix. Ov erall, unfav orable v olume/mix was driv en by declines in chocolate, candy, cheese &amp; grocery and refreshment bev erages, partially offset by gains in biscuits &amp; baked snacks and gum. Higher net pricing, net of the adjustment for extreme pricing in Argentina, was driv en by input cost-driv en pricing actions and reflected across all categories, primarily in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil.\n\nSegment operating income increased $3 million (0.6%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lower remeasurement loss on net monetary position, lower manufacturing  costs  driv en  by  productiv ity,  lower  acquisition  integration  costs  and  lower  other  selling,  general  and  administrativ e  expenses.  T hese fav orable  items  were  mostly  offset  by  higher  raw  material  costs,  unfav orable  currency-related  items,  unfav orable  v olume/mix,  higher  adv ertising  and consumer promotion costs, higher costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, costs incurred for the ERP Systems Implementation program and intangible asset impairment charges incurred in 2024.\n\n## 2023 compared with 2022\n\nNet rev enues increased $1,377 million (37.9%), due to higher net pricing (31.0 pp), the impact of acquisitions (14.0 pp) and fav orable v olume/mix (3.8 pp), partially offset by unfav orable currency (10.0 pp) and the impact of div estitures (0.9 pp). Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories, driv en primarily  by Argentina  as  well  as  Brazil  and  Mexico.  T he  Nov ember  1,  2022  acquisition  of  Ricolino  added  incremental  net  rev enues  of  $507  million (constant currency basis) through the one-year anniv ersary of the acquisition in 2023. Fav orable v olume/mix reflected strong v olume growth as the region continued  to  see  increased  demand  for  most  of  our  snack  category  products.  Fav orable  v olume/mix  was  driv en  by  gains  in  gum,  biscuits  &amp;  baked snacks, candy and cheese &amp; grocery, partially offset by declines in refreshment bev erages and chocolate. Unfav orable currency impacts were primarily due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relativ e to a few currencies in the region, primarily the Argentinean peso, partially offset by the strength of most currencies relativ e to the  U.S. dollar, primarily the  Mexican peso and  Brazilian real.  T he impact of our 2022 div estitures resulted in a year-ov er-year decline in net rev enues of $22 million.\n\nSegment  operating  income  increased  $141  million  (36.3%),  primarily  due  to  higher  net  pricing,  the  impact  of  our  Ricolino  acquisition,  fav orable volume/mix, lower manufacturing costs driv en by productiv ity and lapping prior year inv entory step-up charges. T hese fav orable items were partially offset by  higher  raw  material  costs,  higher  other  selling,  general  and  administrativ e  expenses,  higher  adv ertising  and  consumer  promotion  costs,  higher remeasurement loss on net monetary position and higher acquisition integration costs.",

      "answer": "The unfavorable volume/mix in the chocolate category in 2024 contributed to a drag on total net revenue growth, despite the company reporting an overall increase of $452 million. In 2023, chocolate contributed $10.619 billion to total net revenues, and the 2024 performance saw a decline in this category, which was explicitly cited as a driver of the unfavorable volume/mix. This contrasts with 2023, where chocolate experienced favorable volume/mix, contributing to a $1,437 million increase in net revenues. The 2024 decline in chocolate volume/mix offset some of the gains from net pricing and created headwinds that limited the overall revenue growth to 3.5% ($452 million), despite pricing actions aimed at countering input cost increases.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Chocolate net revenues in 2023 were $10,619 million.",

Specifically, the unfavorable volume/mix, driven by consumer softness in Mexico and Argentina, reduced net revenues. Although net pricing increased by 7.0 percentage points due to input cost-driven pricing actions across categories \u2014 particularly in Argentina, Mexico, and Brazil \u2014 and manufacturing costs were reduced through productivity improvements, these gains were largely offset by the drop in sales volume.

Segment Reporting\n\nWe manufacture and market primarily snack food products, including chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks, as well as gum &amp; candy, cheese &amp; grocery and powdered beverages.\n\nWe manage  our  global  business  and  report  operating  results  through  geographic  units.  We  manage  our  operations  by  region  to  lev erage  regional operating scale, manage different and changing business env ironments more effectiv ely and pursue growth opportunities as they arise across our key markets. Our regional management teams have responsibility for the business, product categories and financial results in the regions.\n\nOur operations and management structure are organized into four operating segments:\n\n- Latin America\n- AMEA\n- Europe\n- North America\n\nOur  Chief  Operating  Decision  Maker  (CODM)  is  our  Chief  Executiv e  Officer.  Our  CODM  uses  segment  operating  income  in  the  annual  plan  and forecasting process and considers actual v ersus plan v ariances in assessing the performance of the segment. The CODM also uses segment operating income as an input to the ov erall compensation measures for segment management under our incentiv e compensation plans. We believ e it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help inv estors analyze segment performance and trends. Segment operating income excludes unrealized gains and losses on hedging activ ities (which are a component of cost of sales), general corporate expenses (which are a component of selling, general and administrativ e expenses), amortization of intangible assets, gains and losses on div estitures and acquisitions and acquisition-related costs (which are a component of selling, general and administrativ e expenses) in all periods presented. We exclude these items from segment operating income in order to prov ide better transparency of our segment operating results. Furthermore, we centrally manage benefit plan non-serv ice income and interest and other expense, net. We do not present these items by segment because they are excluded from the segment profitability measure that our CODM rev iews. Additionally, assets for reportable segments are not disclosed as such information is not regularly rev iewed by the Company's CODM.",

Currency-related items were unfav orable, net of the adjustment for extreme pricing in Argentina, due to currency translation rate changes. Unfav orable currency translation impacts were primarily due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relativ e to most currencies in the region, primarily the Argentinean peso, Brazilian real, Mexican peso and Chilean peso, partially offset by the strength of a few currencies relativ e to the U.S. dollar, primarily the Colombian peso. Ov erall, unfav orable v olume/mix reflected v olume declines due to consumer softness, primarily in Mexico and Argentina, partially offset by fav orable product mix. Ov erall, unfav orable v olume/mix was driv en by declines in chocolate, candy, cheese &amp; grocery and refreshment bev erages, partially offset by gains in biscuits &amp; baked snacks and gum. Higher net pricing, net of the adjustment for extreme pricing in Argentina, was driv en by input cost-driv en pricing actions and reflected across all categories, primarily in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil.\n\nSegment operating income increased $3 million (0.6%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lower remeasurement loss on net monetary position, lower manufacturing  costs  driv en  by  productiv ity,  lower  acquisition  integration  costs  and  lower  other  selling,  general  and  administrativ e  expenses.  T hese fav orable  items  were  mostly  offset  by  higher  raw  material  costs,  unfav orable  currency-related  items,  unfav orable  v olume/mix,  higher  adv ertising  and consumer promotion costs, higher costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, costs incurred for the ERP Systems Implementation program and intangible asset impairment charges incurred in 2024.\n\n## 2023 compared with 2022\n\nNet rev enues increased $1,377 million (37.9%), due to higher net pricing (31.0 pp), the impact of acquisitions (14.0 pp) and fav orable v olume/mix (3.8 pp), partially offset by unfav orable currency (10.0 pp) and the impact of div estitures (0.9 pp). Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories, driv en primarily  by Argentina  as  well  as  Brazil  and  Mexico.  T he  Nov ember  1,  2022  acquisition  of  Ricolino  added  incremental  net  rev enues  of  $507  million (constant currency basis) through the one-year anniv ersary of the acquisition in 2023. Fav orable v olume/mix reflected strong v olume growth as the region continued  to  see  increased  demand  for  most  of  our  snack  category  products.  Fav orable  v olume/mix  was  driv en  by  gains  in  gum,  biscuits  &amp;  baked snacks, candy and cheese &amp; grocery, partially offset by declines in refreshment bev erages and chocolate. Unfav orable currency impacts were primarily due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relativ e to a few currencies in the region, primarily the Argentinean peso, partially offset by the strength of most currencies relativ e to the  U.S. dollar, primarily the  Mexican peso and  Brazilian real.  T he impact of our 2022 div estitures resulted in a year-ov er-year decline in net rev enues of $22 million.\n\nSegment  operating  income  increased  $141  million  (36.3%),  primarily  due  to  higher  net  pricing,  the  impact  of  our  Ricolino  acquisition,  fav orable volume/mix, lower manufacturing costs driv en by productiv ity and lapping prior year inv entory step-up charges. T hese fav orable items were partially offset by  higher  raw  material  costs,  higher  other  selling,  general  and  administrativ e  expenses,  higher  adv ertising  and  consumer  promotion  costs,  higher remeasurement loss on net monetary position and higher acquisition integration costs.",

      "answer": "The 2019 Incentive Plan required a proportional adjustment to outstanding RSUs and the total shares available under the plan following the 2024 special dividend. As a result of this adjustment, the number of outstanding RSUs increased by approximately 52,000, and an additional 128,000 RSU shares became available to be granted. This adjustment was based on a factor of 1.018, derived from the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, to the opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The 2019 Incentive Plan itself, filed as Exhibit 10.2 in the DEF 14 filing on December 17, 2019, formally documents the requirement for these adjustments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The 2024 special dividend triggered an adjustment under the 2019 Incentive Plan, increasing outstanding RSUs by approximately 52,000 and the available shares by 128,000. The adjustment factor was 1.018, based on the price change from $674.62 to $662.70.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Exhibit 10.2, filed under DEF 14 on December 17, 2019, is the formal documentation of the 2019 Incentive Plan, which includes the proportional adjustment provisions.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The adjustment mechanism in the 2019 Incentive Plan directly led to increases in both outstanding RSUs and available shares after the special dividend, and this requirement is documented in the DEF 14 filing."

      "answer": "Costco's production of private-label items through its owned processing, packaging, and manufacturing facilities enables tighter control over product costs, which supports its strategy to maintain competitive pricing. This operational capability allows Costco to absorb or mitigate some cost increases internally rather than passing them fully to members, as stated in the MD&A section. By leveraging these facilities, which include those for producing private-label items, Costco can reduce reliance on third-party suppliers and manage input costs more effectively. This contributes to its ability to maintain a perception of 'pricing authority' and manage gross margin pressures, even in the face of inflationary or competitive challenges.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Costco emphasizes maintaining 'pricing authority' by offering competitive values and may absorb cost increases to avoid raising prices, which affects gross margin.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Costco operates various processing, packaging, and manufacturing facilities, which are used to support its business, including the production of private-label items.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The presence of internal production facilities for private-label items allows Costco to manage cost increases more effectively, aligning with its pricing strategy to maintain competitive prices while mitigating gross margin impacts."

      "question": "How did the issuance and partial repayment of the Guaranteed Senior Notes by Costco's Japanese subsidiary in 2023 and 2024, respectively, affect the company's overall long-term debt fair value and financing activities during that period?",
      "answer": "The issuance of four Guaranteed Senior Notes totaling approximately $500 by Costco's Japanese subsidiary in November 2023 increased the company's long-term debt. However, in July 2024, the subsidiary repaid $77 of these notes, reducing the outstanding amount. As a result, the fair value of Costco's long-term debt decreased from $5,738 at the end of 2023 to $5,412 at the end of 2024. Additionally, the financing activities section shows that the issuance of these notes contributed to the $10,764 net cash used in financing activities during 2024, which also included the repayment of $1,000 in principal on the 2.750% Senior Notes.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - In November 2023, Costco's Japanese subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes totaling approximately $500, with fixed interest rates ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. In July 2024, $77 of these notes were repaid.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - The fair value of long-term debt was $5,738 at the end of 2023 and $5,412 at the end of 2024.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b - Net cash used in financing activities totaled $10,764 in 2024, which included the repayment of $1,000 in principal on the 2.750% Senior Notes and the issuance of the $500 in Guaranteed Senior Notes by the Japanese subsidiary.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The issuance of $500 in Guaranteed Senior Notes increased long-term debt, but the subsequent repayment of $77 and the $1,000 repayment of other Senior Notes contributed to the overall decrease in long-term debt fair value from $5,738 to $5,412. These financing activities also contributed to the $10,764 net cash used in financing activities in 2024."

      "answer": "Costco has consistently renewed W. Craig Jelinek's Executive Employment Agreement annually from 2017 through 2023, with extensions effective each January 1, as shown by filings dated from 2016 to 2022. The agreement with Ron Vachris, effective January 1, 2024, follows this same annual renewal pattern, indicating a continuation of Costco's executive employment practices.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The Executive Employment Agreement with Ron Vachris is effective January 1, 2024, and was filed on 11/26/2023 (Exhibit 10.9*).",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - W. Craig Jelinek's Executive Employment Agreement was extended annually from 2017 to 2023, with each extension filed in November of the prior year (e.g., 10.5.5* filed 11/20/2022 for the 2023 term).",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both executives have agreements effective on January 1 of each year, and the filings occur in November or December of the prior year, showing a consistent renewal mechanism across time."

      "answer": "Altria faces significant regulatory risks regarding its $1.7 billion investment in JUUL, as outlined in the 2022 10-K filing. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has issued an administrative complaint alleging that Altria's 35% investment in JUUL and associated agreements violate antitrust laws by constituting an unreasonable restraint of trade and substantially lessening competition. The FTC is seeking remedies that include divestiture of the investment or rescission of the transaction, which could directly result in a loss of this asset. This risk is compounded by the fact that such regulatory actions could negatively impact Altria's credit ratings, increase financing costs, and hinder its ability to achieve strategic and financial objectives, including anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings from the investment.",

The tobacco industry competes for talent with the consumer products industry and other companies that may enjoy greater societal acceptance and fewer longer-term challenges. As a result, we may be unable to attract and retain the best talent. In addition, our ability to retain the best talent may be adversely affected by current labor market dynamics in which the number of U.S. workers leaving their jobs increased significantly. Failure to attract and retain the best talent could adversely affect Altria's ability to achieve its Vision.\n\n## Altria may be required to write down intangible assets, including goodwill, due to impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.\n\nWe periodically calculate the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets to test for impairment. This calculation may be affected by several factors, including general economic conditions (such as continued uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic), regulatory developments, changes in category growth rates as a result of changing adult tobacco consumer preferences, success of planned new product expansions, competitive activity and income and excise taxes. Certain events also can trigger an immediate review of intangible assets. If an impairment is determined to exist in either situation, we will incur impairment losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. For further discussion, see Discussion and Analysis Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Item 7.\n\n## Risks Related to the Capital Markets and Financing\n\n## Acquisitions or other events may adversely affect Altria's credit rating, and Altria may not achieve its anticipated strategic or financial objectives of a transaction.\n\nFrom time to time, Altria considers acquisitions, investments or dispositions and may engage in confidential negotiations that are not publicly announced unless and until those negotiations result in a definitive agreement. Although we seek to maintain or improve our credit ratings over time, it is possible that completing a given acquisition, investment, disposition or the occurrence of other events could negatively impact our investment grade credit ratings or the outlook for those ratings as occurred following our investment in JUUL. Any such change in ratings or outlook may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and also may increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate. Furthermore, acquisition opportunities are limited, and acquisitions present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration, strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings. There can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or an investment. Additionally, there can be no assurance that we will be able to dispose of our businesses or investments on favorable terms, which may result in a loss in our consolidated statements of earnings (losses).\n\n## Disruption and uncertainty in the credit and capital markets could adversely affect Altria's access to these markets, earnings and dividend rate.\n\nAccess to the credit and capital markets is important for us to satisfy our liquidity and financing needs. For example, we typically access the commercial paper market early in the second quarter to help fund payments under the Master Settlement Agreement (the 'MSA') tax obligations and shareholder dividends. Disruption and uncertainty in these markets and any resulting adverse impact on credit availability, pricing, credit terms or credit rating may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and may also increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate.\n\n## Altria may be unable to attract investors due to the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage.\n\nThere is increasing investor focus on environmental, social and governance ('ESG') matters. Organizations that provide ESG information to investors have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Decreasing social acceptance of tobacco products or unfavorable ESG ratings may lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward Altria, which could result in shareholders choosing to divest their ownership in Altria stock or potential investors choosing not to invest in Altria stock and could have a negative impact on the market performance of Altria stock.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Investments\n\n## A challenge to our investment in JUUL, if successful, could result in a broad range of resolutions, including divestiture of the investment or rescission of the transaction.\n\nA challenge to our investment in JUUL, if successful, could result in a broad range of resolutions such as divestiture of the investment or rescission of the transaction. In April 2020, the FTC issued an administrative complaint against Altria and JUUL alleging that Altria's 35% investment in JUUL and the associated agreements constitute an unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act and Section 5 of the FTC Act, and substantially lessened competition in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act. The FTC seeks a broad range of remedies, including divestiture of Altria's investment in JUUL, rescission of the transaction and prohibition against any officer or director of either Altria or JUUL serving on the other's board of directors or attending meetings.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nat December 31, 2020 was $1.1 billion (carrying value of $1.0 billion), which exceeded its carrying value by approximately 8% at December 31, 2020.\n\nIn September 2021, the fair value of Altria's equity method investment in Cronos declined below its carrying value (by approximately 2% as of September 30, 2021) and had not recovered as of December 31, 2021. Accounting guidance requires the evaluation of the following factors when determining if the decline in fair value is other than temporary: (i) the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline; (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee; and (iii) the investor's intent and ability to hold its equity method investment until full recovery to its carrying value in the near-term. In preparing its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, Altria evaluated these factors and determined that there was not sufficient evidence to conclude that the impairment was temporary. As a result, Altria recorded a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge of $205 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was recorded to (income) losses from equity investments in its consolidated statement of earnings (losses). The impairment charge reflects the difference between the fair value of Altria's equity method investment in Cronos using Cronos's share price at December 31, 2021 and the carrying value of Altria's equity method investment in Cronos at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2021, prior to recording the impairment charge, the fair value of Altria's equity method investment in Cronos was less than its carrying value by approximately 25%. After recording the impairment charge, the fair value and carrying value of Altria's equity method investment in Cronos at December 31, 2021 were $617 million.\n\nAt February 22, 2022, the fair value of Altria's equity method investment in Cronos was $524 million, which was less than its carrying value by approximately 15%. Altria will continue to assess the fair value of its equity method investment in Cronos to determine if any decline in fair value below its carrying value is other than temporary.\n\nFor further discussion of Altria's investments in ABI, JUUL and Cronos, see Note 6.\n\n- Marketing Costs: Altria's businesses promote their products with consumer incentives, trade promotions and consumer engagement programs. These consumer incentive and trade promotion activities, which include discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives, do not create a distinct deliverable and are, therefore, recorded as a reduction of revenues. Consumer engagement program payments are made to third parties. Altria's businesses expense these consumer engagement programs, which include event marketing, as incurred and such expenses are included in marketing, administration and research costs in Altria's consolidated statements of earnings (losses). For interim reporting purposes, Altria's businesses charge consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses to operations as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n- Contingencies: As discussed in Note 18 and Item 3, legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions against Altria and its subsidiaries, including PM USA and UST and its subsidiaries, as well as their respective indemnitees and Altria's investees. In 1998, PM USA and certain other U.S. tobacco product manufacturers entered into the MSA with 46 states and various other governments and jurisdictions to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. PM USA and certain other U.S. tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota (together with the MSA, the 'State Settlement Agreements'). PM USA's portion of ongoing adjusted payments and legal fees is based on its relative share of the settling manufacturers' domestic cigarette shipments, including roll-your-own cigarettes, in the year preceding that in which the payment is due. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. Payments under the State Settlement Agreements and the FDA user fees are based on variable factors, such as volume, operating income, market share and inflation, depending on the subject payment. Altria's subsidiaries account for the cost of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees as a component of cost of sales. Altria's subsidiaries recorded approximately $4.6 billion and $4.7 billion of charges to cost of sales for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees.\n\nAltria and its subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when they determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. At the present time, while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, except to the extent discussed in Note 18 and Item 3: (i) management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any pending litigation; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in any pending case; and (iii) accordingly, management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes, if any. Litigation defense costs are expensed as incurred and included in marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings (losses).\n\n- Employee Benefit Plans: Altria provides a range of benefits to certain employees and retired employees, including pension, postretirement health care and postemployment benefits. Altria records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by GAAP, which include various actuarial assumptions as to discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets, mortality, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. Altria reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so. Any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods.\n\nAltria recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet and records as a component of other comprehensive earnings (losses), net of deferred income taxes, the gains or losses and prior service",

See Smoking and Health Litigation - Other Smoking and Health Class Actions above for a discussion of these proceedings. See Guarantees and Other Similar Matters below for a discussion of the Distribution Agreement between Altria and PMI that provides for indemnities for certain liabilities concerning tobacco products.\n\nSettlements of Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation: In November 1998, PM USA and certain other tobacco product manufacturers entered into the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement (the 'MSA') with 46 states, the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. PM USA and certain other tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota (together with the MSA, the 'State Settlement Agreements'). The State Settlement Agreements require that the original participating manufacturers or 'OPMs' (now PM USA, R.J. Reynolds and, with respect to certain brands, ITG Brands, LLC ('ITG')) make annual payments of approximately $9.4 billion, subject to adjustments for several factors, including inflation, market share and industry volume. In addition, the OPMs are required to pay settling plaintiffs' attorneys' fees, subject to an annual cap of $500 million; these quarterly payments are expected to end in 2024. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the aggregate amount recorded in cost of sales with respect to the State Settlement Agreements was approximately $4.3 billion, $4.4 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively. These amounts include PM USA's estimate of amounts related to NPM Adjustments discussed below.\n\nNPM Adjustment Disputes: The 'NPM Adjustment' is a reduction in MSA payments made by the OPMs and those manufacturers that are subsequent signatories to the MSA (collectively, the 'participating manufacturers' or 'PMs') that applies if the PMs collectively lose at least a specified level of market share to non-participating manufacturers since 1997, subject to certain conditions and defenses.\n\nThe independent auditor ('IA') appointed under the MSA has calculated that PM USA's share of the maximum potential NPM Adjustments for 2004-2020 is (exclusive of interest or earnings): $388 million for 2004; $181 million for 2005; $154 million for 2006; $185 million for 2007; $250 million for 2008; $211 million for 2009; $218 million for 2010; $166 million for 2011; $214 million for 2012; $224 million for 2013; $258 million for 2014; $313 million for 2015; $292 million for 2016; $302 million for 2017; $325 million for 2018; $444 million for 2019; and $572 million for 2020. These maximum amounts will be reduced, likely substantially, to reflect the NPM Adjustment settlements discussed below, and potentially for current and future calculation disputes and other developments. In addition, PM USA's recovery of these amounts, even as reduced, is dependent upon subsequent determinations regarding state-specific defenses and disputes with other PMs.\n\n## Settlements of NPM Adjustment Disputes.\n\n- Multi-State Settlement . By the end of 2018, PM USA entered into a multi-state settlement of NPM Adjustment disputes with a total of 36 MSA states and territories in which PM USA settled the NPM Adjustment disputes through 2022 with 35 of the 36 states, and through 2024 with one state. Pursuant to the multi-state settlement, PM USA received $1.03 billion and expects to receive approximately $320 million in credits to offset PM USA's MSA payments through 2029.\n- New York Settlement. In 2015, PM USA entered into a separate NPM Adjustment settlement with New York in which PM USA settled the NPM Adjustment disputes with New York in perpetuity. PM USA received $373 million pursuant to the New York settlement and expects to receive annual credits applied against the MSA payments due to New York going forward.\n- Montana Settlement . In 2020, PM USA entered into a separate NPM Adjustment settlement with Montana in which PM USA settled the NPM Adjustment disputes with Montana through 2030. This settlement resulted in a payment by PM USA of $4 million.\n\n## Continuing NPM Adjustment Disputes with States That Have Not Settled.\n\n- 2004 NPM Adjustment. The PMs and the 10 states that have not settled the NPM Adjustment disputes are currently arbitrating NPM Adjustment disputes for 2004 in a multi-state arbitration. Hearings for nine of the 10 states have concluded. In September 2021, the arbitration panels issued decisions finding that two states, Missouri and Washington, were not diligent in their enforcement of their escrow statutes in 2004 and, therefore, are subject to the NPM adjustment for 2004. The arbitration panels further found that the remaining seven states were diligent in their enforcement and, therefore, are not subject to the NPM adjustment for 2004. The hearing for one remaining state is currently scheduled for February 2022. The two states determined by the arbitration panel to be non-diligent have filed motions in applicable state courts and with the arbitration panels challenging these determinations and several issues remain to be resolved by the arbitration panels that will affect the final amount of the 2004 NPM adjustment PM USA and other PMs will receive. PM USA recorded $21 million as a reduction to cost of sales in the third quarter of 2021 for its estimate of the minimum amount of the 2004 NPM adjustment it will receive. PM USA estimates it is entitled to interest of approximately $23 million in connection with the 2004 NPM adjustment, which it recorded as interest income in the third quarter of 2021.\n- 2005-2007 NPM Adjustments. The PMs and the 10 states that have not settled the NPM Adjustment disputes are currently arbitrating NPM Adjustment disputes before a single arbitration panel. The arbitration encompasses three years, 2005-2007, for nine of the 10 states, and one year, 2005, for one state. As of January 24, 2022, no decisions have resulted from the arbitration.\n- Subsequent Years. No assurance can be given as to when proceedings for 2008 and subsequent years will be scheduled or the precise form those proceedings will take.",

These settlements require participating manufacturers to make substantial annual payments, which are adjusted for several factors, including inflation, operating income, market share and industry volume. Increases in inflation can increase our financial liability under the State Settlement Agreements. The State Settlement Agreements' inflation calculations require us to apply the higher of 3% or the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers ('CPI-U') percentage rate as published in January of each year. As of December 2021, the inflation calculation was approximately 7% based on the latest CPI-U data; however, the increase in the annual payments did not have a material impact on Altria's financial position. Altria believes that inflation will continue at increased levels in 2022, but does not expect the corresponding increase in annual payments to result in a material financial impact. However, we will continue to monitor conditions related to the impact of increased inflation on the macroeconomic environment.\n\nFor a discussion of the impact of the State Settlement Agreements on Altria, see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation below and Note 18. The State Settlement Agreements also place numerous requirements and restrictions on participating manufacturers' business operations, including prohibitions and restrictions on the advertising and marketing of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products. Among these are prohibitions of outdoor and transit brand advertising, payments for product placement and free sampling (except in adult-only facilities). The State Settlement Agreements also place restrictions on the use of brand name sponsorships and brand name non-tobacco products and prohibitions on targeting youth and the use of cartoon characters. In addition, the State Settlement Agreements require companies to affirm corporate principles directed at reducing underage use of cigarettes; impose requirements regarding lobbying activities; limit the industry's ability to challenge certain tobacco control and underage use laws; and provide for the dissolution of certain tobacco-related organizations and place restrictions on the establishment of any replacement organizations.\n\nIn November 1998, USSTC entered into the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (the 'STMSA') with the attorneys general of various states and United States territories to resolve the remaining health care cost reimbursement cases initiated against USSTC. The STMSA required USSTC to adopt various marketing and advertising restrictions. USSTC is the only smokeless tobacco manufacturer to sign the STMSA.\n\n## Other International, Federal, State and Local Regulation and Governmental and Private Activity\n\n- International, Federal, State and Local Regulation: Various states and localities have enacted or proposed legislation that imposes restrictions on tobacco products (including cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, cigars, e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouches), such as legislation that (i) prohibits the sale of all tobacco products or certain tobacco categories, such as e-vapor, (ii) prohibits the sale of tobacco products with characterizing flavors, such as menthol cigarettes and flavored e-vapor products, (iii) requires the disclosure of health information separate from or in addition to federally mandated health warnings and (iv) restricts commercial speech or imposes additional restrictions on the marketing or sale of tobacco products. The legislation varies in terms of the type of tobacco products, the conditions under which such products are or would be restricted or prohibited, and exceptions to the restrictions or prohibitions. For example, a number of proposals involving characterizing flavors would prohibit smokeless tobacco products with characterizing flavors without providing an exception for mint- or wintergreen-flavored products. As of February 22, 2022, multiple states and localities are considering legislation to ban flavors in one or more tobacco products, and six states (California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Utah, New York and Illinois) and the District of Columbia have passed such legislation. Some of these states, such as New York, Utah and Illinois, exempt certain products that have received FDA market authorization through the PMTA pathway.\n\nThe legislation in California bans the sale of most tobacco products with characterizing flavors, including menthol, mint and wintergreen. Following enactment of the flavor ban in August 2020, several registered California voters filed a referendum against the legislation. In January 2021 the requisite number of registered California voters signed a petition to place the question of whether the legislation should be affirmed or overturned on the next statewide general election ballot, which will likely take place in November 2022, unless a special statewide election is called earlier. As a result, the implementation of the legislation is delayed until after a vote on the referendum occurs.\n\nMassachusetts passed legislation capping the amount of nicotine in e-vapor products. Similar legislation is pending in one other state.\n\nRestrictions on e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products also have been instituted or proposed internationally.\n\nAltria's tobacco operating companies have challenged and will continue to challenge certain federal, state and local legislation and other governmental action, including through litigation. It is possible, however, that legislation, regulation or other governmental action could be enacted or implemented that could have a material adverse impact on the business and volume of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees, and the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL. Such action also could negatively impact adult smokers' transition to these products, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve our Vision.",

Equity method investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting are reported at cost and adjusted each period for Altria's share of (income) losses and dividends paid, if any. Altria reports its share of ABI's and Cronos's results using a one-quarter lag because results are not available in time for Altria to record them in the concurrent period. Altria reviews its equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of its investments to their carrying value. If the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary, the investment is considered impaired and reduced to fair value, and the impairment is recognized in the period identified. The factors used to make this determination include the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, and Altria's intent and ability to hold its investment until recovery.\n\nFollowing Share Conversion (as defined in Note 6. Investments in Equity Securities ) in the fourth quarter of 2020, Altria elected to account for its equity investment in JUUL under the fair value option. Under this option, any cash dividends received and any changes in the fair value of the equity investment in JUUL, which is calculated quarterly using level 3 fair value measurements, are included in (income) losses from equity investments in the consolidated statements of earnings (losses). The fair value of the equity investment in JUUL is included in investments in equity securities on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Prior to Altria exercising its right to convert its non-voting shares to voting shares, Altria accounted for its investment in JUUL as an investment in an equity security. Since the JUUL shares did not have a readily determinable fair value, Altria elected to measure its investment in JUUL at its cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.\n\n- Litigation Contingencies and Costs: Altria and its subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when it is determined that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Litigation defense costs are expensed as incurred and included in marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings (losses). See Note 18. Contingencies .\n- Marketing Costs: Altria's businesses promote their products with consumer incentives, trade promotions and consumer engagement programs. These consumer incentive and trade promotion activities, which include discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives, do not create a distinct deliverable and are, therefore, recorded as a reduction of revenues. Consumer engagement program payments are made to third parties. Altria's businesses expense these consumer engagement programs, which include event marketing, as incurred and such expenses are included in marketing, administration and research costs in Altria's consolidated statements of earnings (losses). For interim reporting purposes, Altria's businesses charge consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses to operations as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n- Revenue Recognition: Altria's businesses generate substantially all of their revenue from sales contracts with customers. While Altria's businesses enter into separate sales contracts with each customer for each product type, all sales contracts are similarly structured. These contracts create an obligation to transfer product to the customer. All performance obligations are satisfied within one year; therefore, costs to obtain contracts are expensed as incurred and unsatisfied performance obligations are not disclosed. There is no financing component because Altria's businesses expect, at contract inception, that the period between when Altria's businesses transfer product to the customer and when the customer pays for that product will be one year or less.\n\nAltria's businesses define net revenues as revenues, which include excise taxes and shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of cash discounts for prompt payment, sales returns (also referred to as returned goods) and sales incentives. Altria's businesses exclude from the transaction price sales taxes and value-added taxes imposed at the time of sale.\n\nAltria's businesses recognize revenues from sales contracts with customers upon shipment of goods when control of such products is obtained by the customer. Altria's businesses determine that a customer obtains control of the product upon shipment when title of such product and risk of loss transfers to the customer. Altria's businesses account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs and such amounts are classified as part of cost of sales in Altria's consolidated statements of earnings (losses). Altria's businesses record an allowance for returned goods, based principally on historical volume and return rates, which is included in other accrued liabilities on Altria's consolidated balance sheets. Altria's businesses record sales incentives, which consist of consumer incentives and trade promotion activities, as a reduction to revenues (a portion of which is based on amounts estimated as being due to wholesalers, retailers and consumers at the end of a period) based principally on historical volume, utilization and redemption rates. Expected payments for sales incentives are included in accrued marketing liabilities on Altria's consolidated balance sheets.\n\nPayment terms vary depending on product type. Altria's businesses consider payments received in advance of product shipment as deferred revenue, which is included in other accrued liabilities on Altria's consolidated balance sheets until revenue is recognized. PM USA receives payment in advance of a customer obtaining control of the product.

This reflects Colgate's broader intangible asset valuation strategy, which involves using both income and market approaches to estimate fair value and requires significant management judgment regarding future cash flows, discount rates, and brand life expectancy. The Filorga reporting unit's fair value approximates its carrying value, indicating a close alignment between market expectations and book value for this unit.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Filorga is mentioned as one of the skin health product brands under the Personal Care segment, which accounted for 19% of Colgate's total worldwide Net sales in 2023.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The carrying value of goodwill associated with the Filorga reporting unit is $221 million as of December 31, 2023.",

The mention of Filorga's fair value approximating its carrying value provides context for how Colgate evaluates and manages its intangible assets."

      "answer": "In 2023, Colgate-Palmolive experienced a decrease in goodwill of $19 million due to foreign currency translation in the Africa/Eurasia region, bringing the ending goodwill balance to $88 million from $107 million. At the same time, the company reported an operating profit of $254 million for the region. Capital expenditures in Africa/Eurasia totaled $10 million in 2023. Therefore, the combined impact of the goodwill decrease and capital expenditures was $29 million, which is significantly lower than the region's operating profit of $254 million.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, extract the change in goodwill for Africa/Eurasia: Beginning goodwill balance was $107 million and ending balance was $88 million, indicating a decrease of $19 million due to foreign currency translation.",

      "answer": "The absence of contingent features in PMI's derivative instruments enhances the predictability of earnings because it eliminates the risk of unexpected cash requirements or adjustments triggered by specific events. Since PMI expects $78 million of derivative gains to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive losses to the consolidated statement of earnings within 12 months, and these gains are not subject to contingent features that could alter their value or timing, the company can more reliably forecast the impact of these reclassifications on future earnings. This predictability is further supported by PMI's active monitoring of credit risk and use of collateral, which limits exposure to counterparty nonperformance.",

PMI evaluates the performance of its geographical segments based on regional operating income, which excludes Swedish Match and Wellness and Healthcare products.

Other immaterial transactions have also occurred or been announced.\n\n## Asda\n\nIn February 2021, the Company completed the divestiture of Asda, the Company's retail operations in the U.K., for net consideration of $9.6 billion. Upon closing of the transaction, the Company recorded an incremental pre-tax loss of $0.2 billion in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily related to changes in the net assets of the disposal group, currency exchange rate fluctuations and customary purchase price adjustments upon closing. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company deconsolidated the financial statements of Asda and recognized its retained investment in Asda as a debt security within other long-term assets and also recognized certain legal and tax indemnity liabilities within deferred income taxes and other on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nAsda was classified as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2021, and as a result, the Company recognized an estimated pre-tax loss of $5.5 billion in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Upon classifying the Asda disposal group as held for sale, $2.3 billion of accumulated pension components associated with the expected derecognition of the Asda pension plan were included as part of the loss. In calculating the loss, the fair value of the disposal group was reduced by approximately $0.8 billion related to the estimated fair value of certain indemnities and other transaction related costs.\n\n## Seiyu\n\nIn March 2021, the Company completed the divestiture of Seiyu, the Company's retail operations in Japan, for net consideration of $1.2 billion. Upon closing of the transaction, the Company recorded an incremental pre-tax loss of $0.2 billion in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily related to changes in the net assets of the disposal group, currency exchange rate fluctuations and customary purchase price adjustments upon closing. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company deconsolidated the financial statements of Seiyu and recognized its retained 15 percent ownership interest in Seiyu as an equity investment within other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nSeiyu was classified as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2021, and as a result, the Company recognized an estimated pre-tax loss of $1.9 billion in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\n\nAssets and liabilities held for sale associated with the Asda and Seiyu disposal groups as of January 31, 2021 were as follows:\n\n",

Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges.\n\nUpon completing the sales of Asda in February 2021 and Seiyu in March 2021, the Company recorded incremental non-recurring impairment charges of $0.4 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 within other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 12. The Company did not have other material assets or liabilities resulting in nonrecurring fair value measurements as of January 31, 2022.\n\nFor the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, the Company's operations in Argentina, Japan and the U.K. met the held for sale criteria in fiscal 2021, as further discussed in Note 12. As a result, the individual disposal groups were measured at fair value, less costs to sell, which is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement based on each transaction's expected consideration. The carrying value of the Argentina, Japan and U.K. disposal groups exceeded their fair value, less costs to sell, and as a result, the Company recognized non-recurring impairment charges. The aggregate pre-tax loss of $8.3 billion associated with the divestiture of these operations in the Walmart International segment was recorded in other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended January 31, 2021 and included these impairment charges as well as a $2.3 billion charge related to the Asda pension plan. These impairment charges included the anticipated release of non-cash cumulative foreign currency translation losses associated with the disposal groups. Other impairment charges for assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during fiscal 2021 were immaterial.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive uses selling price increases as part of its strategy to manage foreign exchange risk, alongside derivative contracts such as forward and swap contracts, option contracts, and local currency borrowings. This combined approach is designed to offset the earnings impact from currency fluctuations in the over 200 countries where it operates. Specifically, the company aims to mitigate the impact of foreign currency rate movements on its net sales and costs, which could otherwise be significantly affected due to translation of foreign subsidiary assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars and the volatility of exchange rates.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Colgate-Palmolive uses selling price increases as one of several techniques (alongside derivative contracts) to manage foreign exchange risk, and it operates in over 200 countries and territories.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The company translates foreign subsidiary assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates, with translation gains and losses accumulated in equity, and it specifically uses foreign currency contracts with durations generally not exceeding 12 months to hedge exposures.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The use of selling price increases and derivative contracts are complementary strategies to manage the financial impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on earnings, especially given the broad geographic footprint and the exposure from translating foreign operations into U.S. dollars."

Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments\n\nThe Company uses available market information and other valuation methodologies in assessing the fair value of financial instruments. Judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value and, accordingly, changes in assumptions or the estimation methodologies may affect the fair value estimates. The Company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material, as it is the Company's policy to contract only with diverse, credit-worthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations.\n\nThe Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, sourcing strategies, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Company's treasury and risk management policies, which prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose. It is the Company's policy to enter into derivative instrument contracts with terms that match the underlying exposure being hedged. Provided below are details of the Company's exposures by type of risk and derivative instruments by type of hedge designation.\n\n## Valuation Considerations\n\nThe Company's derivative instruments include foreign currency contracts and commodity contracts. The fair value of these instruments are classified as follows:\n\nLevel 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.\n\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity's own assumptions.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk\n\nAs the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, sourcing strategies, selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements.\n\nThe Company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward and swap contracts, option contracts, foreign and local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities arising in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates (Level 2 valuation).\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nThe Company manages its targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The Company utilizes forward-starting interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of variability in interest rates for future debt issuances. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates (Level 2 valuation).",

Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Company's treasury and risk management policies. The Company's treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose.\n\nSee Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 6, Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk\n\nAs the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, sourcing strategies, selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements. See 'Results of Operations' above for a discussion of the foreign exchange impact on Net sales in each operating segment.\n\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end ex change rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders' equity. Income and expense items are translated into U.S. dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.\n\nThe Company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward and swap contracts, option contracts, foreign and local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its ex posures relating to foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nThe Company manages its mix of fixed and floating rate debt against its target with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The Company utilizes forward-starting interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of variability in interest rates for future debt issuances. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates.\n\nBased on year-end 2024 variable rate debt levels, a 1% increase in interest rates would have increased Interest expense by $3 in 2024.\n\n## Commodity Price Risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production, such as resins, essential oils, tropical oils, pulp, tallow, corn, poultry and soybeans. The Company manages its raw material ex posures through a combination of cost containment measures, ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts. Futures contracts are used on a limited basis, primarily in the Hill's Pet Nutrition segment, to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive accounts for pension enhancements differently from other Employee-Related Costs such as severance and termination benefits. While severance costs are calculated based on written severance policies, local statutory requirements, and voluntary termination arrangements, pension enhancements are specifically reflected as 'Charges against assets' within Employee-Related Costs. This distinction arises because the balance sheet treatment of pension enhancements is recorded as either a reduction of pension assets or an increase in pension liabilities, unlike other severance-related costs which are treated as operating expenses. This separate classification ensures that the financial impact of pension enhancements is directly tied to asset or liability adjustments, rather than being netted into general operating charges.",

Risk Factors,' 'Our Business Risks' and  Note  1  to  our  consolidated  financial  statements  for  further  information  related  to  the  impact  of  the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results.\n\nAs of December 25, 2021, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency controls or currency exchange restrictions were not material.\n\nThe TCJ Act imposed a one-time mandatory transition tax on undistributed international earnings, including $18.9 billion held in our consolidated subsidiaries outside the United States as of December 30, 2017. As of December 25, 2021, our mandatory transition tax liability was $2.9 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act; we currently expect to pay approximately $309 million of this liability in 2022. Any additional guidance issued by the IRS may impact our recorded amounts for this transition tax liability. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the TCJ Act.\n\nAs part of our evolving market practices, we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, which include the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with a majority of our suppliers generally  range  from  60  to  90  days,  which  we  deem  to  be  commercially  reasonable. We  will  continue  to monitor economic conditions and market practice working with our suppliers to adjust as necessary. We also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating global financial institutions. Under these agreements, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, may elect to sell their accounts receivable with PepsiCo  to  these  participating  global  financial  institutions.  Supplier  participation  in  these  financing arrangements  is  voluntary.  Our  suppliers  negotiate  their  financing  agreements  directly  with  the  respective global financial institutions and we are not a party to these agreements. These financing arrangements allow participating  suppliers  to  leverage  PepsiCo's  creditworthiness  in  establishing  credit  spreads  and  associated costs, which generally provides our suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. Neither PepsiCo nor any of its subsidiaries provide any guarantees to any third party in connection with these financing arrangements. We have no economic interest in our suppliers' decision to participate in these agreements. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted.

      "answer": "The ITC's final determination that NJOY ACE infringes on JUUL's patents could result in a material non-cash impairment of Altria's e-vapor reporting unit in future periods. In the 2024 financial statements, Altria disclosed that a hypothetical 1% increase in the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the e-vapor reporting unit would have led to an impairment charge of approximately $125 million during 2024. Given that the ITC determination introduces new uncertainty and potential constraints on the e-vapor product line, it could negatively impact future revenue projections and increase risk, potentially triggering a revaluation that leads to a significant impairment charge.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, the ITC issued a final determination regarding NJOY ACE's patent infringement, which could result in a material non-cash impairment of the e-vapor reporting unit.",

        "Step 3: From evidence_source_b, Altria filed a motion for reconsideration of the ITC's determination, indicating that the outcome has material implications for the e-vapor business unit.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize: The ITC determination introduces regulatory and financial risk to the e-vapor reporting unit, and based on prior sensitivity analysis, even small changes in assumptions can lead to significant impairment charges. Therefore, the ITC's decision could lead to a future impairment of approximately $125 million or more, depending on the revised projections and discount assumptions."

We concluded that the expected impact from the sales volume declines on the Skoal trademark represented a triggering event, and as a result of this conclusion, we performed an interim impairment assessment as of June 30, 2024. As a result of (i) lower projected revenue and income due to lower volume assumptions, (ii) a decrease in the perpetual growth rate to 0% (1% at October 1, 2023 valuation) and (iii) an increase in the discount rate to 11.5% (11.0% at October 1, 2023 valuation), we determined the estimated fair value of the Skoal trademark as of June 30, 2024, was below its carrying value and recorded a non-cash, pre-tax impairment of $354 million during the second quarter of 2024, which was recorded in our consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024. Our estimate of the fair value and carrying value of the Skoal trademark at June 30, 2024 was $3.6 billion after recording the impairment.\n\nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted in no impairment charges. Based on our 2024 annual impairment test, the estimated fair values of the e-vapor reporting unit and Skoal trademark exceeded their carrying values by approximately 28% ($0.3 billion) and 7% ($0.3 billion), respectively. A hypothetical 1% increase to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the e-vapor reporting unit would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately $125 million during 2024. A hypothetical 1% increase to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the Skoal trademark would have resulted in an additional impairment charge of approximately $85 million during 2024. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no accumulated impairment losses related to goodwill.\n\nWe use an income approach to estimate the fair values of our reporting units and trademarks. The income approach reflects the discounting of expected future cash flows at a rate of return that incorporates the risk-free rate for the use of those funds, the ex pected rate of inflation and the risk associated with realizing ex pected future cash flows.\n\nIn determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and trademarks in 2024, 2023 and 2022, we made various judgments, estimates and assumptions, the most significant of which were volume, revenue, income, perpetual growth rate and discount rate. All significant inputs used in the valuations are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nAs further discussed in Note 20. Contingencies , on January 29, 2025, the U.S. International Trade Commission ('ITC') issued its final determination, including the form of remedy, in the complaint filed by JUUL against Altria and certain of our affiliates, including NJOY, alleging patent infringement. Due to other factors that are uncertain at this time, we are not able to estimate the impact of the ITC's final determination; however, it could result in a material non-cash impairment of our e-vapor reporting unit in future periods.\n\n## Note 7.

      "answer": "Procter & Gamble's ESOP debt guarantees result in debt being recorded with an offset to the Reserve for ESOP debt retirement, which is presented within Shareholders' equity. Additionally, any advances to the ESOP by the company increase the Reserve for ESOP debt retirement, directly impacting shareholder equity. The $737 million in preferred shares outstanding incurs dividend payments that are charged to Retained earnings, reducing the company's retained earnings over time. As a result, the company's retained earnings are directly affected by the dividend obligations on preferred shares, while the ESOP debt guarantees and advances influence the composition of shareholder equity through the Reserve for ESOP debt retirement. This dual treatment means that both the dividend payments and ESOP debt obligations have a measurable effect on the company's equity structure and retained earnings.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The $737 million in preferred shares outstanding at June 30, 2024, and their convertibility into common stock directly affect shareholder equity and dividend obligations.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - ESOP debt guaranteed by the company is recorded as debt with an offset to the Reserve for ESOP debt retirement, which is presented within Shareholders' equity. Advances to the ESOP increase this reserve.",

Meanwhile, ESOP debt guarantees and company advances directly affect the equity structure through the Reserve for ESOP debt retirement. Together, these elements shape both retained earnings and shareholder equity."

      "question": "Given Colgate's 70% international sales exposure, how did the company's logistics cost pressures from rising eCommerce demand in 2021 specifically affect its gross margin performance, and what strategic initiatives were highlighted in the 10-K to mitigate this risk?",
      "answer": "Colgate's 70% international sales exposure intensified the impact of rising logistics costs driven by increased eCommerce demand in 2021. As stated in the Outlook section, Colgate incurred higher logistics costs due to volume and capacity constraints in the shipping and logistics industry, which were amplified by growing eCommerce fulfillment requirements. These cost pressures, combined with elevated raw and packaging material costs, were expected to persist into 2022 and could adversely affect future results. In response, Colgate highlighted the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative as a key strategic effort to offset these pressures through cost reduction and operational efficiency. Additionally, the company emphasized investments in digital and analytics capabilities to better navigate the evolving retail landscape and manage cost volatility.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Colgate's 70% of net sales originate outside the U.S., and the company faced significantly higher logistics costs in 2021 due to volume and capacity constraints and increased eCommerce demand.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The 2022 Global Productivity Initiative is explicitly mentioned as a key strategy to mitigate cost pressures and drive efficiency.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The combination of high international exposure (70% sales) and rising logistics costs due to eCommerce trends directly impacted Colgate's cost structure and gross margin performance. The 10-K links these pressures to the company's mitigation strategy through the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative."

          "chunk_text": "In 2019, we received a favorable judgment regarding certain value-added tax previously paid in Brazil. As a result of this favorable judgment, during the fourth quarter of 2019, we filed an application with the Brazilian government to recover value-added tax previously paid and recorded a benefit. In May 2021, the Brazilian Supreme Court issued a clarifying ruling allowing a higher deduction of state value-added tax when determining the taxable base. In light of this ruling, we recorded an additional benefit of $26 pretax ($20 aftertax) in the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nThe Global Growth and Efficiency Program, a multi-year restructuring program, concluded on December 31, 2019. Initiatives under the Global Growth and Efficiency Program fit within the program's three focus areas of expanding commercial hubs, extending shared business services and streamlining global functions and optimizing the global supply chain and facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we adjusted the accrual balances related to certain projects approved prior to the conclusion of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program to reflect our revised estimate of remaining liabilities, which resulted in a reduction of $16 ($13 aftertax) to restructuring accruals. For more information regarding the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, see Note 4, Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes $71 of income tax benefits, of which $45 relates to previously recorded foreign withholding taxes and $26 relates to a previously recorded valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset. As described more fully in 'Results of Operations-Income Taxes,' below, both items were previously recorded in connection with the charge recorded in 2017 and revised in 2018 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 'TCJA').\n\nOn January 31, 2020, we acquired Hello Products LLC ('hello'), an oral care business, for cash consideration of $351. The acquisition was financed with a combination of debt and cash. This acquisition is part of our strategy to focus on high growth segments within our Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition businesses. See Note 3, Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Outlook\n\nLooking forward, we expect global macroeconomic, political and market conditions to remain challenging, especially due to COVID-19. During the year ended December 31, 2021, all of our divisions experienced significantly higher raw and packaging material costs. We also incurred increased logistics costs due to volume and capacity constraints in the shipping and logistics industry and higher eCommerce demand. We expect this difficult cost environment to continue in 2022.\n\nWhile the global marketplace in which we operate has always been highly competitive, we continue to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from strong local competitors, from other large multinational companies, some of which have greater resources than we do, and from new entrants into the market in many of our categories. Such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges, as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion.\n\nWe have been negatively affected by changes in the policies and practices of our trade customers in key markets, such as inventory de-stocking, fulfillment requirements, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products and certain environmental, sustainability, supply chain and packaging standards or initiatives. In addition, the retail landscape in many of our markets continues to evolve as a result of the rapid growth of eCommerce, changing consumer preferences (as consumers increasingly shop online and via mobile and social applications) and the increased presence of alternative retail channels, such as subscription services and direct-to-consumer businesses. These trends have been magnified due to COVID-19 in many of our geographies and we plan to continue to invest behind our digital and analytics capabilities and higher growth businesses, such as eCommerce. This rapid growth in eCommerce and the emergence of alternative retail channels have created and may continue to create pricing pressures and/or adversely affect our relationships with our key retailers.\n\nIn addition, given that approximately 70% of our Net sales originate in markets outside the U.S., we have experienced and will likely continue to experience volatile foreign currency fluctuations. As discussed above, we have also experienced higher raw and packaging material and logistics costs. While we have taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions, such as the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative and our funding the growth and revenue growth management initiatives, including additional pricing, in the current environment, it may become increasingly difficult to implement certain of these mitigation strategies. Should these conditions persist, they could adversely affect our future results.",

Segment Information\n\nThe Company operates in two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition.\n\nThe operations of the Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment are managed geographically in five reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Africa/Eurasia.\n\nThe Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including Operating profit. The Company uses Operating profit as a measure of operating segment performance because it excludes the impact of Corporate-driven decisions related to interest expense and income taxes.\n\nThe accounting policies of the operating segments are generally the same as those described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Intercompany sales have been eliminated. Corporate operations include costs related to stock options and restricted stock units, research and development costs, Corporate overhead costs, restructuring and related implementation charges and gains and losses on sales of non-core product lines and assets. The Company reports these items within Corporate operations as they relate to Corporate-based responsibilities and decisions and are not included in the internal measures of segment operating performance used by the Company to measure the underlying performance of the operating segments.\n\nApproximately 70% of the Company's Net sales are generated from markets outside the U.S., with approximately 45% of the Company's Net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of Latin America, Asia (excluding Japan), Africa/Eurasia and Central Europe). Oral, Personal and Home Care sales to Walmart, Inc. and its affiliates represent approximately 12%, 12% and 11% of the Company's Net sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

      "answer": "The growth of illegal flavored disposable e-vapor products negatively impacts Altria's business in three key ways: (1) it accelerates domestic cigarette industry volume decline as adult smokers switch to these products, (2) it distorts the e-vapor market by comprising a significant portion of the category and increasing cross-category movement, and (3) it creates an uneven competitive landscape that requires Altria to increase engagement with the FDA and incur additional legal costs to protect its lawful e-vapor business.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, we learn that Altria monitors the growth of illegal flavored disposable e-vapor products and their negative impact on domestic cigarette and e-vapor industry volumes.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, we find specific mechanisms: the products accelerate cigarette volume decline, distort the e-vapor market by comprising a significant portion of the category, and increase Altria's costs through engagement with the FDA and legal actions.",
        "Step 3: Synthesizing both sources reveals that these illegal products create multiple business challenges for Altria across both its cigarette and e-vapor product lines, affecting volume trends, market dynamics, and operating expenses."

      "question": "How do adverse weather patterns impact Altria's (MO) tobacco supply chain and profitability, considering both agricultural production risks and the company's strategies to mitigate these challenges?",
      "answer": "Adverse weather patterns impact Altria's (MO) tobacco supply chain by increasing the cost or reducing the supply and quality of tobacco and other raw materials used in product manufacturing. This is specifically tied to shifts in crops driven by weather changes, which can lead to supply imbalances and increased costs. For example, variations in weather patterns, including those caused by climate change, influence the price, quality, and availability of tobacco leaf, especially for varieties only available in limited geographies. Additionally, reduced demand for tobacco leaf has caused growers to divert resources to other crops or cease farming, further reducing supply and increasing costs. These disruptions negatively impact Altria's ability to continue manufacturing and marketing existing products and affect adult tobacco consumer product acceptability, ultimately having a material adverse effect on the company's business and profitability. To mitigate these challenges, Altria has implemented various strategies to secure sufficient supplies of raw materials, ingredients, and component parts for production, including managing supply chain disruptions caused by macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical instability.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - 'Shifts in crops (such as those driven by macroeconomic conditions and adverse weather patterns)... may increase the cost or reduce the supply or quality of tobacco, other raw materials, ingredients or component parts used to manufacture our products.'",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - 'As with other agricultural commodities, tobacco price, quality and availability can be influenced by variations in weather patterns, including those caused by climate change... The unavailability or unacceptability of any one or more particular varieties of tobacco leaf... could negatively impact our ability to continue marketing existing products.'",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Adverse weather patterns directly affect the agricultural production of tobacco, reducing supply and increasing costs. This leads to profitability challenges for Altria, as the company depends on stable tobacco availability and pricing for its products. Altria has implemented strategies to mitigate these risks, but the material adverse effects are still acknowledged in the filings."
