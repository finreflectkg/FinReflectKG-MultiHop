      "answer": "Intel uses EUV in its Intel 4 process node to print small features using ultra-short wavelength light, which is critical for improving performance-per-watt and enabling future client processors like Meteor Lake. Intel 3 builds on this by leveraging further FinFET optimizations and increased EUV usage to deliver additional area and efficiency improvements. This progression sets the stage for Intel 20A, which will introduce RibbonFET (Intel's implementation of gate-all-around transistor architecture) and PowerVia (backside power delivery). Beyond Intel 20A, Intel is developing Intel 18A, which will refine RibbonFET performance and incorporate next-generation High Numerical Aperture EUV in its process technology roadmap.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, Intel 4 uses EUV to print small features and is applied to Meteor Lake processors, showing the immediate role of EUV in process node advancement.",

        "Step 3: Again from evidence_source_a, Intel 20A introduces RibbonFET and PowerVia, which are enabled by the prior advancements in EUV from Intel 4 and Intel 3.",
        "Step 4: Continuing with evidence_source_a, Intel 18A follows Intel 20A and is described as refining RibbonFET while incorporating next-generation High Numerical Aperture EUV, indicating a direct technological evolution tied to EUV capabilities."

          "chunk_text": "## Research and Development\n\nR&amp;D investment is critical to enable us to deliver on our accelerated process technology roadmap, introduce leading products, and develop new businesses and capabilities in the future. We seek to protect our R&amp;D efforts through our IP rights and may augment R&amp;D initiatives by acquiring or investing in companies, entering into R&amp;D agreements, and directly purchasing or licensing technology.\n\n## Areas Key to Product Leadership\n\nEvery year we make significant investments in R&amp;D and we have intensified our focus on areas key to product leadership. Our objective with each new generation of products is to improve user experiences and value through advances in performance, power, cost, connectivity, security, form factor, and other features. We also focus on reducing our design complexity, re-using IP, and increasing ecosystem collaboration to improve our efficiency.\n\nProcess and packaging. At our Intel Accelerated event in July 2021, we provided an update on our manufacturing process and packaging technology roadmaps. As part of the update, we also introduced a new naming structure for our manufacturing process nodes, which includes the name changes summarized in \"Key Terms\". In addition, we introduced future nodes and discussed future process and packaging technologies on our roadmap. Our updates included the following:\n\n- We introduced further optimizations to our Intel 7 process node, which is now in production for our 12th Gen Intel Core (Alder Lake) processors.\n- Intel 4 will make use of EUV to print incredibly small features using ultra-short wavelength light. Intel 4 will be used for our future Meteor Lake client processors.\n- Intel 3 will leverage further FinFET optimizations and increased EUV to deliver additional performance-per-watt and area improvements over Intel 4.\n- Intel 20A will follow Intel 3 and will introduce two breakthrough technologies: Ribbon FET and PowerVia. RibbonFET, Intel's implementation of a gate-all-around transistor, will be our first new transistor architecture since we pioneered FinFET in 2011. The technology is expected to deliver faster transistor switching speeds while achieving the same drive current as multiple fins in a smaller footprint. PowerVia will be our unique industry-first implementation of backside power delivery, optimizing signal transmission by eliminating the need for power routing on the front side of the wafer.\n- Beyond Intel 20A, we are developing our Intel 18A node, with expected refinements to RibbonFET to deliver additional transistor performance improvements. We are also working to define, build, and deploy next-generation High Numerical Aperture EUV in our process technology roadmap.\n- Our future Foveros Omni advanced packaging technology will usher in the next generation of our 3D stacking Foveros technology, enabling us to mix multiple top die tiles with multiple base tiles across mixed fab nodes and giving us greater flexibility for disaggregated chip designs. With our future Foveros Direct technology, we will move to direct copper-to-copper bonding for low-resistance interconnects and blur the boundary between where the wafer ends and the package begins.\n\nxPU architecture. The future is a diverse mix of scalar, vector, matrix, and spatial architectures deployed in CPU, GPU, accelerator, and FPGA sockets, enabled by a scalable software stack and integrated into systems by advanced packaging technology. We are building processors that span several major computing architectures, moving toward an era of heterogeneous computing:\n\n- CPU. We started shipping our 3rd Gen Xeon Scalable processors (Ice Lake) with the new Sunny Cove core, built-in AI acceleration, cryptographic acceleration, and advanced security capabilities. We also launched our 12th Gen Intel Core processors (Alder Lake), which will scale from thin and light laptops to enthusiast desktop and notebook platforms. They utilize the new breakthrough Performance-core (Golden Cove) and Efficient-core (Gracemont) microarchitectures and work with Intel Thread Director for scheduling optimization. \u00ae\n- GPU. We announced Alchemist, our first Intel Arc branded high-performance discrete GPU family of products focused on gaming and content creation, which began shipping to OEMs in Q1 2022. We also powered on Ponte Vecchio, our discrete GPU focused on high-performance computing applications, which delivers leading floating-point operations per second (FLOPS) and compute density to accelerate AI, highperformance computing, and advanced analytics workloads. Ponte Vecchio will be released in 2022 for HPC and AI markets.\n- Interconnect. Mount Evans, Intel's first ASIC IPU, is designed to address the complexity of diverse and dispersed data centers. An IPU is designed to enable cloud and communication service providers to reduce overhead and free up performance for CPUs.\n- Matrix Accelerator. Habana Gaudi accelerators are at the forefront of AI solutions for data centers. Amazon Web Services launched the EC2 DL1 instance featuring Habana Gaudi in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud for training deep learning models.",

          "chunk_text": "## Market and Business Overview\n\n## Market Trends and Strategy\n\nWith the rise of pervasive connectivity and autonomous transactions, vast networks of devices and systems are linked from the edge through infrastructure to the cloud. Our FPGA and structured ASIC technologies enhance Intel's ability to meet the needs of customers in the data center, across the network, and at the edge by extending platform capabilities, intercepting evolving requirements when standards are still changing, and enabling customers to validate next-generation technology proof points early in the market transition. The Intel FPGA portfolio enables this transformation with discrete FPGAs and software-defined, hardware-based, multi-function acceleration cards and IPUs that allow faster development times, high performance, and power efficiency with lower overall total cost of ownership.\n\nWe enable a broad range of solutions targeting applications across our embedded, communications, and cloud and enterprise market segments. The configurability and efficiency of FPGAs provide advantages to enable transformative applications such as 5G wireless, network function virtualization acceleration, and edge acceleration for video analytics and Industry 4.0. At the edge, where systems ingest large amounts of data, Intel FPGAs are ideal for pre-processing data to accelerate Intel processors. In the network, where data traffic is increasing and network functions are being virtualized to improve transport efficiency, Intel FPGAs are built to deliver high-bandwidth aggregation and processing. In the cloud, where workloads shift dynamically and algorithms change, Intel FPGAs are the ideal solution for adapting to new demands through reconfigurability and enabling the offload of infrastructure processing tasks from CPUs as part of an IPU platform.\n\n## Products and Competition\n\nWe deliver solutions in the PLD market, primarily FPGAs and structured ASICs, to accelerate applications that help secure, power, and connect billions of devices and the infrastructure of the smart, connected, data-centric world. We face competition from other programmable logic companies, as well as companies that make other types of semiconductor products, such as ASICs, application-specific standard products, GPUs, digital signal processors, and CPUs. Targeted growth areas for our programmable solutions include 5G, AI, intelligent edge, and cloud applications. The FPGA life cycle generally takes three or more years from the time that a design win is secured before a customer starts volume production and we receive the associated revenue.\n\nWe continue to leverage our heterogeneous architecture on advanced nodes to deliver innovative products at an accelerated pace, allowing the integration of analog, memory, custom computing, custom I/O, and Intel eASIC chiplets into a single package. Our Intel Agilex FPGA family, built on Intel 10nm SuperFin technology, is now shipping. The Agilex family delivers leading performance and power efficiency for diverse workloads.\n\nWe continue to invest in our Intel eASIC portfolio. Our Intel eASIC N5X, the next-generation Intel eASIC device, is now in production. Structured ASIC products serve as an intermediary technology between FPGAs and standard-cell ASICs that provides lower unit cost and lower power compared to FPGAs, and faster time-to-market and lower non-recurring engineering cost compared to standard-cell ASICs. Intel eASIC products have growth opportunities through adoption in 5G applications and scale across a wide range of markets.\n\nWe continue to execute to our developer-first strategy with oneAPI support for several Intel FPGA families and the Intel  FPGA Programmable Acceleration Card. The oneAPI programming model allows users to save significant development time and enhance productivity while using a single, unified language for CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs. \u00ae\n\nWe introduced several new platforms, solutions, and partnerships during the year. We announced Arrow Creek, an FPGA-based Acceleration Development Platform SmartNIC adapter that can flexibly accelerate several infrastructure workloads and enable high-performance 100G connectivity by combining Intel's Agilex FPGA and the Intel Ethernet 800 Series controller. We introduced RedHat support for Intel Open FPGA Stack, further enabling solution and board providers to build their own differentiated FPGA platforms for servers with Intel Xeon CPUs. We also announced with the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency a three-year partnership to advance the development of domestically manufactured structured ASIC platforms.\n\nIntel FPGAs play a critical role in Intel's announced IPU vision, enabling cloud and communications service providers to reduce overhead and free up performance for CPUs. Intel FPGA-based IPU platforms are currently deployed at multiple cloud service providers. We also announced Oak Springs Canyon, an IPU reference platform built with our Intel Xeon D processor and our Intel Agilex FPGA.\n\nMD&amp;A",

Our global, internal factory network has been foundational to our success, enabling product optimization, improved economics, and supply resilience. We intend to remain a leading developer of process technology and a major manufacturer of semiconductors and will continue to build the majority of our products in our factories.\n\nStrategic use of foundry capacity. We expect to expand our use of third-party foundry manufacturing capacity, which will provide us with increased flexibility and scale to optimize our product roadmaps for cost, performance, schedule, and supply. Our use of foundry capacity will include manufacturing for a range of modular tiles on advanced process technologies.\n\nFoundry services. We intend to build a world-class foundry business to meet the growing global demand for semiconductors. We plan to differentiate our foundry offerings from those of others through a combination of leading-edge packaging and process technology, committed capacity in the US and Europe available for customers globally, and a world-class IP portfolio that will include x86 cores, as well as other ecosystem IP.\n\nWe believe our IDM 2.0 strategy will enable us to deliver leading process technology and products to meet growing demand, while providing superior capacity and supply resilience and an advantageous cost structure.\n\nDelivering on our IDM 2.0 strategy and growth ambitions requires attracting, developing, and retaining top talent from across the world. Fostering a culture of empowerment, inclusion, and accountability is also core to our strategy. We are committed to creating an inclusive workplace where the world's best engineers and technologists can fulfill their dreams and create technology that improves the life of every person on the planet.\n\n## Growth Imperative\n\nWe are investing to position the company for accelerated long-term growth, focusing on both our core businesses and our growth businesses. In our client and server businesses, our strategy is to invest to strengthen the competitiveness of our product roadmap and to explore opportunities in both client and data center adjacencies. We believe we have significant opportunities to grow and gain share in graphics; mobility, including autonomous driving; networking and edge; and foundry services.\n\n## Focus on Innovation and Execution\n\nWe are focused on executing our product and process roadmap and accelerating our cadence of innovation.

          "chunk_text": "## Research and Development\n\nR&amp;D investment is critical to enable us to deliver on our accelerated process technology roadmap, introduce leading products, and develop new businesses and capabilities in the future. We seek to protect our R&amp;D efforts through our IP rights and may augment R&amp;D initiatives by acquiring or investing in companies, entering into R&amp;D agreements, and directly purchasing or licensing technology.\n\n## Areas Key to Product Leadership\n\nEvery year we make significant investments in R&amp;D and we have intensified our focus on areas key to product leadership. Our objective with each new generation of products is to improve user experiences and value through advances in performance, power, cost, connectivity, security, form factor, and other features. We also focus on reducing our design complexity, re-using IP, and increasing ecosystem collaboration to improve our efficiency.\n\nProcess and packaging. At our Intel Accelerated event in July 2021, we provided an update on our manufacturing process and packaging technology roadmaps. As part of the update, we also introduced a new naming structure for our manufacturing process nodes, which includes the name changes summarized in \"Key Terms\". In addition, we introduced future nodes and discussed future process and packaging technologies on our roadmap. Our updates included the following:\n\n- We introduced further optimizations to our Intel 7 process node, which is now in production for our 12th Gen Intel Core (Alder Lake) processors.\n- Intel 4 will make use of EUV to print incredibly small features using ultra-short wavelength light. Intel 4 will be used for our future Meteor Lake client processors.\n- Intel 3 will leverage further FinFET optimizations and increased EUV to deliver additional performance-per-watt and area improvements over Intel 4.\n- Intel 20A will follow Intel 3 and will introduce two breakthrough technologies: Ribbon FET and PowerVia. RibbonFET, Intel's implementation of a gate-all-around transistor, will be our first new transistor architecture since we pioneered FinFET in 2011. The technology is expected to deliver faster transistor switching speeds while achieving the same drive current as multiple fins in a smaller footprint. PowerVia will be our unique industry-first implementation of backside power delivery, optimizing signal transmission by eliminating the need for power routing on the front side of the wafer.\n- Beyond Intel 20A, we are developing our Intel 18A node, with expected refinements to RibbonFET to deliver additional transistor performance improvements. We are also working to define, build, and deploy next-generation High Numerical Aperture EUV in our process technology roadmap.\n- Our future Foveros Omni advanced packaging technology will usher in the next generation of our 3D stacking Foveros technology, enabling us to mix multiple top die tiles with multiple base tiles across mixed fab nodes and giving us greater flexibility for disaggregated chip designs. With our future Foveros Direct technology, we will move to direct copper-to-copper bonding for low-resistance interconnects and blur the boundary between where the wafer ends and the package begins.\n\nxPU architecture. The future is a diverse mix of scalar, vector, matrix, and spatial architectures deployed in CPU, GPU, accelerator, and FPGA sockets, enabled by a scalable software stack and integrated into systems by advanced packaging technology. We are building processors that span several major computing architectures, moving toward an era of heterogeneous computing:\n\n- CPU. We started shipping our 3rd Gen Xeon Scalable processors (Ice Lake) with the new Sunny Cove core, built-in AI acceleration, cryptographic acceleration, and advanced security capabilities. We also launched our 12th Gen Intel Core processors (Alder Lake), which will scale from thin and light laptops to enthusiast desktop and notebook platforms. They utilize the new breakthrough Performance-core (Golden Cove) and Efficient-core (Gracemont) microarchitectures and work with Intel Thread Director for scheduling optimization. \u00ae\n- GPU. We announced Alchemist, our first Intel Arc branded high-performance discrete GPU family of products focused on gaming and content creation, which began shipping to OEMs in Q1 2022. We also powered on Ponte Vecchio, our discrete GPU focused on high-performance computing applications, which delivers leading floating-point operations per second (FLOPS) and compute density to accelerate AI, highperformance computing, and advanced analytics workloads. Ponte Vecchio will be released in 2022 for HPC and AI markets.\n- Interconnect. Mount Evans, Intel's first ASIC IPU, is designed to address the complexity of diverse and dispersed data centers. An IPU is designed to enable cloud and communication service providers to reduce overhead and free up performance for CPUs.\n- Matrix Accelerator. Habana Gaudi accelerators are at the forefront of AI solutions for data centers. Amazon Web Services launched the EC2 DL1 instance featuring Habana Gaudi in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud for training deep learning models.",

Extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture dev ices on time to meet consumer demand.\n\n## RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\n## Product and Service Development, and Intellectual Property\n\nWe develop most of our products and serv ices internally through the following engineering groups.\n\n- Cloud and AI - focuses on making IT professionals, dev elopers, partners, independent software v endors, and their systems more productiv e and efficient through dev elopment of Azure AI platform and cloud infrastructure, serv er, database, CRM, ERP, software dev elopment tools and serv ices, AI cognitiv e serv ices, and other business process applications and serv ices for enterprises.\n- Strategic Missions and Technologies - focuses on incubating technical products and support solutions with transformativ e potential for the future of cloud computing and continued company growth, such as quantum computing and adv anced AI for science.\n- Experiences and Devices - focuses on deliv ering high v alue end-user experiences across our products, serv ices, and dev ices, including Microsoft 365, Windows, Microsoft Teams, and the Surface line of dev ices.\n- Microsoft AI - focuses on deliv ering online experiences targeted at consumers (including Bing, Copilot, Start/MSN, and other adv ertising-based serv ices) and dev eloping adv anced AI models.\n- Microsoft Security - focuses on deliv ering a comprehensiv e portfolio of serv ices that protect our customers' digital infrastructure through cloud platform and application security, data protection and gov ernance, identity and network access, and dev ice management.\n- Technology and Research - focuses on fundamental research, product and business incubations, and forward-looking AI innov ations that span infrastructure, serv ices, and applications. This engineering group includes Microsoft Research, one of the world's largest corporate research organizations, which focuses on fundamental research in AI, computer science, and a broad range of other disciplines.\n- LinkedIn - focuses on our serv ices that transform the way professionals grow their network and find jobs and the way businesses hire, market, sell, and learn.\n- Gaming - focuses on dev eloping hardware, content, and serv ices across a large range of platforms to help grow our user base through game experiences and social interaction.\n\nInternal dev elopment allows us to maintain competitiv e adv antages that come from product differentiation and closer technical control ov er our products and serv ices. It also giv es us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. We striv e to obtain information as early as possible about changing usage patterns and hardware adv ances that may affect software and hardware design. Before releasing new software platforms, and as we make significant modifications to existing platforms, we prov ide application v endors with a range of resources and guidelines for dev elopment, training, and testing. Generally, we also create product documentation internally.",

APJC is not only a key operating segment where Cisco generates revenue but also a region whose financial results are fully incorporated into Cisco\u2019s consolidated financial statements. This dual role means that performance metrics such as revenue and gross margin from the APJC segment directly feed into Cisco\u2019s overall financial reporting, even though certain expenses like R&D and restructuring charges are not allocated to the segment for internal management review. Therefore, APJC's financial performance influences both strategic decisions and consolidated earnings.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 1. Basis of Presentation\n\nThe fiscal year for Cisco Systems, Inc. (the 'Company,' 'Cisco,' 'we,' 'us,' or 'our') is the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the last Saturday in July. Fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 were each 52-week fiscal years. The Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts and those of our subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. We conduct business globally and are primarily managed on a geographic basis in the following three geographic segments: the Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific, Japan, and China (APJC).\n\nOur consolidated financial statements include our accounts and investments consolidated under the voting interest model. The noncontrolling interests attributed to these investments are not presented as a separate component in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets as these amounts are not material for any of the  fiscal  periods  presented.  The  share  of  earnings  attributable  to  the  noncontrolling  interests  are  not  presented  separately  in  the  Consolidated  Statements  of Operations as these amounts are not material for any of the fiscal periods presented.\n\nCertain reclassifications have been made to the amounts for prior years in order to conform to the current year's presentation. We have evaluated subsequent events through the date that the financial statements were issued.\n\n## 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n(a) Cash and Cash Equivalents   We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with various financial institutions.\n\n(b) Available-for-Sale Debt Investments   We classify our investments in fixed income securities as available-for-sale debt investments. Our available-for-sale debt investments  primarily  consist  of  U.S.  government,  U.S.  government  agency,  non-U.S.  government  and  agency,  corporate  debt,  U.S.  agency  mortgage-backed securities, commercial paper and certificates of deposit. These available-for-sale debt investments are primarily held in the custody of a major financial institution. A specific identification method is used to determine the cost basis of available-for-sale debt investments sold. These investments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on these investments are included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), net of tax . We classify our investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.\n\n(c) Equity Instruments Our equity investments are accounted for as follows:\n\n- Marketable equity securities have readily determinable fair value (RDFV) that are measured and recorded at fair value through income.\n- Non-marketable equity securities do not have RDFV and are measured using a measurement alternative recorded at cost less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes. For certain of these securities, we have elected to apply the net asset value (NAV ) practical expedient. The NAV is the estimated fair value of these investments.\n- Equity method investments are securities we do not control, but are able to ex ert significant influence over the investee. These investments are measured at cost less any impairment, plus or minus our share of equity method investee income or loss.\n\n(d) Impairments of Investments   For our available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss ex ists. In this assessment, among other factors, we consider the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security. If factors indicate a credit loss ex ists, an allowance for credit loss is recorded to other income (loss), net, limited by  the  amount  that  the  fair  value  is  less  than  the  amortized  cost  basis.

      "answer": "The balance of channel partner financing subject to guarantees decreased from $1.7 billion in fiscal 2023 to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2024, representing a year-over-year decrease of $0.5 billion. Cisco states in its MD&A that it believes its cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash generated from operations will satisfy its liquidity requirements, including working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, and commitments such as financing guarantees. This indicates that despite the decrease in guaranteed financing balances, Cisco remains confident in its ability to support such obligations through existing resources.",

Purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations.\n\nLong-Term Debt The  amount  of  long-term  debt  in  the  preceding  table  represents  the  principal  amount  of  the  respective  debt  instruments.  See  Note  12  to  the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nTransition Tax Payable Transition tax payable represents future cash tax payments associated with the one-time U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings for foreign subsidiaries as a result of the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act ('the Tax  Act').\n\nOther Long-Term Liabilities Other long-term liabilities primarily include noncurrent income tax es payable, accrued liabilities for deferred compensation, deferred tax liabilities, and certain other long-term liabilities. Due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments, our noncurrent income tax es payable of approximately $1.7 billion and deferred tax liabilities of $76 million were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table. Noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Other Commitments\n\nIn connection with our acquisitions, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our privately held investments. The funding commitments were $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion as of July 27, 2024 and July 29, 2023, respectively.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we have privately held investments and provide financing to certain customers. Certain of these investments are considered to be variable interest entities. We evaluate on an ongoing basis our privately held investments and customer financings, and we have determined that as of July 27, 2024 there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities.\n\nOn an ongoing basis, we reassess our privately held investments and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance. As a result of this ongoing assessment, we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities. Because we may not control these entities, we may not have the ability to influence these events.\n\nWe provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners. See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under 'Financing Receivables and Guarantees.'\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements\n\nBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically, including the following: working capital needs (including inventory and other supply related payments), capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, pending acquisitions, future customer financings, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. There are no other transactions, arrangements, or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of, as well as our requirements for, capital resources.",

Among other considerations, the applicability and impact of these tax provisions, and of other U.S. or international tax law changes could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and cash flows in future years.\n\nOur income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to discrete items including, but not limited to, the effects of tax credits, net tax benefits from trading structure changes, tax benefits from  stock-based  compensation  and  settlements  of  tax  examinations,  and  to  net  tax  on  earnings  from  foreign  operations. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations. Our future effective tax rates are likely to be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, the geographic mix of earnings, our repatriation policy or the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, by changes in or our interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, or by unexpected negative changes in business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits.\n\nIn addition, in the United States and other countries where we conduct business and in jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax, including those covered by governing bodies that enact tax laws applicable to us, such as the European Commission of the European Union, we are subject to potential changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including  changes  to  tax  laws  applicable  to  corporate  multinationals  such  as Adobe. These  countries,  governmental  bodies  and intergovernmental economic organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, have or could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined in their jurisdictions that are contrary to the way in which we have interpreted and historically applied the rules and regulations described above in such jurisdictions. In the current global tax policy environment, any changes in laws, regulations and interpretations related to these assertions could adversely affect our effective tax rates, cause us to respond by making changes to our business structure, or result in other costs to us which could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\n\nMoreover,  we  are  subject  to  the  examination  of  our  income  tax  returns  by  the  U.S.  Internal  Revenue  Service  and  other domestic and foreign tax authorities. These tax examinations are expected to focus on our research and development tax credits, intercompany  transfer  pricing  practices  and  other  matters.  We  regularly  assess  the  likelihood  of  outcomes  resulting  from  these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from these examinations. We cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\n\n## Contracting with government entities exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government procurement process.\n\nWe  provide  products  and  services,  directly  and  indirectly,  to  a  variety  of  government  entities,  both  domestically  and internationally.  Risks  associated  with  licensing  and  selling  products  and  services  to  government  entities  include  more  extended sales  and  collection  cycles,  varying  governmental  budgeting  processes  and  adherence  to  complex  procurement  regulations  and other government-specific contractual requirements. We have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to audits and investigations  relating  to  our  government  contracts  and  any  violations  could  result  in  various  civil  and  criminal  penalties  and administrative  sanctions,  including  termination  of  contracts,  payment  of  fines,  and  suspension  or  debarment  from  future government business, as well as harm to our reputation and financial results.\n\n## Risks Related to Financial Performance\n\n## Subscription offerings could create risks related to the timing of revenue recognition.\n\nWe generally recognize revenue from subscription offerings ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which typically  range  from  1  to  36  months. As  a  result,  most  of  the  subscription  revenue  we  report  in  each  quarter  is  the  result  of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Any reduction in new or renewed subscriptions in a quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results until a later quarter. Declines in new or renewed subscriptions may decrease our revenue in future quarters. Lower sales, reduced demand for our products and services, and increases in our attrition rate may not be fully reflected  in  our  results  of  operations  until  future  periods.  Our  subscription  model  could  also  make  it  difficult  for  us  to  rapidly increase  our  revenue  from  subscription-based  or  hosted  services  through  additional  sales  in  any  period,  as  revenue  from  new customers will be recognized over the applicable subscription term.\n\nAdditionally,  in  connection  with  our  sales  efforts  to  enterprise  customers,  a  number  of  factors  could  affect  our  revenue, including longer-than-expected sales and implementation cycles, potential deferral of revenue and alternative licensing arrangements. If any of our assumptions about revenue from our subscription-based offerings prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated.",

The estimated fair value of these obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost buildup approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin.\n\nUnanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\n\n## Accounting for Income Taxes\n\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the  expected  future  tax  consequences  of  temporary  differences  between  the  financial  reporting  and  tax  bases  of  assets  and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\nOur assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. In addition, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service  and  other  domestic  and  foreign  tax  authorities.  These  tax  examinations  are  expected  to  focus  on  our  research  and development tax credits, intercompany transfer pricing practices and other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from these examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, we cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have a significant impact on the amounts provided for income taxes in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nSee Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements that are of significance, or potential significance to us.\n\n## ACQUISITIONS\n\nIn  the  fourth  quarter  of  fiscal  2021,  we  completed  the  acquisition  of  Frame.io,  a  privately  held  company  that  provides  a cloud-based  video  collaboration  platform,  for  approximately  $1.18  billion  and  we  began  integrating  Frame.io  into  our  Digital Media reportable segment. In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we completed the acquisition of Workfront, a privately held company that provides a workflow platform, for approximately $1.52 billion in cash consideration and we began integrating Workfront into our Digital Experience reportable segment.\n\nSee Note 3 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these acquisitions.",

Adobe.com is the central destination where we engage individual and small business customers to sign up for and renew Creative Cloud subscriptions. Our customers have the flexibility to subscribe to over twenty of our Creative Cloud products through a single subscription or, for many of our applications, through various collections of our individual subscriptions to point products. To better serve our current users and potential users, we offer free and premium levels for certain applications, such as Creative Cloud Express, and targeted packages and suites, such as our Photography Plan and Substance 3D Collection. We use our data-driven operating model to optimize conversion of our users of free apps and trials to paid subscribers. Our collaboration tools and services help us to further expand our universe of business customers beyond creative professionals to other stakeholders who use our products for review and approval purposes, copywriting or  leveraging  templates  for  social  media  marketing.  We  utilize  channel  partners  to  target  mid-size  creative  customers  with  our Creative Cloud for teams offering. Our direct sales force is focused on building relationships with our largest customers and driving adoption  of  our  Creative  Cloud  for  enterprise  offering.  Overall,  our  strategy  with  Creative  Cloud  is  designed  to  enable  us  to increase  our  revenue  with  existing  users,  attract  new  customers  and  grow  a  recurring  and  predictable  revenue  stream  that  is recognized ratably.\n\nIn  our  Adobe  Document  Cloud  business,  we  expect  to  drive  sustained  long-term  revenue  growth  through  a  continued expansion of our customer base by continuing to deliver the best PDF experience on and across every platform, improve Acrobat web's functionality and single-click ease of use, expand the number of task-based actions in Acrobat, integrate Adobe Sign into Acrobat across all surfaces, drive innovation with Adobe Sensei (machine-learning/AI) to make both new and legacy documents more intelligent and responsive, unlock business workflows through PDF and Adobe Sign APIs, and leverage diversified go-tomarket motions to reach all segments. With over 50 million searches for PDF-related actions per month, we intend to harness that demand and attract new users to our Document Cloud services through Acrobat web, which allows anyone to quickly access tools to create, edit, convert, sign and compress PDFs through their web browser. As with our Creative Cloud strategy, we utilize a datadriven operating model to market our Document Cloud solutions and optimize our subscription-based pricing for individuals as well as small and medium-sized businesses, large enterprises and government institutions around the world. We aim to increase our reach in our key markets through the utilization of our corporate and volume licensing programs. We also intend to increase our focus on marketing and licensing Acrobat in targeted vertical markets such as education, financial services, telecommunications and government, as well as on expanding into emerging markets. We will continue to engage in strategic partnerships to help drive the enterprise business, including our partnerships with Microsoft, Workday, ServiceNow and Notarize.\n\nAs our Document Cloud customers increasingly expect business processes to be seamless across devices and the web, we are expanding our Document Cloud capabilities to meet this need. Acrobat Reader is available on mobile devices, with many of its standard features available on the go, and features 'Liquid Mode' to automatically reformat PDFs for quick navigation and easier consumption on smaller screens. Acrobat is also available on the web, delivering quick results for common PDF actions with a single click. Adobe Scan powers mobile devices with scanning capabilities, transforming paper documents into full-featured PDFs. Adobe  Sign  also  provides  a  green  alternative  to  costly,  paper-based  solutions  and  offers  a  modern,  convenient  solution  for customers  to  digitally  manage  their  documents,  automate  processes  and  contract  workflows.  We  believe  that  by  growing  the awareness of electronic signatures in the broader contract delivery and signing market, utilizing Adobe Sensei to enhance customer experiences through machine learning and AI and continuing to add new capabilities to our Acrobat, Adobe Scan and Adobe Sign offerings, we can help our customers continue to migrate away from paper-based processes and adopt our solutions to modernize and digitize document experiences, growing our revenue with this business in the process.\n\n## Digital Experience\n\n## Opportunity\n\nDigital  transformation  is  a  macro  trend  that  affects  every  business,  government  and  educational  institution  today-every business  is  a  digital  business.  Consumers  today  buy  experiences,  not  just  products,  and  they  demand  personalized  digital experiences that are relevant, engaging, seamless and secure across an ever-expanding range of channels and devices. Business customers increasingly have the same expectations, which drives business-to-business ('B2B') companies to deliver business-toconsumer ('B2C') experiences with a 'business-to-everyone' ('B2E') strategy. Delivering the best, personalized experience to a consumer at a given moment requires the right combination of data, insights and content across multiple channels in real time and at scale. In turn, executives, including those at the world's leading brands, are increasingly seeking solutions that enable real-time personalization at scale. Marketing and IT teams are looking for a return on investment to demonstrate the business impact of their transformation initiatives.\n\nAdobe  Experience  Cloud  is  powering  digital  businesses  by  providing  exceptional  experiences  to  their  customers  via  a comprehensive suite of solutions.

      "answer": "Oracle's strategic focus on Oracle Engineered Systems, which constitute a significant portion of its hardware revenues, makes the company more vulnerable to supply chain disruptions because these systems are complex and rely on timely delivery of components from third-party suppliers. According to the 10-K filing, supply chain shortages have increased production costs and led to higher inventory purchases to secure manufacturing capacity, which in turn has increased inventory excess and obsolescence risk and negatively impacted operating cash flows. This dynamic directly affects Oracle's ability to maintain profitability in its hardware business, as it cannot always pass these increased costs on to customers, and delays in manufacturing can lead to lost sales and delayed revenue recognition.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Oracle's hardware revenues primarily come from the sale of Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, and storage products.",

These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected. In many cases, the accounting treatment  of  a  particular  transaction  is  specifically  dictated  by  GAAP  and  does  not  require  management's  judgment  in  its application. There are also areas in which management's judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nOur sources of revenues include:\n\n- cloud and license revenues, which include the sale of: cloud services and license support; and cloud licenses and onpremise licenses, which typically represent perpetual software licenses purchased by customers for use in both cloud and on-premise IT environments;\n- hardware  revenues,  which  include  the  sale  of  hardware  products,  including  Oracle  Engineered  Systems,  servers,  and storage products, and industry-specific hardware; and hardware support revenues; and\n- services revenues, which are earned from providing cloud-, license- and hardware-related services including consulting and advanced customer services.\n\nLicense  support  revenues  are  typically  generated  through  the  sale  of  license  support  contracts  related  to  cloud  license  and  onpremise licenses purchased by our customers at their option. License support contracts provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period and include internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net cloud license and on-premise license fees. Substantially all of our customers elect to purchase and renew their license support contracts annually.\n\nCloud  services  revenues  include  revenues  from  Oracle  Cloud  Services  offerings,  which  deliver  applications  and  infrastructure technologies via cloud-based deployment models that we develop functionality for, provide unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploy, host, manage, upgrade and support and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period.\n\nCloud license and on-premise license revenues primarily represent amounts earned from granting customers perpetual licenses to use our database, middleware, application and industry-specific software products, which our customers use for cloud-based, onpremise and other IT environments. The vast majority of our cloud license and on-premise license arrangements include license support contracts, which are entered into at the customer's option.\n\nRevenues from the sale of hardware products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of our Oracle Engineered Systems, computer  servers,  storage,  and  industry-specific  hardware.  Our  hardware  support  offerings  generally  provide  customers  with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of the hardware products purchased and can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees.\n\nOur services are offered to customers as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other products and services. Our consulting services are designed to help our customers to, among others, deploy, architect, integrate, upgrade and secure their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies. Our advanced customer services are designed to provide supplemental support services, performance services and higher availability for Oracle products and services.",

Increased  customer  demand  for  these  services,  without  corresponding  revenues,  could increase  costs  and  adversely  affect  our  operating  results.  Any  failure  to  maintain  high-quality  technical  support,  or  a  market perception  that  we  do  not  maintain  high-quality  technical  support,  could  adversely  affect  our  reputation,  our  ability  to  sell  and renew our applications and infrastructure offerings to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results, and financial position.\n\nOur cloud offerings and hardware offerings are complex, and if we cannot successfully manage this complexity, including the sourcing  of  technologies  and  components,  the  results  of  these  businesses  will  suffer. We  depend  on  suppliers  to  develop, manufacture and deliver on a timely basis the necessary technologies and components for our hardware products that we market and sell to our customers and that we use as a part of our cloud infrastructure to deliver our cloud offerings, and there are some technologies and components that can only be purchased from a single vendor due to price, quality, technology, availability or other business constraints. Our supply chain operations have been, and likely will continue to be, negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and could also be disrupted by industry consolidation and component constraints or shortages, natural disasters, political unrest,  other  public  health  crises,  changes  to  trade  policies,  port  stoppages  or  other  transportation  disruptions  or  slowdowns,  or other factors affecting the countries or regions where these single source component vendors are located or where the products are being shipped. If one or more of the risks described above occurs, our cloud and license business and hardware business and related operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nWe are susceptible to third-party manufacturing and logistics delays, which could result in the loss of sales and customers. We outsource a majority of our manufacturing, assembly, delivery and technology of, and certain component designs for, our hardware products  to  a  variety  of  companies,  many  of  which  are  located  outside  the  U.S.  From  time  to  time,  these  partners  experience production problems, delays or cannot meet our demand for products. The conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic created, and likely will continue to create, delays in our supply chain. Third-party manufacturing and logistics delays attributable to the effects of COVID-19 caused delays in the manufacturing and fulfilment of certain customer orders during fiscal 2022. Ongoing or future delays in manufacturing could cause the loss of additional sales, delayed revenue recognition or an increase in our hardware products expenses, all of which could adversely affect the margins of our cloud and license business and hardware business. These challenges could arise if we alter our manufacturing strategies, suppliers, or locations.\n\nOur hardware revenues and profitability have declined and could continue to decline. Our hardware business may adversely affect our total revenues and overall profitability and related growth rates. We may not achieve our estimated revenue, profit or other financial projections with respect to our hardware business in a timely manner or at all due to a number of factors, including:\n\n- our focus on certain of our more profitable Oracle Engineered Systems and certain other hardware products we consider strategic and the de-emphasis of certain of our lower profit margin commodity hardware products;\n- changes in strategies and frequency for the development and introduction of new versions or next generations of our hardware products;\n- decreased customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products approach the end of their useful lives; and\n- general supply chain material shortages worldwide, which were further exacerbated globally as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSupply chain shortages have in some instances resulted in increases to the costs of production of our hardware products that we may not be able to pass on to our customers. In addition, we have in some instances responded to such shortages by committing to higher inventory purchases and balances relative to our historical positions in order to secure manufacturing capacity, which has in some instances increased inventory excess and obsolescence risk and adversely impacted our operating cash flows.\n\nOur periodic workforce restructurings and reorganizations can be disruptive. We are currently restructuring our workforce and in the past we have restructured or made other adjustments to our workforce in response to management changes, product changes, performance issues, changes in strategies, acquisitions and other internal",

      "answer": "Oracle's strategy of offering flexible deployment models, including Oracle Cloud Services, leads to a distinct revenue recognition pattern where cloud services revenues are generally recognized ratably over the contractual period, while on-premise and cloud license revenues are recognized up front at the point of delivery. This difference results in more predictable and stable revenue streams from Oracle Cloud Services compared to the point-in-time recognition of license revenues, which can be significantly affected by the timing of large license transactions.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, Oracle delivers its products through cloud-based, Cloud@Customer, on-premise, and hybrid models, with Oracle Cloud Services (SaaS and OCI) being a comprehensive integrated stack delivered via cloud deployment.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, Oracle Cloud Services arrangements are generally billed in advance and recognized ratably over the contractual period, whereas cloud and on-premise license revenues are recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The flexible deployment options (including Oracle Cloud Services) influence Oracle\u2019s revenue structure by creating a mix of ratable (cloud services) and point-in-time (licenses) revenue recognition, which affects the predictability and volatility of revenue streams."

ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nOracle Corporation provides products and services that substantially address all aspects of enterprise information technology (IT) environments, including applications and infrastructure technologies. We deliver our products and services to customers worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models, including cloud-based, Cloud@Customer (an instance of Oracle Cloud in the customer's own data center), on-premise and hybrid models. Oracle Cloud Software-as-a-Service and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (SaaS and OCI, respectively, and collectively, Oracle Cloud Services) offerings provide a comprehensive and integrated  stack  of  applications  and  infrastructure  services  delivered  via  cloud-based  deployment  models  that  Oracle  develops, deploys, hosts, upgrades, supports and manages for the customer. Customers may also elect to purchase Oracle software licenses and  hardware  products  and  related  services  to  manage  their  own  cloud-based  or  on-premise  IT  environments.  Customers  that purchase  our  software  licenses  may  elect  to  purchase  license  support  contracts,  which  provide  our  customers  with  rights  to unspecified license upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period as well as technical support assistance. Customers that purchase our hardware products may elect to purchase hardware support contracts, which provide customers with software updates and can include product repairs, maintenance services, and technical support services. We also offer customers a broad set of services offerings that are designed to improve customer utilization of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies.\n\nOracle Corporation conducts business globally and was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977.\n\n## Basis of Financial Statements\n\nThe consolidated  financial  statements  included  our  accounts  and  the  accounts  of  our  wholly-  and  majority-owned  subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interest positions of certain of our consolidated entities are reported as a separate component of consolidated equity from the equity attributable to Oracle's stockholders for all periods presented. The noncontrolling interests in our net income were not significant to our consolidated results for the periods presented and therefore have not been presented separately and instead are included as  a  component  of  non-operating  expenses  or  income,  net  in  our  consolidated  statements  of  operations.  Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\nThe comparability of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended May 31, 2022 was impacted by $4.7 billion of certain litigation related charges that are more fully described in Note 16 below. The comparability of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2021 was impacted by a $2.3 billion net income tax benefit related to the partial realignment of our legal entity structure that resulted in the intra-group transfer of certain intellectual property rights. Refer to Note 13 below for additional information regarding our income taxes.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes; and ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers , neither of which had a material impact to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2022.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth  in  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board's  (FASB)  Accounting  Standards  Codification  (ASC),  and  we  consider  the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the SEC. These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon",

Oracle  Cloud  Services arrangements are generally billed in advance of the cloud services being performed; generally have durations of one to three years; are generally renewed at the customer's option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the  contractual  period  of  the  cloud  contract  or,  in  the  case  of  usage  model  contracts,  as  the  cloud  services  are consumed over time.\n\n- Cloud  license  and  on-premise  license  revenues,  which  include  revenues  from  the  licensing  of  our  software  products including  Oracle  Applications,  Oracle  Database,  Oracle  Middleware  and  Java,  among  others,  which  our  customers deploy within cloud-based, on-premise and other IT environments. Our cloud license and on-premise license transactions are generally perpetual in nature and are generally recognized as revenues up front at the point in time when the software is  made available to the customer to download and use. Revenues from usage-based royalty arrangements for distinct cloud licenses and on-premise licenses are recognized at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs. The timing of a few large license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly license revenues due to the point-in-time nature of revenue recognition for license transactions, which is different than the typical revenue recognition pattern for our cloud services and license support revenues in which revenues are generally recognized ratably over the contractual terms. Cloud license and on-premise license customers have the option to purchase and renew license support contracts, as further described above.\n\nProviding  choice  and  flexibility  to  our  customers  as  to  when  and  how  they  deploy  Oracle  applications  and  infrastructure technologies  are  important  elements  of  our  corporate  strategy.  In  recent  periods,  customer  demand  for  our  applications  and infrastructure technologies delivered through our Oracle Cloud Services has increased. To address customer demand and enable customer choice, we have introduced certain programs for customers to pivot their applications and infrastructure licenses and the related license support to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for their existing workloads. The proportion of our cloud services and license support revenues relative to our cloud license and on-premise license revenues, hardware revenues and services revenues has increased and we expect this trend to continue. Cloud services and license support revenues represented 71% of our total revenues during each of fiscal 2022 and 2021 and 70% of our total revenues during fiscal 2020.\n\nOur  cloud  and  license  business'  revenue  growth  is  affected  by  many  factors,  including  the  strength  of  general  economic  and business  conditions;  governmental  budgetary  constraints;  the  strategy  for  and  competitive  position  of  our  offerings;  customer satisfaction with our offerings; the continued renewal of our cloud services and license support customer contracts by the customer contract  base;  substantially  all  customers  continuing  to  purchase  license  support  contracts  in  connection  with  their  license purchases; the pricing of license support contracts sold in connection with the sales of licenses; the pricing, amounts and volumes of licenses and cloud services sold; our ability to manage Oracle Cloud capacity requirements to meet existing and prospective customer demand; and foreign currency rate fluctuations.\n\nOn a constant currency basis, we expect that our total cloud and license revenues generally will continue to increase due to:\n\n- expected growth in our cloud services and license support offerings; and\n- continued demand for our cloud license and on-premise license offerings.\n\nWe believe these factors should contribute to future growth in our cloud and license business' total revenues, which should enable us  to  continue  to  make  investments  in  research  and  development  and  our  cloud  operations  to  develop,  improve,  increase  the capacity of and expand the geographic footprint of our cloud and license products and services.\n\nOur cloud and license business' margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our cloud and license business' revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this business are generally fixed in the short term. The historical upward trend of our cloud and license business' revenues over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year is primarily due to the addition of new cloud services and license support contracts to the",

      "answer": "Oracle's strategic focus on Oracle Engineered Systems, which are part of its hardware business, contributes to its infrastructure technologies revenue by offering integrated, high-performance solutions such as the Oracle Exadata Database Machine. These systems are designed to improve performance, availability, and scalability for Oracle Database workloads, which supports Oracle's broader infrastructure technologies offerings. Infrastructure cloud services and license support revenues represented 58% of Oracle's total cloud services and license support revenues in fiscal 2022, indicating the importance of these technologies to Oracle's financial performance. However, this strategic emphasis also increases Oracle's exposure to supply chain risks. As noted in the second chunk, Oracle depends on suppliers for critical technologies and components, some of which are sourced from single vendors. The company experienced manufacturing and fulfillment delays during fiscal 2022 due to supply chain disruptions, particularly those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. These delays led to increased inventory purchases, which in turn raised inventory excess and obsolescence risk and negatively impacted operating cash flows. Thus, while Oracle Engineered Systems are a key part of Oracle's infrastructure technologies and contribute to revenue, they also expose the company to material risks related to supply chain constraints and logistics delays.",

Substantially  all  of  our customers  opt  to  purchase  license  support  contracts  when  they  purchase  Oracle  applications  and  infrastructure  licenses  to  run within the Oracle Cloud or other cloud-based and on-premise IT environments. We believe our license support offerings protect and enhance  our  customers'  investments  in  Oracle  applications  and  infrastructure  technologies  because  they  provide  proactive  and personalized support services including Oracle Lifetime Support and unspecified license enhancements and upgrades during the term of the support period. Substantially all license support customers renew their support contracts with us upon expiration in order to continue to benefit from technical support services and the periodic issuance of unspecified updates and enhancements, which current license support customers are entitled to receive. Our license support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase the license, are typically one year in duration and are generally billed to the customer annually in advance.\n\n## Oracle Infrastructure Technologies\n\nOracle  infrastructure  technologies  are  marketed,  sold  and  delivered  through  our  cloud  and  license  business  and  through  our hardware business. Our infrastructure technologies are designed to be flexible, cost-effective, standards-based, secure and highperformance in order to facilitate the development, running, integration, management and extension across an organization's cloudbased, on-premise and hybrid IT environments.\n\nOur  cloud  and  license  business'  infrastructure  technologies  include  the  Oracle  Database,  which  is  the  world's  most  popular enterprise  database;  Java,  which  is  the  computer  industry's  most  widely-used  software  development  language;  and  middleware including  development  tools,  among  others.  These  infrastructure  technologies  are  available  through  a  subscription  to  our  OCI offerings or through the purchase of a license and related license support, at the customer's option, to run within the Oracle Cloud, as a part of a customer's on-premise cloud services, and in other customer IT environments. Our OCI offerings also include cloudbased compute, storage and networking capabilities, among others, and new and innovative services such as Oracle Autonomous Database (described further below), MySQL HeatWave and emerging technologies such as IoT, digital assistant, and blockchain.\n\nOur  hardware  business'  infrastructure  technologies  consist  of  hardware  products  and  certain  unique  hardware-related  software offerings and include Oracle Engineered Systems, enterprise servers, storage solutions, industry-specific hardware, virtualization software, operating systems, management software, and related hardware services, including hardware support at the customer's option.  Our  customers  utilize  Oracle  hardware  products  and  related  offerings  in  their  cloud-based,  on-premise  or  hybrid environments to run their internal business operations and to deliver products and services to their customers.\n\nWe design our infrastructure technologies to work in our customers' on-premise IT environments that may include other Oracle or non-Oracle hardware or software components. Our flexible and open approach also provides Oracle customers with a choice as to how they can utilize and deploy Oracle infrastructure technologies: through the use of Oracle Cloud offerings; on-premise in our customers'  data  centers;  or  a  hybrid  combination  of  these  two  deployment  models,  such  as  in  the  Oracle  Cloud@Customer deployment model (described further below). We focus on the operation and integration of Oracle infrastructure technologies to make them easier to deploy, extend, interconnect, manage and maintain for our customers and to improve computing performance relative to our competitors' offerings. For example, the Oracle Exadata Database Machine integrates multiple Oracle technology components  to  work  together  to  deliver  improved  performance,  availability,  scalability,  security  and  operational  efficiency  of Oracle Database workloads relative to our competitors' products.\n\n## Oracle Infrastructure Technologies - Cloud and License Business Offerings\n\nOracle infrastructure technologies are marketed, sold and delivered through our cloud and license business. Our infrastructure cloud services  and  license  support  revenues  represented  58%,  59%  and  60%  of  our  total  cloud  services  and  license  support  revenues during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.",

Increased  customer  demand  for  these  services,  without  corresponding  revenues,  could increase  costs  and  adversely  affect  our  operating  results.  Any  failure  to  maintain  high-quality  technical  support,  or  a  market perception  that  we  do  not  maintain  high-quality  technical  support,  could  adversely  affect  our  reputation,  our  ability  to  sell  and renew our applications and infrastructure offerings to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results, and financial position.\n\nOur cloud offerings and hardware offerings are complex, and if we cannot successfully manage this complexity, including the sourcing  of  technologies  and  components,  the  results  of  these  businesses  will  suffer. We  depend  on  suppliers  to  develop, manufacture and deliver on a timely basis the necessary technologies and components for our hardware products that we market and sell to our customers and that we use as a part of our cloud infrastructure to deliver our cloud offerings, and there are some technologies and components that can only be purchased from a single vendor due to price, quality, technology, availability or other business constraints. Our supply chain operations have been, and likely will continue to be, negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and could also be disrupted by industry consolidation and component constraints or shortages, natural disasters, political unrest,  other  public  health  crises,  changes  to  trade  policies,  port  stoppages  or  other  transportation  disruptions  or  slowdowns,  or other factors affecting the countries or regions where these single source component vendors are located or where the products are being shipped. If one or more of the risks described above occurs, our cloud and license business and hardware business and related operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nWe are susceptible to third-party manufacturing and logistics delays, which could result in the loss of sales and customers. We outsource a majority of our manufacturing, assembly, delivery and technology of, and certain component designs for, our hardware products  to  a  variety  of  companies,  many  of  which  are  located  outside  the  U.S.  From  time  to  time,  these  partners  experience production problems, delays or cannot meet our demand for products. The conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic created, and likely will continue to create, delays in our supply chain. Third-party manufacturing and logistics delays attributable to the effects of COVID-19 caused delays in the manufacturing and fulfilment of certain customer orders during fiscal 2022. Ongoing or future delays in manufacturing could cause the loss of additional sales, delayed revenue recognition or an increase in our hardware products expenses, all of which could adversely affect the margins of our cloud and license business and hardware business. These challenges could arise if we alter our manufacturing strategies, suppliers, or locations.\n\nOur hardware revenues and profitability have declined and could continue to decline. Our hardware business may adversely affect our total revenues and overall profitability and related growth rates. We may not achieve our estimated revenue, profit or other financial projections with respect to our hardware business in a timely manner or at all due to a number of factors, including:\n\n- our focus on certain of our more profitable Oracle Engineered Systems and certain other hardware products we consider strategic and the de-emphasis of certain of our lower profit margin commodity hardware products;\n- changes in strategies and frequency for the development and introduction of new versions or next generations of our hardware products;\n- decreased customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products approach the end of their useful lives; and\n- general supply chain material shortages worldwide, which were further exacerbated globally as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSupply chain shortages have in some instances resulted in increases to the costs of production of our hardware products that we may not be able to pass on to our customers. In addition, we have in some instances responded to such shortages by committing to higher inventory purchases and balances relative to our historical positions in order to secure manufacturing capacity, which has in some instances increased inventory excess and obsolescence risk and adversely impacted our operating cash flows.\n\nOur periodic workforce restructurings and reorganizations can be disruptive. We are currently restructuring our workforce and in the past we have restructured or made other adjustments to our workforce in response to management changes, product changes, performance issues, changes in strategies, acquisitions and other internal",

However, in fiscal 2022, supply chain disruptions, particularly those exacerbated by the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, caused manufacturing delays and fulfillment issues for hardware products. These delays led to potential loss of sales, delayed revenue recognition, and increased hardware product expenses, directly impacting the profitability of Oracle's hardware business. Additionally, Oracle faced increased production costs due to global supply chain shortages, which could not always be passed on to customers, further compressing margins.

Using Oracle technologies, our customers build,  deploy,  run,  manage  and  support  their  internal  and  external  products,  services  and  business  operations  including,  for example, a global cloud applications developer that utilizes Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to power its software-as-a-service (SaaS)  offerings;  a  multi-national  financial  institution  that  runs  its  banking  applications  using  the  Oracle  Exadata  Database Machine;  and  a  global  consumer  products  company  that  leverages  Oracle  Fusion  Cloud  Enterprise  Resource  Planning  for  its accounting processes, consolidation and financial planning functions.\n\nOracle Cloud Services offerings, which include Oracle SaaS and OCI offerings, provide comprehensive and integrated applications and  infrastructure  services  delivered  via  cloud-based  deployment  models.  Oracle  Cloud  Services  integrate  the  IT  components, including software, hardware and services, on a customer's behalf in a cloud-based IT environment that Oracle deploys, manages, supports and upgrades for the customer and that a customer may access utilizing common web browsers via a broad spectrum of devices.\n\nOracle Cloud Services are designed to be rapidly deployable to enable customers shorter time to innovation; intuitive for casual and experienced users; easily maintainable to reduce upgrade, integration and testing work; connectable among differing deployment models to enable interchangeability and extendibility between IT environments; compatible to easily move workloads between the Oracle Cloud and other IT environments; cost-effective by requiring lower upfront customer investment; and secure, standardsbased and reliable.\n\nOracle  cloud  license  and  on-premise  license  deployment  offerings  include  Oracle  Applications,  Oracle  Database  and  Oracle Middleware software offerings, among others, which customers deploy using IT infrastructure from the Oracle Cloud or their own cloud-based or on-premise IT environments. Substantially all customers, at their option, purchase license support contracts when they purchase an Oracle license.\n\nOracle  hardware  products  include  Oracle  Engineered  Systems,  servers,  storage  and  industry-specific  products,  among  others. Customers generally opt to purchase hardware support contracts when they purchase Oracle hardware products.\n\nOracle also offers services to assist our customers and partners to maximize the performance of their Oracle purchases.\n\nProviding  choice  and  flexibility  to  Oracle  customers  as  to  when  and  how  they  deploy  Oracle  applications  and  infrastructure technologies is an important element of our corporate strategy. We believe that offering customers broad, comprehensive, flexible and interoperable deployment models for Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies is important to our growth strategy and  better  addresses  customer  needs  relative  to  our  competitors,  many  of  whom  provide  fewer  offerings,  more  restrictive deployment models and less flexibility for a customer's transition to cloud-based IT environments.\n\nOur investments in, and innovation with respect to, Oracle products and services that we offer through our three businesses (cloud and license, hardware and services businesses, described further below) are another important element of our corporate strategy. In fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, we invested $7.2 billion, $6.5 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively, in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of offerings and to develop new technologies and services. We have a deep understanding as to how applications and infrastructure technologies interact and function with one another including through the use of OCI to power our Oracle Fusion SaaS Applications, which we and our customers use to run internal business processes. We focus our development efforts on improving the performance, security, operation, integration and cost-effectiveness of our offerings",

These investments help us to further enhance our differentiation and competitiveness in the marketplace. Our disciplined acquisition strategy, which is an engine to fuel organic growth, is focused on scaling our business in high-growth areas; adding skills and capabilities in new areas; and deepening our industry and functional expertise. In fiscal 2022, we invested $3.4 billion across 38 strategic acquisitions, $1.1 billion in R&amp;D, and $1.1 billion in learning and professional development. At year-end, we had more than 8,300 patents and pending patent applications worldwide.\n\n## Our Strategy\n\nThe core of our growth strategy is delivering 360\u00b0 value to our clients, people, shareholders, partners and communities. Our strategy defines the areas in which we will drive growth, build differentiation via 360\u00b0 value and enable our business to create that value every day. We define 360\u00b0 value as delivering the financial business case and unique value a client may be seeking, and striving to partner with our clients to achieve greater progress on inclusion and diversity, reskill and upskill our clients' employees, help our clients achieve their sustainability goals, and create meaningful experiences, both with Accenture and for the customers and employees of our clients.\n\nWe bring industry specific solutions and services as well as cross industry expertise and leverage our scale and global footprint, innovation capabilities, and strong ecosystem partnerships together with our assets and platforms including MyWizard, MyNav and SynOps to deliver tangible value for our clients.\n\nWe help our clients use technology to drive enterprise-wide transformation, which includes:\n\n- building their digital coresuch as moving them to the cloud, leveraging data and artificial intelligence, and embedding security across the enterprise;\n- optimizing their operationssuch as helping our clients digitize faster, access digital talent and reduce costs as well as through digitizing engineering and manufacturing; and\n- accelerating their revenue growthsuch as through using technology and creativity to create personalized connections, experiences and targeted sales at scale, leveraging data and AI, transforming content supply chains and marketing and commerce models and helping create new digital services and business models.\n\nOur managed services have become increasingly strategic as companies seek to move faster and leverage our digital platforms and talent as well as reduce costs.\n\nWe believe our strategy to deliver 360\u00b0 value makes us an attractive destination for top talent, a trusted partner to our clients and ecosystem, and a respected member of our communities.\n\nWe believe that the companies that will lead in the next decade need to harness the five key forces of change we have identified-total enterprise reinvention, talent, sustainability, the metaverse continuum and the ongoing technology revolution. We are investing and co-creating with clients and partners to lead in helping our clients thrive across these forces, which we expect to have different time horizons. Today, the strong demand we continue to see across our geographic markets, services and industries is being primarily driven by the first two, as companies are in the early stages of harnessing these forces. We have summarized below each of the five key forces as we currently see them evolving.\n\n- Total enterprise reinvention, as we believe every part of every business must be transformed by technology, data and AI, with new ways of working and engaging with customers, employees and partners, and new business models, products and services. We are helping clients build their digital core, optimize operations and accelerate growth.\n- Talent, as companies must be able to access great talent, be talent creators not just consumers, and unlock the potential of their people-from the ways they organize and work, to their culture, to their employee value proposition.\n- Sustainability, as consumers, employees, business partners, regulators and investors are demanding companies move from commitment to action-we believe every business must be a sustainable business.",

At the end of the VEIP program year, Accenture Leadership participants who did not withdraw from the program will be granted restricted share units under the Amended 2010 SIP equal to 50% of the number of shares purchased during that year and held by the participant as of the grant date.\n\nA maximum of 90,000,000 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares may be issued under the 2010 ESPP.

These investments help us to further enhance our differentiation and competitiveness in the marketplace. Our disciplined acquisition strategy, which is an engine to fuel organic growth, is focused on scaling our business in high-growth areas; adding skills and capabilities in new areas; and deepening our industry and functional expertise. In fiscal 2022, we invested $3.4 billion across 38 strategic acquisitions, $1.1 billion in R&amp;D, and $1.1 billion in learning and professional development. At year-end, we had more than 8,300 patents and pending patent applications worldwide.\n\n## Our Strategy\n\nThe core of our growth strategy is delivering 360\u00b0 value to our clients, people, shareholders, partners and communities. Our strategy defines the areas in which we will drive growth, build differentiation via 360\u00b0 value and enable our business to create that value every day. We define 360\u00b0 value as delivering the financial business case and unique value a client may be seeking, and striving to partner with our clients to achieve greater progress on inclusion and diversity, reskill and upskill our clients' employees, help our clients achieve their sustainability goals, and create meaningful experiences, both with Accenture and for the customers and employees of our clients.\n\nWe bring industry specific solutions and services as well as cross industry expertise and leverage our scale and global footprint, innovation capabilities, and strong ecosystem partnerships together with our assets and platforms including MyWizard, MyNav and SynOps to deliver tangible value for our clients.\n\nWe help our clients use technology to drive enterprise-wide transformation, which includes:\n\n- building their digital coresuch as moving them to the cloud, leveraging data and artificial intelligence, and embedding security across the enterprise;\n- optimizing their operationssuch as helping our clients digitize faster, access digital talent and reduce costs as well as through digitizing engineering and manufacturing; and\n- accelerating their revenue growthsuch as through using technology and creativity to create personalized connections, experiences and targeted sales at scale, leveraging data and AI, transforming content supply chains and marketing and commerce models and helping create new digital services and business models.\n\nOur managed services have become increasingly strategic as companies seek to move faster and leverage our digital platforms and talent as well as reduce costs.\n\nWe believe our strategy to deliver 360\u00b0 value makes us an attractive destination for top talent, a trusted partner to our clients and ecosystem, and a respected member of our communities.\n\nWe believe that the companies that will lead in the next decade need to harness the five key forces of change we have identified-total enterprise reinvention, talent, sustainability, the metaverse continuum and the ongoing technology revolution. We are investing and co-creating with clients and partners to lead in helping our clients thrive across these forces, which we expect to have different time horizons. Today, the strong demand we continue to see across our geographic markets, services and industries is being primarily driven by the first two, as companies are in the early stages of harnessing these forces. We have summarized below each of the five key forces as we currently see them evolving.\n\n- Total enterprise reinvention, as we believe every part of every business must be transformed by technology, data and AI, with new ways of working and engaging with customers, employees and partners, and new business models, products and services. We are helping clients build their digital core, optimize operations and accelerate growth.\n- Talent, as companies must be able to access great talent, be talent creators not just consumers, and unlock the potential of their people-from the ways they organize and work, to their culture, to their employee value proposition.\n- Sustainability, as consumers, employees, business partners, regulators and investors are demanding companies move from commitment to action-we believe every business must be a sustainable business.",

These investments help us to further enhance our differentiation and competitiveness in the marketplace. Our disciplined acquisition strategy, which is an engine to fuel organic growth, is focused on scaling our business in high-growth areas; adding skills and capabilities in new areas; and deepening our industry and functional expertise. In fiscal 2022, we invested $3.4 billion across 38 strategic acquisitions, $1.1 billion in R&amp;D, and $1.1 billion in learning and professional development. At year-end, we had more than 8,300 patents and pending patent applications worldwide.\n\n## Our Strategy\n\nThe core of our growth strategy is delivering 360\u00b0 value to our clients, people, shareholders, partners and communities. Our strategy defines the areas in which we will drive growth, build differentiation via 360\u00b0 value and enable our business to create that value every day. We define 360\u00b0 value as delivering the financial business case and unique value a client may be seeking, and striving to partner with our clients to achieve greater progress on inclusion and diversity, reskill and upskill our clients' employees, help our clients achieve their sustainability goals, and create meaningful experiences, both with Accenture and for the customers and employees of our clients.\n\nWe bring industry specific solutions and services as well as cross industry expertise and leverage our scale and global footprint, innovation capabilities, and strong ecosystem partnerships together with our assets and platforms including MyWizard, MyNav and SynOps to deliver tangible value for our clients.\n\nWe help our clients use technology to drive enterprise-wide transformation, which includes:\n\n- building their digital coresuch as moving them to the cloud, leveraging data and artificial intelligence, and embedding security across the enterprise;\n- optimizing their operationssuch as helping our clients digitize faster, access digital talent and reduce costs as well as through digitizing engineering and manufacturing; and\n- accelerating their revenue growthsuch as through using technology and creativity to create personalized connections, experiences and targeted sales at scale, leveraging data and AI, transforming content supply chains and marketing and commerce models and helping create new digital services and business models.\n\nOur managed services have become increasingly strategic as companies seek to move faster and leverage our digital platforms and talent as well as reduce costs.\n\nWe believe our strategy to deliver 360\u00b0 value makes us an attractive destination for top talent, a trusted partner to our clients and ecosystem, and a respected member of our communities.\n\nWe believe that the companies that will lead in the next decade need to harness the five key forces of change we have identified-total enterprise reinvention, talent, sustainability, the metaverse continuum and the ongoing technology revolution. We are investing and co-creating with clients and partners to lead in helping our clients thrive across these forces, which we expect to have different time horizons. Today, the strong demand we continue to see across our geographic markets, services and industries is being primarily driven by the first two, as companies are in the early stages of harnessing these forces. We have summarized below each of the five key forces as we currently see them evolving.\n\n- Total enterprise reinvention, as we believe every part of every business must be transformed by technology, data and AI, with new ways of working and engaging with customers, employees and partners, and new business models, products and services. We are helping clients build their digital core, optimize operations and accelerate growth.\n- Talent, as companies must be able to access great talent, be talent creators not just consumers, and unlock the potential of their people-from the ways they organize and work, to their culture, to their employee value proposition.\n- Sustainability, as consumers, employees, business partners, regulators and investors are demanding companies move from commitment to action-we believe every business must be a sustainable business.",

      "question": "How does Microsoft's treatment of unearned revenue from volume licensing programs, including the timing of invoicing and revenue recognition, impact the presentation and auditability of its financial statements, given the complexity in determining standalone selling prices (SSP) and the auditor's focus on revenue recognition?",
      "answer": "Microsoft recognizes unearned revenue from volume licensing programs, which include Software Assurance (SA) and cloud services, by invoicing annually at the beginning of each contract period and recognizing revenue ratably over the coverage period. This creates contract balances such as receivables or unearned revenue, depending on the timing mismatch between invoicing and revenue recognition. Due to the complexity in determining standalone selling prices (SSP) for on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates, Microsoft must use judgment and estimates based on customer size and geographic region, which affects the allocation of discounts and the pattern of revenue recognition. This complexity was a critical audit matter for Microsoft\u2019s independent auditors, who focused on the application of revenue recognition principles, especially around transfer of control and variable consideration. Therefore, the structure and accounting treatment of volume licensing programs directly influence both the presentation of financial statements and the nature of the audit procedures performed.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Microsoft records unearned revenue for volume licensing programs (including SA and cloud services), which is invoiced annually and recognized ratably over the contract period.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - Microsoft uses judgment to determine standalone selling prices (SSP), especially when products are not sold separately, and considers factors like customer size and geography.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b - The auditor specifically called out revenue recognition as a critical audit matter, focusing on the transfer of control and the application of revenue recognition rules to customer agreements, including volume licensing programs.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The complexity in determining SSP and recognizing revenue over time for volume licensing programs directly affects the financial statement presentation and was a key focus area in the audit due to the subjective estimates and timing considerations involved."

        "Step 3: Synthesize - By comparing the amount repurchased by 2022 with the remaining authorization in 2024, we can assess the utilization of the share repurchase program over time."

      "answer": "Accenture's profitability is at risk if its cost-management strategies fail, particularly when aligned with workforce demands for delivering services. Additionally, its reliance on ecosystem partners for technology and software introduces further risk, as disruptions or failures in partner performance could increase costs and reduce profitability. These two factors are interdependent: if ecosystem partners fail to deliver on time or within budget, Accenture's ability to manage costs effectively is compromised, thereby amplifying the risk to profitability.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Accenture's profitability is dependent on successfully managing operating costs, including aligning workforce size and skills with service demand.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Accenture relies heavily on ecosystem partners for technology and software, and any disruption in their ability to deliver could impact Accenture\u2019s service delivery timelines, pricing, and ultimately profitability.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - If ecosystem partners underperform or face supply chain or demand fluctuations, Accenture may incur unexpected costs or delays, which directly undermines its cost-management strategies and heightens profitability risks."

      "answer": "As of September 25, 2024, Accenture plc had a total outstanding share repurchase authority of $6,694 million. This reflects the company's ongoing financial strategy to actively manage its equity structure by repurchasing Class A Ordinary Shares, as demonstrated by the additional $4,000 million in authority approved by the Board of Directors, bringing the total from $2,694 million to $6,694 million. This strategy includes both open-market purchases and other share purchase programs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - The company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.48 per share on Class A ordinary shares, indicating active shareholder return strategy.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - As of August 31, 2024, Accenture had $2,694 million in aggregate available authorization for share purchases, with $50.1 billion authorized since August 2001.",
        "Step 3: Extract additional info from source B - On September 25, 2024, the Board approved an additional $4,000 million in share repurchase authority, increasing the total outstanding authority to $6,694 million.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The increase in repurchase authority combined with dividend activity shows a coordinated financial strategy to return capital to shareholders through both dividends and share buybacks."

      "answer": "Adobe Firefly, introduced in September 2023, is integrated into Creative Cloud apps such as Photoshop and Express, providing generative AI capabilities that enhance user engagement and attract new customers, including novice creators and communicators. This integration supports Adobe's strategy to increase recurring revenue by offering new features that justify subscription renewals and attract cost-sensitive users through targeted packages like Adobe Express and Substance 3D Collection. Additionally, Firefly's generative AI features are part of Adobe's broader AI-driven tools (e.g., Adobe Sensei), which improve Document Cloud's functionality, such as making PDFs more intelligent and responsive. These innovations help Adobe expand its customer base and drive long-term revenue growth through increased product value and user retention.",

      "question": "How does Adobe's introduction of Generative Credits in Adobe Firefly, as part of its Creative Cloud offering, support its broader strategy to increase customer engagement and subscription revenue across both creative professionals and non-creative stakeholders?",
      "answer": "Adobe introduced Generative Credits as part of Adobe Firefly within its Creative Cloud offering, allowing users to generate AI-based content after reaching a usage limit. These credits enhance the value of existing subscriptions and encourage continued engagement by offering a paid upsell option. This aligns with Adobe\u2019s strategy to use product-led growth, infusing AI into creative apps like Photoshop and Illustrator to make workflows more efficient and accessible. By integrating Firefly\u2019s generative AI capabilities into widely used tools and offering tiered access (free and premium), Adobe expands its customer base beyond traditional creative professionals to include communicators, marketers, and other stakeholders involved in content creation and approval. This drives higher engagement, conversion, and retention, directly supporting Adobe\u2019s goal of increasing recurring subscription revenue and deepening customer relationships.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Adobe Firefly allows users to buy additional Generative Credits once a usage limit is reached, enhancing the commercial safety and transparency of AI-generated content through Content Credentials.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Adobe's strategy includes integrating AI into Creative Cloud apps (e.g., Photoshop, Illustrator, Express) and using Generative Credits to increase subscription value, expand the customer base, and improve engagement and retention.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Adobe's introduction of Generative Credits supports its broader strategy by creating a monetization mechanism for AI capabilities, encouraging continued use and paid upgrades, while attracting a broader set of users beyond traditional creatives, thereby increasing subscription revenue and customer stickiness."

      "question": "How does the integration of Substance 3D Collection into Adobe's Creative Cloud strategy enhance the value proposition for users in terms of 3D content creation and workflow efficiency?",
      "answer": "The integration of Substance 3D Collection into Adobe's Creative Cloud strategy enhances the value proposition for users by offering a comprehensive ecosystem for 3D content creation and improving workflow efficiency. Substance 3D Collection provides a suite of desktop applications\u2014such as Substance 3D Painter, Sampler, and Stager\u2014that allow users to build and assemble 3D scenes, texture assets, and generate infinite variations of 3D textures from a professional library. This suite supports natural, fluid sculpting through VR and desktop environments, enabling creators to work in a more intuitive and immersive manner. Adobe enhances this offering by embedding it within its broader Creative Cloud platform, which includes native integrations with apps like Photoshop and Frame.io. These integrations streamline workflows by enabling real-time collaboration, frame-accurate commenting, and seamless access to assets across connected surfaces. Furthermore, Adobe\u2019s strategy of infusing AI into creative apps\u2014such as Firefly models trained on licensed content\u2014ensures that users benefit from generative AI capabilities that are commercially safe and aligned with Adobe\u2019s AI Ethics principles. This combination of advanced 3D tools and intelligent, collaborative workflows increases the value of Adobe\u2019s subscriptions, encouraging higher engagement and retention.",

      "question": "How does AMD's positioning of Versal within its Adaptive SoCs portfolio reflect a strategic focus on differentiating its offerings in big data and AI applications compared to its traditional FPGA platforms?",
      "answer": "AMD positions its Versal product line as a strategic evolution within its Adaptive SoCs portfolio, combining Scalar Processing Engines, Adaptable Hardware Engines, and Intelligent Engines with leading-edge memory and interfacing technologies. This design delivers heterogeneous acceleration tailored for big data and AI applications, representing a clear strategic shift toward addressing emerging high-growth markets. In contrast to traditional FPGA platforms, which primarily emphasize reconfigurable hardware and integrated components for broad applications, Versal is explicitly optimized to accelerate specific workloads in the era of big data and AI. This differentiation is further supported by AMD's ecosystem of tools, software, libraries, IP, middleware, and frameworks tailored for industry-standard design flows, enabling accessibility for software developers, data scientists, and hardware developers alike.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - AMD offers two types of adaptable platforms: FPGAs and Adaptive SoCs, with the latter featuring domain-specific architectures that provide flexibility beyond CPUs, GPUs, ASSPs, and ASICs.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Versal is highlighted as the most recent addition to AMD's silicon portfolio, uniquely combining Scalar Processing Engines, Adaptable Hardware Engines, and Intelligent Engines to deliver heterogeneous acceleration for big data and AI applications.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - AMD's strategic focus on big data and AI is evident through the positioning of Versal within its Adaptive SoCs lineup, which differentiates itself from traditional FPGA platforms by emphasizing optimized acceleration for these emerging workloads."

      "answer": "NVIDIA's introduction of the Omniverse platform, as stated in both sections of the filing, contributes to the complexity and risk in managing product transitions and demand forecasting by adding another innovative use case that increases the difficulty in predicting demand. Specifically, the filing notes that demand estimates for new use cases like Omniverse can be incorrect and create volatility in revenue or supply levels. Furthermore, the increased frequency and complexity of newly introduced products, such as Omniverse, may result in unanticipated quality or production issues that could increase inventory provisions, warranty or other costs, or result in product delays. These challenges are compounded by the difficulty in estimating demand for new and emerging technologies, which can lead to overestimation or underestimation of customer demand, impacting gross margins and financial results.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - NVIDIA introduces the Omniverse platform as part of its new use cases, and notes that demand estimates for such new use cases can be incorrect, creating volatility in revenue or supply levels.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The filing highlights that the increasing frequency and complexity of newly introduced products, such as Omniverse, may result in unanticipated quality or production issues, increasing costs or causing delays.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The introduction of the Omniverse platform increases the complexity of NVIDIA's product transitions and demand forecasting due to the unpredictability of demand for new use cases and the potential for production issues, which together heighten financial and operational risks."

      "answer": "The net effect on NVIDIA's gross margin from inventory provisions in fiscal year 2024 was an unfavorable impact of 2.7%. Consumer internet companies represent a significant portion of NVIDIA's customer base in their Compute & Networking segment, which saw a 217% revenue growth in fiscal year 2024, contributing to the overall gross margin improvement to 72.7% despite the inventory provision impact.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_b, extract that provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $2.2 billion for fiscal year 2024, with a net effect on gross margin being an unfavorable impact of 2.7%.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, extract that NVIDIA's overall gross margin increased to 72.7% in fiscal year 2024 from 56.9% in fiscal year 2023, primarily due to strong Data Center revenue growth of 217%.",
        "Step 3: From evidence_source_a, extract that NVIDIA's end customers include consumer internet companies, which are a key part of their Data Center platform customer base.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize that while inventory provisions had a negative impact on gross margin, the significant growth in revenue from consumer internet companies through the Compute & Networking segment helped offset this and contributed to the overall gross margin improvement."

      "question": "How does the introduction of the RTX 4080 GPU, as part of NVDA's product transitions, interact with supply chain risks and demand forecasting challenges to potentially impact NVDA's financial performance?",
      "answer": "The introduction of the RTX 4080 GPU is part of NVDA's broader product transitions, which are complex and may result in unanticipated quality or production issues, increasing inventory provisions, warranty costs, or causing product delays. These transitions are difficult to manage and may impair NVDA\u2019s ability to predict demand and impact supply mix, potentially leading to additional costs. Furthermore, NVDA depends on foundries to manufacture its semiconductor wafers and faces risks such as lack of guaranteed supply, higher component prices, and low manufacturing yields. These supply chain risks reduce NVDA\u2019s control over product quantity, quality, and delivery schedules. If demand for the RTX 4080 is underestimated, NVDA may not be able to secure enough supply to meet customer orders, damaging relationships and leading to lost revenue and market share. Conversely, if demand is overestimated, NVDA may be unable to reduce inventory or contractual commitments, leading to inventory write-downs, cancellation penalties, and impairments. These factors, combined with extended lead times and geopolitical tensions, may negatively impact NVDA\u2019s gross margins and financial results.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_b - NVDA's product transitions, such as the introduction of the RTX 4080, are complex and may result in unanticipated quality or production issues, increasing inventory provisions, warranty costs, or causing product delays.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - NVDA depends on foundries and subcontractors for manufacturing and faces risks such as lack of guaranteed supply, higher component prices, and low manufacturing yields, which reduce control over product quantity, quality, and delivery schedules.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The introduction of the RTX 4080 interacts with these supply chain risks, where underestimating demand may lead to supply shortages and lost revenue, while overestimating demand may result in inventory write-downs and impairments, both negatively impacting NVDA\u2019s gross margins and financial results."

      "answer": "Initial capacity constraints related to custom components directly impact Apple's ability to manage supply chain risks and maintain product availability because the company often relies on single-source suppliers for these components. As stated in the 10-K filing, when a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until suppliers' yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. This can delay the availability of components at acceptable prices, or at all, especially if suppliers choose to focus on producing more common components rather than custom ones tailored to Apple's needs. Additionally, Apple's reliance on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia for final assembly means that any disruption in the supply of these custom components can lead to delays in finished product shipments. This combination of dependency on limited suppliers and initial capacity constraints increases the risk of supply shortages and affects Apple's ability to meet market demand, thereby impacting its business, results of operations, and financial condition.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Apple uses custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products often utilize components available from only one source, with initial capacity constraints affecting availability until yields or capacities improve.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Apple's manufacturing is concentrated in Asia, and it depends on single or limited sources for certain components, making it vulnerable to industry-wide shortages and pricing fluctuations.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The combination of reliance on single-source suppliers and initial capacity constraints for custom components increases the risk of supply chain disruptions, which can delay product availability and negatively impact Apple's business performance."

          "chunk_text": "## The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\n\nSubstantially all of the Company's manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, T aiwan and V ietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company's direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company's flexibility to respond to changing conditions. A lthough arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., A sia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in A sia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company's hardware products. A ny failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company's cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, or conflict.\n\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be disrupted or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\n\nChanges or additions to the Company's supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties, including exposure to additional regulatory and operational risks.\n\n## Future operating results depend upon the Company's ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.\n\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. M any components,  including  those  that  are  available  from  multiple  sources,  are  at  times  subject  to  industry-wide  shortages  and  significant  commodity  pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply , which adversely affected the Company's ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.  Such  disruptions  could  occur  in  the  future.  While  the  Company  has  entered  into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. In addition, component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry , further limiting the Company's ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company's new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers' yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements. When the Company's supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company , the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company's business,  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition.  The  Company's  business  and  financial  performance  could  also  be  materially  adversely  affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.",

The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\n\n## Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\n\nAlthough most components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company , including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\n\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers' yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements.\n\nSubstantially all of the Company's hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.\n\n## Note 13 - Segment Information and G eographic Data\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments consist of the A mericas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of A sia Pacific. A mericas includes both North and South A merica. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the M iddle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and T aiwan. Rest of A sia Pacific includes A ustralia and those A sian countries not included in the Company's other reportable segments. A lthough the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company's customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region.\n\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company's retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment consists  of  net  sales  to  third  parties,  related  cost  of  sales,  and  operating  ex penses  directly   attributable  to  the  segment.

Intersegment revenue was $17.2 billion, down $799 million from 2023, driven primarily by lower intersegment ASPs, lower back-end services revenue, and higher intersegment credits. These intersegment decreases were partially offset by higher wafer volume primarily from Intel 3, Intel 4, and Intel 7 products. External revenue was $385 million, down $568 million from 2023, driven primarily by lower traditional packaging services and lower equipment sales.\n\n## 2023 vs. 2022\n\nRevenue was $18.9 billion, down $8.6 billion from 2022. Intersegment revenue was $18.0 billion, down $9.1 billion from 2022, driven primarily by lower intersegment volume.

Our IP portfolio includes patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, mask works, and other rights. We actively seek to protect our global IP rights and deter unauthorized use of our IP and other assets.\n\nWe have obtained patents in the US and other countries. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire, and in some cases our products may be obsolete before the patents are granted. A s we expand our product offerings, particularly around our foundry business, we also seek to extend our patent development efforts.

For example, architected into our Intel X eon processors are Intel Advanced Matrix Extensions (Intel AMX) for A I acceleration; Intel Software Guard Extensions (Intel SGX), providing enclaves of protected memory designed to deliver enhanced security for sensitive data; and Intel Crypto A cceleration, which is designed to deliver breakthrough performance across cryptographic algorithms. We believe this acceleration and performance will continue to drive our differentiated value and growth across our customer base. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\n## Products and Competition\n\nOur products and services include:\n\n- \u25a0 a portfolio of hardware, including Intel X eon processors, Intel Gaudi processors, and a software suite to enable the ecosystem and deliver solutions, including enterprise retrieval-augmented generation;\n- \u25a0 platform enabling and validation in partnership with OEM s, CSPs, and independent hardware and software vendors; and\n- \u25a0 optimized solutions for leading workloads such as A I, cryptography, security, storage, and networking, leveraging differentiated features supporting diverse compute environments.\n\nWe provide our customers with an extensive portfolio of silicon and software products, engineered to deliver workload-optimized performance. Our hardware portfolio primarily comprises CPUs and also includes accelerators, all designed to support the performance, agility, and security that our customers demand. Deployment of our silicon platforms is accelerated by a software development environment that enables workload mobility across our heterogeneous architectures and enables developers to execute their workloads on the hardware that best meets application requirements.\n\nOur competitors include hardware vendors such as AM D that compete with us across the full spectrum of CPUs, GPUs, accelerators, and other products; providers of GPU systems such as NVIDIA; companies developing their own custom silicon; and new entrants and incumbents developing ARM - and RISC-Vbased products customized for specific data center workloads. We expect this competitive landscape to continue to evolve.\n\nThe Intel X eon Scalable processor family delivers advanced CPUs for the data center, the network, and the edge, driving performance, manageability, and security with differentiated features and capabilities. In 2024, we launched the Intel X eon 6 processors with Efficient-cores (or E-Cores) and Performance-cores (or Pcores). Our E-core processors feature single-threaded cores for scale-out, parallel workloads, while our P-core processors feature hyperthreaded cores and built-in matrix  engines that are designed for more compute-intensive workloads such as A I.\n\nOur AI processor offerings consist of our Gaudi A I accelerators. In 2024, we launched the Intel Gaudi 3 A I accelerators with enhanced memory bandwidth, flex ibility , and A I compute capabilities. We were dev eloping Falcon Shores as our next-generation A I accelerator to succeed the Gaudi product line; however, based on customer feedback we will utilize it as an internal test chip rather than bring it to market. We are focusing our efforts on the development of our Jaguar Shores AI accelerator, previously targeted to succeed Falcon Shores, as our first generally programmable GPU A I accelerator offering to customers.\n\nThe ubiquity of Intel X eon processors in the installed base, along with our heterogeneous compute solutions combined with software that unlocks the value of our hardware, enable our customers to develop highly differentiated solutions. Our integrated approach has created significant value for Intel, our customers, and our partners by helping us mitigate risks, reduce costs, build brand value, and identify new market opportunities to apply our technology to address our customers' and society's most complex issues.\n\nMD&amp;A",

With each new node, we seek improvements in performance, power efficiency, cost, and siz e to meet the needs of our products and of external foundry customers. The continued development of leading-edge nodes that are competitive with the offerings of other foundries requires significant ongoing capital investment as we pursue incremental improvements and refinements of existing transistor and layout designs and manufacturing technologies, such as EUV  lithography, while also pursuing new transistor and layout designs, such as gate-all-around and backside power in our upcoming Intel 18A  process node, and new manufacturing technologies, such as high-NA EUV lithography for use in our upcoming Intel 14A process node.\n\nAs of the end of 2024, a significant majority of our products were manufactured using our Intel 7 process node in A rizona and Israel, we successfully ramped our Intel 4 and Intel 3 process nodes as our first EUV  lithography nodes and shifted high-volume production of those nodes to Ireland, and we canceled the productization of our Intel 20A  process node to focus efforts on the improved version of the node, Intel 18A , that we expect to put into high-volume production in 2025 with our new client family of products code-named Panther Lake.\n\nOur Capital\n\n8",

          "chunk_text": "- Intel 4, our first EUV  lithography  node, deliv ers significant density  scaling and approx imately  20% performance-per-watt improvement over Intel 7. The Intel Core Ultra processor is our first high-volume client product on Intel 4 and began shipping to customers in 2023. Intel 4 moved to high-volume manufacturing in Ireland in 2024, and is expected to represent an increasing portion of our processor production and products in 2025.\n- Intel 3, our second EUV  lithography node, delivers further logic scaling and up to 18% performance-per-watt improvement over Intel 4. Intel 3 is offered to external foundry customers and is optimized for the needs of data center products. This node, which is produced in the same facilities as Intel 4, was in high-volume manufacturing in Oregon during 2024, with high-volume manufacturing shifted to Ireland for 2025. Intel's X eon 6 Scalable server processor offerings are built on this technology.\n- Intel 18A  is our nex t generation leading-edge process technology and has been designed to incorporate the first high volume commercial implementation of two breakthrough technologies: gate-all-around transistors and backside power. RibbonFET, our implementation of a gate-all-around transistor, is designed to deliver faster transistor switching speeds while achieving the same drive current as multiple fins, but in a smaller footprint. PowerVia is our unique industry-first implementation of backside power delivery that is designed to optimize signal transmission by eliminating the need for power routing on the front side of the wafer. Intel 18A  is offered to ex ternal foundry  customers and is designed to deliver improvements in performance per watt and density scaling over Intel 3. We expect to commence high-volume manufacturing of Panther Lake, our new client family of products and our first processors on Intel 18A , in 2025.\n- Intel 14A , our third adv anced process technology offering to external customers, is in active development with performance-per-watt and density scaling improvements over Intel 18A.\n\n## IP Rights\n\nWe own and develop significant IP and related IP rights around the world that support our products, services, R&amp;D, and other activities and assets. Our IP portfolio includes patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, mask works, and other rights. We actively seek to protect our global IP rights and deter unauthorized use of our IP and other assets.\n\nWe have obtained patents in the US and other countries. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire, and in some cases our products may be obsolete before the patents are granted. A s we expand our product offerings, particularly around our foundry business, we also seek to extend our patent development efforts. In addition to developing patents based on our own R&amp;D efforts, we may purchase or license patents from third parties.\n\nThe software that we distribute, including software embedded in our products, is entitled to copyright and other IP protection. To distinguish our products from our competitors' products, we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products, and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine Intel components. We also protect details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.\n\nEfforts to protect our IP can be difficult, particularly  in countries that prov ide less protection to IP rights and in the absence of harmoniz ed international IP standards. Competitors and others may already have IP rights covering similar products. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain IP rights covering our own products or that we will be able to obtain IP licenses from other companies on favorable terms or at all. For a discussion of IP-related risks, see \"Risk Factors\" within Risk Factors and Other Key Information.

In a multicloud environment, customers have to reimagine how they design, develop and deploy their applications. They need to be able to build applications quickly, deploy them nearly anywhere, monitor experiences, and act in real time.\n\nWe  believe  we  are  uniquely  positioned  to  enable  successful  business  outcomes  for  customers  in  hybrid  and  multicloud environments. In our view, networks are increasingly critical to business success and we believe our customers will benefit from the insights and intelligence that we are making accessible through our highly differentiated platforms.\n\nWe  are  continuing  our  commitment  to  deliver  full  stack  observability  from  the  application  to  the  infrastructure  to  give  our customers  greater  insights  that  enable  faster,  better  decision  making.  We  are  doing  this  through  adding  key  elements  to  our portfolio, such as: infrastructure optimization with Intersight, network monitoring with technology from ThousandEyes, application performance monitoring with AppDynamics, as well as our security innovations.\n\n## Power Hybrid Work\n\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic began, the world has shifted to a hybrid work environment, and we believe that our customers are looking  to  support  a  blend  of  onsite  and  offsite  workers.  To  enable  a  hybrid  workforce,  customers  require  secure  access, collaboration, and technologies to empower their teams to connect seamlessly and to work from anywhere.\n\nCustomers are looking to us to help improve how their people communicate, collaborate and to increase productivity. At Cisco, we are focused on providing and delivering highly secure collaboration experiences to help our customers create a secure hybrid work environment.\n\nWe  believe  our  collaboration  portfolio,  which  includes  our  subscription-based  Webex  conferencing  platform,  with  meetings, devices,  calling  and  messaging,  is  at  the  center  of  our  customers'  strategy  for  enabling  their  teams  to  be  more  productive  and secure. To help our customers transform their workplaces, we continue to invest to expand our capabilities by introducing new Webex Calling innovations in the Webex Suite to improve work flexibility, reliability, and quality. Additionally, we also launched new devices for hybrid work - the Webex Room Bar and a Cisco Video Phone.\n\n## Transform Infrastructure\n\nIn an increasingly digital and connected world, where each new connection to the Internet puts more demand on the network, our customers are looking to modernize and transform their infrastructure in an automated way in order to manage and monitor each connection in real time. Our strategy to help our customers transform their infrastructure with the network at the core began with Software-Defined Access (SD-Access) technology, one of our leading enterprise architectures, and continued with the launch of our Catalyst 9000 series of switches.\n\nWe  have  continued  to  transform  our  enterprise  access  portfolio  by  bringing  together  several  technologies  to  form  the  only integrated architecture with built-in simplicity, automation and security at the foundation. This architecture is designed to enable our customers to securely connect their users and devices to applications and data over any network, no matter where they are.\n\nWe  have  introduced  several  innovations  that  extend  our  networking  capabilities  to  wireless  and  enterprise  routing  products, including Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) and Internet of Things (IoT) edge platforms. Our SD-WAN solutions are designed to provide direct branch to cloud connectivity, enabling the workforce to access their software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications  and  workloads  in  an  optimized  and  highly  secure  manner.  We  have  continued  to  expand  our  SD-WAN  offering, through  our  Cloud  OnRamp  integrations  with  several  webscale  providers  to  deliver  predictable  and  highly  secure  application experiences.\n\nTo further our innovation in this area, we are applying the latest technologies, such as machine learning and advanced analytics, to operate  and  enhance  network  capabilities.  These  network  product  offerings  are  designed  to  help  enable  customers  to  detect cybersecurity threats, even in encrypted traffic. As such, we have created, in our view, the only network that is designed for security while also helping to maintain privacy.\n\nOur customers are operating in multicloud environments with private, public and hybrid clouds. For the data center, our strategy is to deliver multicloud architectures that bring policy and operational consistency, regardless of where applications or data reside, by extending our Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) and our hyperconverged offerings. We continue to invest in our data center portfolio  to  help  meet  the  growing  demand  for  cloud-delivered  technologies.  Our  recently  launched  Nexus  Cloud  platform  is designed to help our customers deploy, manage, and operate their data center networks from the cloud.",

      "answer": "NVIDIA's $500 million Notes Due 2060 is one of several long-term debt obligations that collectively total $11 billion. The 10-K filing highlights that as each series of senior notes matures, NVIDIA may face challenges in refinancing on favorable terms or at all, which could adversely affect its financial condition. Specifically, maintaining this level of indebtedness requires NVIDIA to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flows from operations toward debt service obligations and principal repayments. This allocation limits NVIDIA's flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its business and industry, impairs its ability to obtain future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other corporate purposes, and increases vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic conditions. Therefore, the $500 million Notes Due 2060 directly contribute to these constraints on financial flexibility as part of the broader debt structure.",

We may be required to incur significant expense to comply with changes in, or remedy violations of, these laws and regulations.\n\n## Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows from operations, and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations.\n\nAs of January 30, 2022, we had outstanding a total of $11 billion in notes due by 2060. As each series of senior notes matures, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased, we have to repay or refinance the notes. If we decide to refinance, we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the notes at all, both of which may adversely affect our financial condition. We also have a $575 million commercial paper program.\n\nMaintenance of our indebtedness and contractual restrictions, and future issuances of indebtedness could cause us to dedicate  a  substantial  portion  of  our  cash  flows  from  operations  towards  debt  service  obligations  and  principal repayments; increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; impair our ability to obtain future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes; and restrict our  ability  to  grant  liens  on  property,  enter  into  certain  mergers,  dispose  of  all  or  substantially  all  of  our  assets,  or materially change our business.\n\nWe are required to comply with the covenants set forth in our indenture and our ability to comply may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the note holders or lenders, then any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable.

Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult  for  a  third  party  to  acquire  a  majority  of  our  outstanding  voting  stock. These  provisions include the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock, change the number of directors, and to make, amend or repeal our bylaws without prior shareholder approval; the inability of our shareholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings; advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals; and a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. In 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft to develop and sell graphics chips and license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox. Under the agreement, if someone makes an offer to purchase at least 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. These provisions could delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA, discourage proxy contests, and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.\n\n## ITEM 1B.

          "chunk_text": "position.  Our AI  technology leadership is reinforced by our large and expanding ecosystem in a virtuous cycle. Our GPU platforms are available from virtually every major server maker and cloud service provider, as well as on our own AI supercomputer. There are almost 3 million developers worldwide using CUDA and our other software tools to help deploy our technology in our target markets. We evangelize AI through partnerships with hundreds of universities and almost 10,000 startups through our Inception program. Additionally, our Deep Learning Institute provides instruction on the  latest  techniques  on  how  to  design,  train,  and  deploy  neural  networks  in  applications  using  our  accelerated computing platform.\n\nExtending our technology and platform leadership in computer graphics. We believe that computer graphics is fundamental  to  the  continued  expansion  and  evolution  of  computing.  We  apply  our  research  and  development resources to enhance the user experience for consumer entertainment and professional visualization applications, and create new virtual world and simulation capabilities. Our technologies are instrumental in driving gaming forward, as developers leverage our libraries and algorithms to deliver an optimized gaming experience on our GeForce platform. Our computer graphics platforms  leverage  not  only  our  industry-leading  GeForce  and  NVIDIA  RTX  GPUs,  but  also optimized software stacks. For example, GeForce Experience enhances each gamer's experience by optimizing their PC's settings, as well as enabling the recording and sharing of gameplay. Our Studio drivers enhance and accelerate a number of popular creative applications. Omniverse is real-time 3D design collaboration and virtual world simulation software that empowers artists, designers and creators to connect and collaborate in leading design applications. We also enable interactive graphics applications - such as games, movie and photo editing and design software - to be accessed  by  almost  any  device,  almost  anywhere,  through  our  cloud  platforms  such  as  vGPU  for  enterprise  and GeForce NOW for gaming.\n\nAdvancing  the  leading  autonomous  vehicle  platform. We  believe  the  advent  of  AV  will  soon  revolutionize  the transportation industry. In our view, AI is the key technology enabler of this opportunity, as the algorithms required for autonomous  driving  -  such  as  perception,  localization,  and  planning  -  are  too  complex  for  legacy  hand-coded approaches and will run on multiple trained neural networks instead. Therefore, we provide a full functionally safe AIbased hardware and software solution for the AV market under the DRIVE brand, which we are bringing to market through our partnerships with automotive original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, tier-1 suppliers, and start-ups. Our AV solution also includes the GPU-based hardware required to train the neural networks before their in-vehicle deployment,  as  well  as  to  re-simulate  their  operation  prior  to  any  over-the-air  software  updates.  We  believe  our comprehensive, top-to-bottom and end-to-end approach will enable the transportation industry to solve the complex problems arising from the shift to autonomous driving.\n\nLeveraging  our  intellectual  property,  or  IP. We believe  our  IP  is  a  valuable  asset  that  can  be  accessed  by  our customers  and  partners  through  license  and  development  agreements  when  they  desire  to  build  such  capabilities directly  into  their  own  products,  or  have  us  do  so  through  a  custom  development.  Such  license  and  development arrangements can further enhance the reach of our technology.\n\n## Sales and Marketing\n\nOur  worldwide  sales  and  marketing  strategy  is  key  to  achieving  our  objective  of  providing  markets  with  our  highperformance and efficient computing platforms and software. Our sales and marketing teams, located across our global markets, work closely with end customers and various industry ecosystems through our partner network. Our partner network incorporates each industry's respective OEMs, original device manufacturers, or ODMs, system builders, addin  board  manufacturers,  or  AIBs,  retailers/distributors,  ISVs,  internet  and  cloud  service  providers,  automotive manufacturers and tier-1 automotive suppliers, mapping companies, start-ups, and other ecosystem participants.\n\nMembers of our sales team have technical expertise and product and industry knowledge. We also employ a team of application engineers and solution architects to assist our partner network in designing, testing, and qualifying system designs that incorporate our platforms. We believe that the depth and quality of our design support are key to improving our partner network's time-to-market, maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction, and fostering relationships that encourage our end customers and partner network to use the next generation of our products within each platform.\n\nTo  encourage  the  development  of  applications  optimized  for  our  platforms  and  software,  we  seek  to  establish  and maintain strong relationships in the software development community. Engineering and marketing personnel engage with  key  software  developers  to  promote  and  discuss  our  platforms,  as  well  as  to  ascertain  individual  product requirements and solve technical problems. Our developer program makes our products available to developers prior to launch in order to encourage the development of AI frameworks, SDKs, and APIs for software applications and game titles  that  are  optimized  for  our  platforms.  Our  Deep  Learning  Institute  provides  in-person  and  online  training  for developers in industries and organizations around the world to build AI and accelerated computing applications that leverage our platforms.",

Leveraging our technology leadership in AI and building on our long-standing automotive relationships, we are delivering a complete end-to-end solution for the AV market under the DRIVE brand. NVIDIA has demonstrated multiple applications of AI within the car: AI can drive the car itself as a pilot in fully autonomous mode or it can also be a co-pilot, assisting the human driver while creating a safer driving experience.\n\nNVIDIA is working with several hundred partners in the automotive ecosystem including automakers, truck makers, tierone  suppliers,  sensor  manufacturers,  automotive  research  institutions,  HD  mapping  companies,  and  startups  to develop and deploy AI systems for self-driving vehicles. Our unified AI computing architecture starts with training deep neural networks using our GPUs, and then running a full perception, planning and control stack within the vehicle on the NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion platform. The DRIVE Hyperion platform consists of the high-performance, energy efficient DRIVE AGX computing hardware, a reference sensor set that supports full self-driving capability as well as an open, modular  DRIVE  Software  platform.  We  recently  announced  for  future  release  the  DRIVE  Software  platform  that includes DRIVE Chauffeur - based on NVIDIA DRIVE AV software to enable autonomous driving, mapping and parking services; and Drive Concierge - based on NVIDIA DRIVE IX software for intelligent in-vehicle experiences and NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar software for real time conversational AI capability.\n\nNVIDIA DRIVE can perceive and understand in real-time what is happening around the vehicle, precisely locate itself on an HD map, and plan a safe path forward. This advanced self-driving car platform combines deep learning, sensor fusion, and surround vision to change the driving experience. Our DRIVE platform scales from a palm-sized, energyefficient module for automated highway-driving capabilities to a configuration with multiple systems aimed at enabling driverless  cars.  Our  newest  system-on-a-chip,  or  SoC,  Orin,  which  started  shipping  in  fiscal  year  2022,  enables vehicles  to  use  deep  neural  networks  to  process  data  from  multiple  cameras  and  sensors.  It  powers  the  DRIVE AutoPilot, NVIDIA's automated driving solution, combining the DRIVE AV self-driving solution with the DRIVE IX cockpit software, including a visualization system for allowing the driver to see what the car sees and plans to do.\n\nIn addition, we offer a scalable data center-based simulation solution, NVIDIA DRIVE Constellation running DRIVE Sim software, for testing and validating a self-driving platform before commercial deployment. NVIDIA's unique end-to-end, software-defined approach is designed for continuous innovation and continuous development, enabling cars to receive over-the-air updates to add new features and capabilities throughout the life of a vehicle.\n\n## Business Strategies\n\nNVIDIA's key strategies that shape our overall business approach include:\n\nAdvancing  the  NVIDIA  accelerated  computing  platform. NVIDIA's  accelerated  computing  platform  can  solve complex  problems  in  significantly  less  time  and  with  lower  power  consumption  than  alternative  computational approaches. Indeed, it can help solve problems that were previously deemed unsolvable. We work to deliver continued performance leaps that outpace Moore's Law by leveraging innovation across the architecture, chip design, system, and  software  layers.  With  our  acquisition  of  Mellanox,  we  strengthened  our  end-to-end  expertise  in  data  center architectures, positioning us for a future when the data center is the new unit of computing. This full-stack innovation approach allows us to deliver order-of-magnitude performance advantages relative to legacy approaches in our target markets,  which  include  Gaming,  Data  Center,  Professional  Visualization,  and  Automotive.  While  the  computing requirements of these end markets are diverse, we address them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs and CUDA as the fundamental building blocks. The programmable nature of our architecture allows us to make leveraged  investments  in  R&amp;D:  we  can  support  several  multi-billion-dollar  end  markets  with  the  same  underlying technology by using a variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third party developers and partners. We utilize this platform approach in each of our target markets.\n\nExtending  our  technology  and  platform  leadership  in  AI. We  provide  a  complete,  end-to-end  accelerated computing platform for deep learning and machine learning, addressing both training and inferencing. This includes GPUs, interconnects, systems, our CUDA programming language, algorithms, libraries, and other software. GPUs are uniquely suited to AI, and we will continue to add AI-specific features to our GPU architecture to further extend our leadership",

      "question": "How does the interest rate of the 6.50% Debentures due 2028 compare to the interest rates of other debentures in IBM's capital structure, and what might this indicate about IBM's long-term financing strategy?",
      "answer": "The 6.50% Debentures due 2028 have a higher interest rate than the 6.22% Debentures due 2027 and lower than the 7.00% Debentures due 2025 and 2045. This indicates that IBM has issued debentures at varying interest rates over different time horizons, potentially to manage refinancing risk and optimize capital costs depending on market conditions at the time of issuance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The table lists the interest rates and maturity years of IBM's various debentures, including the 6.50% Debentures due 2028, 6.22% Debentures due 2027, 7.00% Debentures due 2025, and 7.00% Debentures due 2045.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The 6.50% Debentures due 2028 are referenced as a distinct financial instrument with specific rights defined in Exhibit 2 to Form8-K, filed on January 8, 1998.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Comparing the interest rates and maturity dates from both sources reveals that IBM has issued debentures with varying yields over time, suggesting a strategic approach to financing based on market conditions and long-term capital needs."

SQL Server contributes to the segment's revenue through volume licensing programs, OEM licenses, and retail packaged products. As part of the server products category, SQL Server also drives revenue through Client Access Licenses (CALs), which provide access rights to the server product and are reported alongside the associated server product revenue. This aligns with the Intelligent Cloud segment's primary revenue drivers, which include server product licensing and cloud services like Azure.",

This segment primarily comprises:\n\n- Server products and cloud services, including Azure and other cloud services; SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses ('CALs'); and Nuance and GitHub.\n- Enterprise Services, including Enterprise Support Services, Microsoft Consulting Services, and Nuance professional services.\n\n## Server Products and Cloud Services\n\nAzure is a comprehensive set of cloud services that offer developers, IT professionals, and enterprises freedom to build, deploy, and manage applications on any platform  or  device.  Customers  can  use Azure  through  our  global  network  of  datacenters  for computing, networking, storage, mobile and web application services, AI, IoT, cognitive services, and machine learning. Azure enables customers to devote more resources to development and use of applications that benefit their organizations, rather than managing on-premises hardware and software. Azure revenue is mainly affected by infrastructure-as-a-service and platform-as-aservice consumption-based services, and per user-based services such as Enterprise Mobility + Security.\n\nOur server products are designed to make IT professionals, developers, and their systems more productive and efficient. Server software is integrated server infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the Windows Server operating  system.  This  includes  the  server  platform,  database,  business  intelligence,  storage,  management  and  operations, virtualization,  service-oriented  architecture  platform,  security,  and  identity  software.  We  also  license  standalone  and  software development lifecycle tools for software architects, developers, testers, and project managers. GitHub provides a collaboration platform  and  code  hosting  service  for  developers.  Server  products  revenue  is  mainly  affected  by  purchases  through  volume licensing  programs,  licenses  sold  to  original  equipment  manufacturers  ('OEM'),  and  retail  packaged  products.  CALs  provide access  rights  to  certain  server  products,  including  SQL  Server  and  Windows  Server,  and  revenue  is  reported  along  with  the associated server product.\n\nNuance and GitHub include both cloud and on-premises offerings. Nuance provides healthcare and enterprise AI solutions. GitHub provides a collaboration platform and code hosting service for developers.\n\n## Enterprise Services\n\nEnterprise  Services,  including  Enterprise  Support  Services,  Microsoft  Consulting  Services,  and  Nuance  Professional  Services, assist  customers  in  developing,  deploying,  and  managing  Microsoft  server  solutions,  Microsoft  desktop  solutions,  and  Nuance conversational  AI  and  ambient  intelligent  solutions,  along  with  providing  training  and  certification  to  developers  and  IT professionals on various Microsoft products.\n\n## Competition\n\nAzure faces diverse competition from companies such as Amazon, Google, IBM, Oracle, VMware, and open source offerings. Our Enterprise Mobility + Security offerings also compete with products from a range of competitors including identity vendors, security solution vendors, and numerous other security point solution vendors. Azure's competitive advantage includes enabling a hybrid cloud, allowing deployment of existing datacenters with our public cloud into a single, cohesive infrastructure, and the ability to run at a scale that meets the needs of businesses of all sizes and complexities. We believe our cloud's global scale, coupled with our broad portfolio of identity and security solutions, allows us to effectively solve complex cybersecurity challenges for our customers and differentiates us from the competition.\n\nOur server products face competition from a wide variety of server operating systems and applications offered by companies with a range of market approaches. Vertically integrated computer manufacturers such as Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and Oracle offer their own  versions  of  the  Unix  operating  system  preinstalled  on  server  hardware.  Nearly  all  computer  manufacturers  offer  server hardware for the Linux operating system and many contribute to Linux operating system development. The competitive position of Linux  has  also  benefited  from  the  large  number  of  compatible  applications  now  produced  by  many  commercial  and  noncommercial software developers. A number of companies, such as Red Hat, supply versions of Linux.",

The  recast  of  these  prior  period amounts  had  no  impact  on  our  consolidated  balance  sheets,  consolidated  income  statements,  or  consolidated  cash  flows statements.\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of  Microsoft  Corporation  and  its  subsidiaries.  Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\n## Estimates and Assumptions\n\nPreparing  financial  statements  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the  nature  and  timing  of  satisfaction  of  performance  obligations,  and  determining  the  standalone  selling  price  ('SSP')  of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for,  our  inventory;  stock-based  compensation  forfeiture  rates;  when  technological  feasibility  is  achieved  for  our  products;  the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management's estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.\n\nIn  July  2022,  we  completed  an  assessment  of  the  useful  lives  of  our  server  and  network  equipment.  Due  to  investments  in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. This change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2023. We had previously increased the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment in July 2020.\n\n## Foreign Currencies\n\nAssets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses  are  translated  at  average  rates  of  exchange  prevailing  during  the  year.  Translation  adjustments  resulting  from  this process are recorded to other comprehensive income.\n\n## Revenue\n\n## Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue\n\nProduct  revenue  includes  sales  from  operating  systems,  cross-device  productivity  applications,  server  applications,  business solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, video games, and hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories.\n\nService and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and Xbox; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn.",

We have broadened our approach to how we think about gaming end-to-end,  from  the  way  games  are  created  and  distributed  to  how  they  are  played,  including  cloud  gaming  so  players  can stream across PC, console, and mobile. We have a strong position with our large and growing highly engaged community of gamers, including the acquisition of ZeniMax Media Inc., the parent company of Bethesda Softworks LLC. In January 2022, we announced  plans  to  acquire Activision  Blizzard,  Inc.,  a  leader  in  game  development  and  an  interactive  entertainment  content publisher. Xbox Game Pass is a community with access to a curated library of over 100 first- and third-party console and PC titles. Xbox Cloud Gaming is Microsoft's game streaming technology that is complementary to our console hardware and gives fans the ultimate choice to play the games they want, with the people they want, on the devices they want.\n\n## Our Future Opportunity\n\nThe case for digital transformation has never been more urgent. Customers are looking to us to help improve productivity and the affordability of their products and services. We continue to develop complete, intelligent solutions for our customers that empower people to stay productive and collaborate, while safeguarding businesses and simplifying IT management. Our goal is to lead the industry in several distinct areas of technology over the long term, which we expect will translate to sustained growth. We are investing significant resources in:\n\n- Transforming the workplace to deliver new modern, modular business applications, drive deeper insights, and improve how people communicate, collaborate, learn, work, play, and interact with one another.\n- Building and running cloud-based services in ways that unleash new experiences and opportunities for businesses and individuals.\n- Applying AI to drive insights and act on our customer's behalf by understanding and interpreting their needs using natural methods of communication.\n- Tackling security from all angles with our integrated, end-to-end solutions spanning security, compliance, identity, and management, across all clouds and platforms.\n- Inventing new gaming experiences that bring people together around their shared love for games on any devices and pushing the boundaries of innovation with console and PC gaming by creating the next wave of entertainment.\n- Using Windows to fuel our cloud business, grow our share of the PC market, and drive increased engagement with our services like Microsoft 365 Consumer, Teams, Edge, Bing, Xbox Game Pass, and more.\n\nOur future growth depends on our ability to transcend current product category definitions, business models, and sales motions. We have the opportunity to redefine what customers and partners can expect and are working to deliver new solutions that reflect the best of Microsoft.\n\n## Corporate Social Responsibility\n\n## Commitment to Sustainability\n\nWe work to ensure that technology is inclusive, trusted, and increases sustainability. We are accelerating progress toward a more sustainable future by reducing our environmental footprint, advancing research, helping our customers build sustainable solutions, and advocating for policies that benefit the environment. In January 2020, we announced a bold commitment and detailed plan to be carbon negative by 2030, and to remove from the environment by 2050 all the carbon we have emitted since our founding in 1975. This included a commitment to invest $1 billion over four years in new technologies and innovative climate solutions. We built  on  this  pledge  by  adding  commitments  to  be  water  positive  by  2030,  zero  waste  by  2030,  and  to  protect  ecosystems  by developing a Planetary Computer. We also help our suppliers and customers around the world use Microsoft technology to reduce their own carbon footprint.\n\nFiscal year 2021 was a year of both successes and challenges. While we continued to make progress on several of our goals, with an overall reduction in our combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, our Scope 3 emissions increased, due in substantial part to significant  global  datacenter  expansions and growth in Xbox sales and usage as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite these Scope 3 increases, we will continue to build the foundations and do the work to deliver on our commitments, and help our customers and partners achieve theirs. We have learned the impact of our work will not all be felt immediately, and our experience highlights how progress won't always be linear.",

      "answer": "The 2018 Director Compensation Plan had 1,745,284 shares available for future issuance, which contributes to the company's ability to provide equity-based compensation to directors. This availability enhances flexibility in structuring director compensation, especially when considered alongside the 2024 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which had 33,049,176 shares remaining for future issuance and covered both directors and executives. The presence of multiple plans with available shares allows Texas Instruments to tailor compensation packages using restricted stock units, options, or other stock-based awards, ensuring alignment with long-term strategic goals and executive retention.",

Postretirement benefit plans\n\n## Plan descriptions\n\nWe have various employee retirement plans, including defined contribution, defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans. For qualifying employees, we offer deferred compensation arrangements.\n\n## U.S. retirement plans\n\nOur principal retirement plans in the United States are a defined contribution plan, an enhanced defined contribution plan and qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans. The defined benefit plans were closed to new participants in 1997, and then current participants were allowed to make a one-time election to continue accruing a benefit in the plans or to cease accruing a benefit and instead to participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan.\n\nBoth defined contribution plans offer an employer-matching sav ings option that allows employees to make pretax and post-tax contributions to v arious inv estment choices. Employees who elected to continue accruing a benefit in the qualified defined benefit pension plans may also participate in the defined contribution plan, where employer-matching contributions are prov ided for up to 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings. Employees who elected not to continue accruing a benefit in the defined benefit pension plans and employees hired after Nov ember 1997 and through December 31, 2003, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. This plan prov ides for a fixed employer contribution of 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings, plus an employer-matching contribution of up to 4% of the employee's annual eligible earnings. Employees hired after December 31, 2003, do not receiv e the fixed employer contribution of 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, as a result of employees' elections, TI's U.S. defined contribution plans held shares of TI common stock totaling 5 million shares in both periods v alued at $852 million and $873 million, respectiv ely. Div idends paid on these shares in 2024 and 2023 were $26 million and $27 million, respectiv ely. Effectiv e April 1, 2016, the TI common stock fund was frozen to new contributions or transfers into the fund.\n\nOur aggregate expense for the U.S. defined contribution plans was $76 million, $75 million and $70 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectiv ely.\n\nThe defined benefit pension plans include employees still accruing benefits, as well as employees and participants who no longer accrue serv ice-related benefits, but instead, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. Benefits under the qualified defined benefit pension plan are determined using a formula based on years of serv ice and the highest fiv e consecutiv e years of compensation.

We provided a financial guarantee in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 to satisfy the obligation in lieu of cash payment while we appeal the EC's decision. The fine is accruing interest at a rate of 1.50% per annum while it is outstanding and included in other current liabilities.\n\nEuropean Commission (EC) Investigation: On October 15, 2014, the EC notified us that it was conducting an investigation of us relating to Articles 101 and/or 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). On January 24, 2018, the EC issued a decision finding that pursuant to an agreement with Apple Inc. we paid significant amounts to Apple on the condition that it exclusively use our baseband chipsets in its smartphones and tablets, reducing Apple's incentives to source baseband chipsets from our competitors and harming competition and innovation for certain baseband chipsets, and imposed a fine of 997 million euros. On April 6, 2018, we filed an appeal of the EC's decision with the General Court of the European Union. From May 4, 2021 to May 6, 2021, a hearing on our appeal was held before the court. On June 15, 2022, the court issued a ruling annulling the EC's decision in its entirety. The deadline for the EC to appeal the General Court's decision to the European Court of Justice expired in August 2022. Consequently, the case is now over.\n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded a charge of $1.2 billion to other expenses related to this EC fine. We provided financial guarantees in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 to satisfy the obligation in lieu of cash payment while we appealed the EC's decision. The fine accrued interest at a rate of 1.50% per annum while it was outstanding. In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we designated the liability as a hedge of our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries, with gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of the foreign currency translation adjustment. As a result of the General Court's ruling, in the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we recorded a $1.1 billion benefit in other income and a $62 million reduction in interest expense resulting from the reversal of the accrued fine and the associated interest previously recorded.\n\nContingent Losses and Other Considerations: We will continue to vigorously defend ourselves in the foregoing matters. However, litigation and investigations are inherently uncertain, and we face difficulties in evaluating or estimating likely outcomes or ranges of possible loss, particularly in antitrust and trade regulation investigations. Other than with respect to the EC fine related to the Icera Complaint to the European Commission, we have not recorded any accrual at September 25, 2022 for contingent losses associated with these matters based on our belief that losses, while reasonably possible, are not probable. Further, any possible amount or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. The unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. We are engaged in numerous other legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of our business (for example, proceedings relating to employment matters or the initiation or defense of proceedings relating to intellectual property rights) and, while there can be no assurance, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these other legal actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\nIndemnifications . We generally do not indemnify our customers, licensees and suppliers for losses sustained from infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. However, we are contingently liable under certain agreements to defend and/or indemnify certain customers, licensees and suppliers against certain types of liability and/or damages arising from the infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. Our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time and/or amount, and in some instances, we may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us. Claims and reimbursements under indemnification arrangements have not been material to our consolidated financial statements. We have not recorded accruals for certain claims under indemnification arrangements based on our belief that additional liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, any possible range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\n\nPurchase Obligations . We have agreements with suppliers and other parties to purchase inventory, other goods and services and long-lived assets. Such agreements include multi-year capacity purchase commitments with certain suppliers of our integrated circuit products. Total advance payments related to multi-year capacity commitments recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at September 25, 2022 and September 26, 2021 were $3.8 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, of which $701 million and $90 million were recorded in other current assets, respectively, and $3.1 billion and $1.6 billion were recorded in other assets, respectively. Integrated circuit product inventory obligations represent purchase commitments (including those under multi-year capacity purchase commitments to the extent such minimum amounts are both fixed and determinable) for raw materials, semiconductor die, finished goods and manufacturing services, such as wafer bump, probe, assembly and final test. Under our manufacturing relationships with our foundry suppliers and assembly and test service providers, cancellation of outstanding purchase commitments is generally allowed but may result in the payment of costs incurred through the date of cancellation, and in some cases, incremental fees and/or the loss of amounts paid in advance related to capacity underutilization and the failure to meet future minimum purchase volumes under multi-year capacity purchase commitments. Obligations under our purchase agreements, which primarily relate to integrated circuit product inventory obligations, at September 25, 2022 totaled $24.5 billion of which, $13.3 billion is expected to be paid in the next 12 months.\n\nOperating Leases. We lease certain of our land, facilities and equipment under operating leases, with terms ranging from less than one year to 20 years, some of which include options to extend for up to 20 years. At September 25, 2022 and September 26, 2021, the weighted-average remaining lease term for operating leases were eight years and seven years, respectively. Operating lease expense for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $207 million, $203 million and $181 million,",

Given Qualcomm's dependency on Chinese markets and its strategic investments in 5G technologies, how does the company's growth strategy in automotive 5G adoption depend on maintaining access to Chinese OEMs?",
      "answer": "Qualcomm's growth strategy in automotive 5G adoption hinges on maintaining access to Chinese OEMs because the company projects that 60% of vehicles produced in 2028 will feature 5G connectivity, a market it aims to serve through its 5G technology investments. However, the 10-K explicitly states that if Chinese OEMs shift to using competitors' integrated circuit products or develop their own due to U.S. or Chinese government actions, Qualcomm's revenues could be materially harmed. Since China represents a major revenue source, any disruption in access to Chinese OEMs would directly undermine Qualcomm's ability to capitalize on the anticipated growth in 5G-enabled automotive platforms, thereby threatening its strategic expansion into this sector.",

          "chunk_text": "Consumer demand for new experiences, combined with the needs of mobile operators and device manufacturers to provide differentiated features and services, is driving continued innovation within the smartphone across connectivity, processing, AI, multimedia, imaging, audio and more. As a result, the smartphone continues to be the go-to device for social networking, music and video streaming, photography and video capture, e-commerce, gaming, email, web browsing and more. 5G enables these experiences to be more immersive, intuitive and interactive.\n\nTransforming Other Industries: Automotive. According to analyst data, more than 70% of new vehicles produced in 2028 are projected to have embedded cellular connectivity, with 60% of cellular connected vehicles featuring 5G connectivity. By comparison, 60% of vehicles produced in 2021 had embedded cellular connectivity, with 5G connectivity expected to ramp in 2023 (Strategy Analytics, October 2022).\n\nDigitalization of the automotive cockpit continues to transform the in-vehicle experience, enabling greater personalization of content and settings for both drivers and passengers as automakers respond to growing interest from consumers to bring their digital lifestyles into the vehicle. Car-to-cloud platforms are helping automakers improve cost efficiencies, create new service opportunities throughout the lifecycle of a vehicle with over-the-air (OTA) update capabilities and valuable vehicle and usage analytics. This is driving the development of a new architecture for the software-defined vehicle. High-performance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are being used to improve vehicles with advanced driver assistance and automated driving features that we expect to scale across vehicle tiers and continue the progression toward higher levels of autonomy, safety and convenience. Analysts estimate that 19% of new vehicles sold globally in 2025 will have Level 2 (i.e., partial driving automation) or higher autonomy, compared to an estimated 9% of new vehicles sold globally in 2022 (Strategy Analytics, October 2022).\n\nTransforming Other Industries: IoT. Demand for connected devices beyond smartphones continued to grow across consumer, edge networking and industrial applications in fiscal 2022, in part due to the expanded use cases enabled by 5G technologies. The installed base of IoT devices, which includes everything from wearables to industrial handhelds to gateways, is projected to more than double between 2022 and 2026 to over 27 billion (IoT Analytics, October 2022). The growth in IoT devices is an important catalyst in driving digital transformation across industries.\n\nConsumer. Consumer IoT products continue to adopt the latest mobile connectivity, processing and intelligence technologies, including personal computing (e.g., tablets and personal computers), connected audio (e.g., wireless earbuds, speakers and soundbars), wearables (e.g., smart watches), XR devices (e.g., VR headsets and AR glasses) and others (e.g., camera and video collaboration, exercise equipment and home appliances). This is enabling new services, applications and experiences.\n\nEdge Networking. Growth in demand for connected devices, the transition to hybrid work environments and advances in wireless technology are driving increased demand for edge networking products (including mobile broadband and wireless access points). 5G provides the flexibility to support both mobile and fixed wireless users with the delivery of high-speed, low-latency connections, enabling operators to replace traditional 'last-mile' wired broadband connections. Additionally, advancements in WiFi are driving consumer and enterprise demand for the latest Wi-Fi 6 and 6E access point technologies that leverage increased network speed, capacity and efficiency to support the increased number of connected devices at home and at work.\n\nIndustrial. The combination of IoT devices with connectivity, computing and on-device AI along with the cloud are helping to bring near real-time data and insights in industries such as retail, transportation, logistics, mining and energy. This allows companies to gain new knowledge and insights about their products and services, manufacturing processes and more, which should help to transform, optimize and innovate their business.\n\n## Technology Overview\n\nThe worldwide demand for wireless devices, data services and applications requires continuous innovation to improve the user experiences, support new services, increase network capacity, make use of different frequency bands and allow for dense network deployments. To meet these requirements, different wireless communications technologies continue to evolve. We have a long history of investing heavily in research and development and have developed foundational technologies, including CDMA and OFDMA, that help drive the continued evolution of the wireless industry. As a result, we have developed and acquired (and continue to develop and acquire) significant related intellectual property. This intellectual property has been incorporated into the most widely accepted and deployed cellular wireless communications technology standards, and we have licensed it to several hundred licensees, including all of the leading handset manufacturers.\n\nCellular Wireless Technologies. Relevant cellular wireless technologies can be grouped into the following categories.\n\nCDMA-based. CDMA-based technologies are characterized by their access method allowing several users to share the same frequency and time by allocating different orthogonal codes to individual users. Most of the CDMA-based technologies are classified as 3G technology and provide vastly improved capacity for voice and low-rate data services as compared to analog technologies and significant improvements over earlier technologies (e.g., 2G technology). CDMA-based connections worldwide continue to decline as consumers migrate to OFDMA-based technologies, which comprise the majority of total cellular connections today.",

Our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications, and related technologies and products, as well as in our existing technologies and products, and new technologies, may not generate operating income or contribute to future results of operations that meet our expectations.\n\nWhile we continue to invest significant resources toward advancements primarily in support 5G-based technologies, we also invest in new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, by utilizing our existing technical and business expertise and through acquisitions or other strategic transactions.\n\nIn particular, our future growth depends in part on new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, such as automotive and IoT; our ability to develop leading and cost-effective technologies and products for these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications; and third parties incorporating our technologies and products into devices used in these product areas, industries and applications. Accordingly, we intend to continue to make substantial investments in these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications, and in developing new products and technologies for these product areas, industries and applications. Our growth also depends significantly on our ability to develop and patent 5G technologies, and to develop and commercialize products using 5G technologies.\n\nHowever, our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications, and corresponding technologies and products, as well as in our existing technologies and products and new technologies in mobile handsets, may not succeed because, among other reasons: we may not be issued patents on the technologies we develop; the technologies we develop may not be incorporated into relevant standards; new and expanded product areas, industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, and consumer demand therein, may not develop or grow as anticipated; we may be unable to attract or retain employees with the necessary skills in such new and expanded product areas, industries and applications; our strategies or the strategies of our customers, licensees or partners may not be successful; alternate technologies or products may be better or may reduce the advantages we anticipate from our investments; competitors' technologies or products may be more cost effective, have more capabilities or fewer limitations or be brought to market faster than our new technologies or products; we may not be able to develop, or our competitors may have more established and/or stronger, customer, vendor, distributor or other channel relationships; and competitors may have longer operating histories in industries and applications that are new to us. We may also underestimate the costs of, or overestimate the future revenues or margins that could result from these investments, and these investments may not, or may take many years to, generate material returns.\n\nFurther, the automotive industry is subject to long design-in time frames, long product life cycles and a high degree of regulatory and safety requirements, necessitating suppliers to the industry to comply with stringent qualification processes, very low defect rates and high reliability standards, all of which results in significant barriers to entry and increased costs.\n\nIf our products fail to perform to specifications, compete with the product quality of our competitors or meet quality and/or regulatory standards of a particular industry or application (including product safety and information security standards, which may differ by region, geography and industry, and which are particularly stringent in the automotive industry), we may be unable to successfully expand our business in that industry or application, and our growth could be limited.\n\nIn addition, in order to successfully extend our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, we may need to transition to new business models and transform aspects of our organization, and we may not be successful in doing so.",

          "chunk_text": "entire wireless system (including wireless devices and network infrastructure equipment), not just the portion of such patented technologies incorporated into chipsets. Over the years, a number of companies have challenged our patent position, but the mobile communications industry generally recognizes that any company seeking to develop, manufacture and/or sell certain wireless products that use CDMA-based and/or OFDMA-based technologies requires a license or other rights to use our patents.\n\nWe have licensed or otherwise provided rights to use our patents to hundreds of companies on industry-accepted terms. Our strategy to make our patented technologies broadly available has been a catalyst for industry growth, helping to enable a wide range of companies offering a broad array of wireless products and features while increasing the capabilities of and/or driving down average and low-end selling prices for handsets and other wireless devices. By licensing or otherwise providing rights to use our patents to a wide range of equipment manufacturers, encouraging innovative applications, supporting equipment manufacturers with integrated chipset and software products and focusing on improving the efficiency of the airlink for wireless operators, we have helped multimode device capabilities evolve, grow demand and reduce device pricing. 5G network deployments and commercial 3G/4G/5G multimode device sales began in 2019 and have continued. By licensing or otherwise providing rights to use our patents to a wide range of equipment manufacturers, we are supporting the global rollout and availability of 5G technology. We believe that 5G will continue to encourage innovative applications through enhanced mobile broadband services with lower latency and multi-gigabit user data speeds and bring more capacity and efficiency to wireless networks.\n\nUpon the initial deployment of OFDMA-based networks, the products implementing such technologies generally have been multimode and implement OFDMA-based and CDMA-based technologies. The licenses granted under our existing license agreements generally cover multimode CDMA/OFDMA (3G/4G/5G) devices, and our licensees are obligated to pay royalties under their license agreements for their sales of such devices.\n\nStandards bodies have been informed that we hold patents that might be essential for all 3G standards that are based on CDMA, patents and pending patent applications that are potentially essential for LTE standards, including FDD and TDD versions, and patents and pending patent applications that are potentially essential for 5G technologies. We have committed to such standards bodies that we will offer to license our essential patents for these standards consistent with our commitments to those bodies. We have made similar commitments with respect to certain other technologies implemented in industry standards.\n\nQTL licensing revenues include royalties and, to a lesser extent, license fees. Licensees pay quarterly royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property and may also pay a fixed license fee in one or more installments. Sales-based royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale (i.e., licensee's) selling price of complete licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (including transportation, insurance, packing costs and other items). We broadly provide per unit royalty caps that apply to certain categories of complete wireless devices, such as smartphones, tablets, laptops and smartwatches, and which provide for a maximum royalty amount payable per device. For certain non-handset product categories, including automotive, we charge a fixed royalty amount per unit. Revenues generated from royalties are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations.\n\nThe vast majority of QTL revenues have been generated through our licensees' sales of CDMA-based (including, but not limited to WCDMA-based) and OFDMA-based products (including 3G, 3G/4G and 3G/4G/5G multimode devices), such as smartphones and other devices. We have invested in both the acquisition and development of, and continue to invest in the development of, OFDMA technology and intellectual property and have generated the industry leading patent portfolio applicable to LTE, LTE Advanced, LTE Advanced Pro and 5G NR. Some of our inventions that serve as foundational technologies for 3G and 4G also serve as foundational technologies for 5G. We have invested and continue to invest in the development of 5G and continue to play a significant role in driving advancements of 5G. Nevertheless, we face competition in the development of intellectual property for future generations of digital wireless communications technologies and services.\n\nSeparate and apart from licensing manufacturers of wireless devices and network equipment, we have entered into certain arrangements with competitors of our QCT segment. A principal purpose of these arrangements is to provide our QCT segment and the counterparties certain freedom of operation with respect to each party's integrated circuits business. In every case, these agreements expressly reserve the right for QTL to seek royalties from the customers of such integrated circuit suppliers with respect to such suppliers' customers' sales of CDMA-based (including, but not limited to WCDMA-based) and OFDMA-based wireless devices into which such suppliers' integrated circuits are incorporated.\n\nOur license agreements also may provide us with rights to use certain of our licensees' technology and intellectual property to manufacture, sell and/or use certain components (e.g., application-specific integrated circuits) and related software, cellular devices and/or infrastructure equipment.\n\nWe have been in the past, currently are, and may in the future be subject to certain legal proceedings and/or governmental investigations challenging our patent licensing practices, including those described in this Annual Report under the heading 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies,' which may require us to change our patent licensing practices as described herein in 'Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors' under the heading ' Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations.

      "answer": "Oracle Middleware and Java provide foundational technologies that enable seamless application development and deployment across different environments, including the Oracle Cloud. Specifically, Oracle Middleware simplifies integration of Oracle and non-Oracle applications, automates business processes, and supports global deployment across cloud and on-premise environments. Java, being the world's most popular programming language, allows developers to write software once and deploy it across multiple platforms, independent of operating system and hardware architecture. This cross-platform capability directly supports Oracle's strategy to attract both independent software vendors (ISVs) and enterprise customers to deploy applications on the Oracle Cloud. Additionally, Oracle Exadata Database Machine, as part of Oracle Engineered Systems, is optimized for high performance, scalability, and availability when used with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). This integration enables efficient and non-disruptive migration and operation of large-scale applications and databases to the cloud, reinforcing Oracle's broader cloud migration strategy.",

      "question": "How does Oracle's reliance on third-party colocation suppliers for global data centers impact the financial risk associated with Oracle Cloud Services, especially considering the long-term lease commitments and potential contract termination fees?",
      "answer": "Oracle delivers Oracle Cloud Services through global data centers, substantially all of which are leased through third-party colocation suppliers. Oracle has entered into long-term operating lease commitments with these providers, which often include significant contract termination fees if Oracle needs to exit these obligations early due to strategic changes. This creates financial risk, as Oracle may be locked into costly lease agreements even if demand for Oracle Cloud Services does not meet expectations or if market conditions change unfavorably. Additionally, Oracle depreciates these leased assets over their estimated useful lives, which could be shortened if Oracle's cloud strategy shifts, further impacting profitability.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Oracle delivers Oracle Cloud Services through global data centers, substantially all of which were leased through colocation suppliers.",

      "question": "How does Oracle's integration of Autonomous Database with OCI enable both cost reduction for customers and strategic growth in its cloud and license business?",
      "answer": "Oracle's integration of Autonomous Database with OCI enables cost reduction for customers by automating routine database administration tasks such as maintenance, tuning, patching, scaling, security, and backup, while also using machine learning-driven diagnostics to reduce human error and operational costs. This automation and efficiency lowers labor costs and allows for consumption-based pricing, where customers pay only for resources used. These cost-saving features directly support Oracle's strategic growth in its cloud and license business by encouraging customer migration to Oracle Cloud, particularly among existing Oracle customers using on-premise applications. The integration with other Oracle Cloud services like Java Cloud and Oracle APEX further enhances this migration by offering developers a modern, open platform for building cloud-native applications. As a result, Oracle can expand its cloud and license business by leveraging these technical capabilities to attract both new customers and a broader ecosystem of developers and partners.",

      "answer": "Oracle relies on third-party manufacturing partners to produce most of its hardware products used in Oracle Cloud Services, and while many components have alternative suppliers, certain hardware components come from sole sources, creating potential supply chain disruption risks. Additionally, Oracle acknowledges that coding, manufacturing, or configuration errors in its cloud and hardware offerings can lead to service interruptions, security vulnerabilities, and delays in product releases. These issues can harm market acceptance and result in declining sales and revenues. Therefore, a disruption in hardware supply or a significant product error could delay Oracle Cloud Services deployment, increase costs, and reduce profitability, especially as Oracle continues to invest in expanding the Oracle Cloud to meet customer demand.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Oracle relies on third-party manufacturing partners for hardware products used in Oracle Cloud Services and has sole-source dependencies for certain components, which could lead to supply chain disruptions.",

We focus our development efforts on improving the performance, security, reliability, operation, integration and cost-effectiveness of our offerings relative to our competitors; facilitating the ease with which organizations are able to deploy, use, manage and maintain our offerings; and i ncorporating emerging technologies such as AI within our offerings to enable leaner business processes, automation and innovation. For example, our Oracle Autonomous Database is designed to deliver transformational infrastructure as an OCI offering that uses machine learning capabilities to automate many traditionally manual functions.\n\nAfter an initial purchase of Oracle products and services, our customers can continue to benefit from our offerings, research and development efforts and deep IT expertise by electing to purchase and renew Oracle support offerings for their license and hardware deployments, which may include product enhancements that we periodically deliver to our products, and by renewing their Oracle Cloud Services contracts with us.\n\nOur selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. We believe that our acquisitions enhance the products and services that we can offer to customers, expand our customer base, provide greater scale to accelerate innovation, grow our revenues and earnings and i ncrease stockholder value. We have invested billions of dollars over time to acquire a number of companies, products, services and technologies that add to, are complementary to, or have otherwise enhanced our existing offerings. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies to further our corporate strategy.\n\nWe have three businesses: cloud and license; hardware; and services. Each business is comprised of a single operating segment.

Oracle technologies are based upon industry standards and are designed to be enterprise-grade, reliable, scalable and secure. Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies, including database and middleware software as well as enterprise applications, virtualization, clustering, large-scale systems management and related infrastructure products and services, are the building blocks of Oracle Cloud Services, our partners' cloud services and our customers' cloud IT environments. Oracle applications and infrastructure offerings are marketed and sold through our cloud and license and hardware businesses, and are delivered through the Oracle Cloud or through other IT deployment models, including cloud-based, hybrid and on-premise deployments.\n\nWe believe that our Oracle Cloud Services offerings are opportunities for us to continue to expand our cloud and license business. We believe that our customers increasingly recognize the value of access to the latest versions of Oracle cloud-based applications and infrastructure capabilities via a lower cost, rapidly deployable, flexible and interoperable services model that Oracle provisions, manages, upgrades and maintains on our customers' behalf. We believe that we can market and sell our Oracle Cloud Services offerings together to help new and existing customers migrate their extensive installed base of on-premise and cloud-based applications and infrastructure technologies to the Oracle Cloud and we believe we are in the early stages of what we expect will be a material migration of our existing Oracle customer base from on-premise applications and infrastructure products and services to the Oracle Cloud. In addition, we also believe we can market our Oracle Cloud Services offerings to a broader ecosystem of small and medium-sized businesses, non-IT lines of business purchasers, developers and partners due to the highly available, intuitive design, ease of access, low touch and low cost characteristics of the Oracle Cloud.\n\nIn recent periods, customer demand for our applications and infrastructure technologies delivered through our Oracle Cloud deployment models has increased.

The noncontrolling interests in our net income were not significant to our consolidated results for the periods presented and therefore have not been presented separately and instead are included as a component of non-operating expenses, net in our consolidated statements of operations.

These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.

Business\n\nOracle provides products and services that address enterprise information technology (IT) needs. Our products and services include enterprise applications and infrastructure offerings that are delivered worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models. These models include onpremise, cloud-based and hybrid deployments (an approach that combines both on-premise and cloud-based deployments), such as Oracle Exadata Cloud@Customer and Dedicated Region offerings (instances of Oracle Cloud in a customer's own data center) and multicloud options that enable customers to use Oracle Cloud in conjunction with other public clouds. Accordingly, we offer choice and flexibility to our customers and facilitate the product, service and deployment combinations that best suit our customers' needs. Our customers include businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers that we market and sell to directly through our worldwide sales force or indirectly through the Oracle Partner Network. Using Oracle technologies, our customers build, deploy, run, manage and support their internal and external products, services and business operations, including, for example, an artificial intelligence (AI) product company that uses Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to build and serve generative AI models; a global technology company that uses OCI to power its logistics and mobile application offerings; a multinational financial institution that runs its banking applications using Oracle Exadata Cloud@Customer; and a global consumer products company that leverages Oracle Fusion Cloud Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) for its accounting processes, risk management, supply chain and financial planning functions.\n\nOracle SaaS and OCI (collectively Oracle Cloud Services) offerings provide comprehensive and integrated applications and infrastructure services enabling our customers to choose the best option that meets their specific business needs. Oracle Cloud Services integrate the IT components, including software, hardware and services, in a cloud-based IT environment that Oracle deploys, manages, supports and upgrades for customers and that customers may access utilizing common web browsers via a broad spectrum of devices.\n\nOracle Cloud Services are designed to be rapidly deployable to enable customers shorter time to innovation; intuitive for casual and experienced users; easily maintainable to reduce upgrade, integration and testing work; connectable among differing deployment models to enable interoperability and extensibility to easily move workloads among the Oracle Cloud and other IT and cloud environments; cost-effective by lowering upfront customer investments and i mplementing usage-based resource consumption costs; and highly secure, standards-based and reliable.\n\nOracle cloud license and on-premise license deployment offerings include Oracle Applications, Oracle Database and Oracle Middleware software offerings, among others, which customers deploy using IT infrastructure from the Oracle Cloud or their own cloud-based or on-premise IT environments. Substantially all customers opt to purchase license support contracts when they purchase an Oracle license.\n\nOracle hardware products include Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage and industry-specific products, among others. Customers generally opt to purchase hardware support contracts when they purchase Oracle hardware products.\n\nOracle also offers professional services to assist our customers and partners to maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle products and services.\n\nProviding choice and flexibility to Oracle customers as to when and how they deploy Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies is an important element of our corporate strategy. We believe that offering customers broad, comprehensive, flexible and interoperable deployment models for Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies is important to our growth strategy and better addresses customer needs relative to our competitors, many of whom provide fewer offerings, more restrictive deployment models and less flexibility for a customer's transition to cloud-based IT environments.\n\nOur investments in, and innovation with respect to, Oracle products and services that we offer through our three businesses (cloud and license, hardware and services businesses, described further below) are another important element of our corporate strategy. In fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, we invested $8.9 billion, $8.6 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively, in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of offerings and to develop new technologies and services.

This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting estimates that we believe are important to understanding significant assumptions and j udgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition for fi s cal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fi s cal year ended May 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on June 20, 2023, which is available free of charge on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and on our Investor Relations website at www.oracle.com/investor.\n\n## Business Overview\n\nOracle provides products and services that address enterprise IT needs. Our products and services include enterprise applications and infrastructure offerings that are delivered worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models. These models include on-premise, cloud-based and hybrid deployments (an approach that combines both on-premise and cloud-based deployments). Accordingly, we offer choice and flexibility to our customers and facilitate the product, service and deployment combinations that best suit our customers' needs. Through our worldwide sales force and Oracle Partner Network, we sell to customers all over the world including businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers.\n\nWe have three businesses: cloud and license; hardware; and services; each of which comprises a single operating segment. The descriptions set forth below as a part of this Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the information contained within Item 1 Business and Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provide additional information related to our businesses and operating segments and align to how our chief operating decision makers (CODMs), which are our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer, view our operating results and allocate resources.\n\n## Cloud and License Business\n\nOur cloud and license business, which represented 84% and 83% of our total revenues in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively, markets, sells and delivers a broad spectrum of enterprise applications and infrastructure technologies through our cloud and license offerings. Revenue streams included in our cloud and license business are:\n\n\u00b7 Cloud services and license support revenues, which include:\n\no cloud services revenues, which are earned by providing customers access to Oracle Cloud applications and infrastructure technologies via cloudbased deployment models that Oracle develops, provides unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploys, hosts, manages and supports and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period. Oracle Cloud Services arrangements generally: are billed in advance of the cloud services being delivered; have durations of one to four years; are renewed at the customer's option; and are recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period of the cloud contract or, in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed over ti me; and o l i cense support revenues, which are earned by providing Oracle license support services to customers that have elected to purchase support services in connection with the purchase of Oracle applications and infrastructure software licenses for use in cloud, on-premise and other IT environments. Substantially all license support customers renew their support contracts with us upon expiration in order to continue to benefit from technical support services and the periodic issuance of unspecified updates and enhancements, which current license support customers are entitled to receive. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase a cloud license and/or onpremise license; are generally billed in advance of the support services being performed; are generally renewed at the customer's option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period that the support services are provided, which is generally one year.",

We deliver our products and services to customers worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models. These models include on-premise, cloud-based and hybrid deployments (an approach that combines both on-premise and cloud based deployments). Oracle Cloud Software-as-a-Service and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (SaaS and OCI, respectively, and collectively, Oracle Cloud Services) offerings provide comprehensive and integrated applications and infrastructure services enabling our customers to choose the best option that meets their specific business needs. Customers may also elect to purchase Oracle software licenses and hardware products and related services to manage their own cloud-based or on-premise IT environments. Customers that purchase our software licenses may elect to purchase license support contracts, which provide our customers with rights to unspecified license upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period as well as technical support assistance. Customers that purchase our hardware products may elect to purchase hardware support contracts, which provide customers with software updates and can include product repairs, maintenance services, and technical support services. We also offer customers a broad set of services offerings that are designed to improve customer utilization of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies.\n\nOracle Corporation conducts business globally and was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977.\n\n## Basis of Financial Statements\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interest positions of certain of our consolidated entities are reported as a separate component of consolidated equity from the equity attributable to Oracle's stockholders for all periods presented. The noncontrolling interests in our net income were not significant to our consolidated results for the periods presented and therefore have not been presented separately and instead are included as a component of non-operating expenses, net in our consolidated statements of operations. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The comparability of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended May 31, 2022 was impacted by $4.7 billion of certain litigation related charges during fiscal 2022.\n\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we finalized our adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting and subsequent amendments to the initial guidance, which had no material impact to our consolidated financial statements or notes thereto for the year ended May 31, 2024.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), and we consider various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the SEC. These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically",

      "answer": "The total financial value of AMD's relationship with the ATMP JV in 2021 was $1.106 billion, combining $1.1 billion in purchases and a $6 million equity gain. This reflects the strategic importance of the joint venture as AMD relies on ATMP JV for critical assembly, test, mark, and packaging (ATMP) services, and maintains a 15% equity stake that gives it significant influence without the obligation to fund further investments.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Adding the $1.1 billion in purchases and the $6 million equity gain gives the total financial value of AMD's relationship with the ATMP JV in 2021, which underscores the strategic nature of the joint venture in supporting AMD's supply chain operations."

We also rely on our AIB partners to support our GPU and APU products. In addition, our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with Intel microprocessors. If the designers, manufacturers, AIBs and suppliers of motherboards, graphics cards, software, memory and other components cease or reduce their design, manufacture or production of current or future products that are based on or support our products, our business could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## If  we  lose  Microsoft  Corporation's  support  for  our  products  or  other  software  vendors  do  not  design  and develop software to run on our products, our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends partially on Microsoft designing and developing  its  operating  systems  to  run  on  or  support  our  x86-based  microprocessor  products.  With  respect  to  our graphics products, we depend in part on Microsoft to design and develop its operating system to run on or support our graphics products. Similarly, the success of our products in the market, such as our APU products, is dependent on independent  software  providers  designing  and  developing  software  to  run  on  our  products.  If  Microsoft  does  not continue  to  design  and  develop  its  operating  systems  so  that  they  work  with  our  x86  instruction  sets  or  does  not continue  to  develop  and  maintain  their  operating  systems  to  support  our  graphics  products,  independent  software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our products. In addition, some software drivers licensed for use with our products are certified by  Microsoft.  If  Microsoft  did  not  certify  a  driver,  or  if  we  otherwise  fail  to  retain  the  support  of  Microsoft  or  other software vendors, our ability to market our products would be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Our reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects us to certain risks.\n\nWe market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors and AIB partners pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party. These agreements are  non-exclusive  and  permit  both  our  distributors  and  AIB  partners  to  offer  our  competitors'  products.  We  are dependent on our distributors and AIB partners to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. If any significant distributor or AIB partner or a substantial number of our distributors or AIB partners terminated their relationship with us, decided to market our competitors' products over our products or decided not to market our products at all, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable  to  collect  accounts  receivable  from  our  significant  distributors  and/or AIB  partners,  it  could  have  a  material adverse effect on our business. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the use of our third-party distributors and AIB  partners  or  offer  appropriate  incentives  to  focus  them  on  the  sale  of  our  products,  our  business  could  be materially adversely affected.\n\nAdditionally,  distributors  and  AIB  partners  typically  maintain  an  inventory  of  our  products.

Some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Our agreements with AIB partners protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. In the event of a significant decline in the price of our products, the price protection rights we offer would materially adversely affect us because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline.\n\n## Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls.\n\nWe rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions, and the  efficient  operation  of  these  processes  and  systems  is  critical  to  our  business.

          "chunk_text": "## Our Graphics Products\n\nGraphics processing is a fundamental component across many of our products and can be found in an APU, GPU, SoC or  a  combination  of  a  discrete  GPU  with  one  of  the  other  foregoing  products  working  in  tandem.  Our  customers generally  use  our  graphics  solutions  to  enable  or  increase  the  speed  of  rendering  images,  to  help  improve  image resolution and color definition, and increasingly to process massive data sets for cloud and data center applications. We develop our graphics products for use in various computing devices and entertainment platforms, including desktop PCs,  notebook  PCs, All-in-Ones  (AIOs),  professional  workstations,  and  the  data  center.  With  each  of  our  graphics products, we have available drivers and supporting software packages that enable the effective use of these products under a variety of operating systems and applications. We have developed RDNA\u2122 2, a high performing and power efficient graphics architecture, which is the foundation for next-generation PC gaming graphics, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S and X consoles. Additionally, our RDNA 2 architecture supports advanced graphics features such as ray tracing, Infinity Cache and variable rate shading. Our hardware and software components are used to implement ray tracing technology to simulate the paths of light rays moving through a movie or game scene, resulting in photorealistic 3D images.\n\nOur APUs deliver visual processing functionality for value and mainstream PCs by integrating a CPU and a GPU on a single chip, while discrete GPUs (which are also known as dGPUs) offer high-performance graphics processing across all  platforms. AMD Accelerated Parallel Processing or General Purpose GPU (GPGPU) refers to a set of advanced hardware and software technologies that enable discrete AMD GPUs, working in concert with the CPU, to accelerate computational tasks beyond traditional CPU processing by utilizing the vast number of GPU cores while working with the CPU to process information cooperatively.

We are also monitoring our operations and public health measures implemented by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic.\n\nCOVID-19 also continues to impact the global supply chain, causing disruptions to service providers, logistics and the flow and availability of supplies and products. Despite these challenges, we took action to maintain a stable supply of materials  to  meet  our  production  requirements  and  delivered  incremental  supply  throughout  the  year.  We  also experienced  strong  customer  demand  in  2021  and  made  strategic  investments  through  long-term  purchase commitments  and  prepayment  arrangements  in  our  supply  chain  to  secure  additional  capacity  to  support  future revenue growth. For example, we amended our Wafer Supply Agreement (WSA) with GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF) in May 2021 (the A&amp;R Seventh Amendment) and in December 2021 (the Amendment) to modify certain terms of the WSA applicable to wafer purchases at the 12 nm and 14 nm technology nodes from December 23, 2021 and continuing through December 31, 2025. Under the Amendment, GF will provide a minimum annual capacity allocation to us for years 2022 through 2025 and we have corresponding annual wafer targets. We also agreed to wafer pricing through 2025, and we are obligated to pre-pay GF certain amounts for those wafers in 2022 and 2023. The Amendment does not affect any of the prior exclusivity commitments that were removed under the A&amp;R Seventh Amendment. We have full flexibility to contract with any wafer foundry with respect to all products manufactured at any technology node.\n\nDue to our strong financial results and growing cash flow generation, in May 2021, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program (Repurchase Program) to purchase up to $4 billion of our outstanding common stock in the open market. During the twelve months ended December 25, 2021, we repurchased 16.7 million shares of our common stock  under  the  Repurchase  Program,  for  a  total  cash  outlay  of  $1.8  billion. As  of  December  25,  2021,  $2.2  billion remained available for future stock repurchases under this program. The Repurchase Program does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\n\nAs  part  of  our  strategy  to  establish  AMD  as  the  industry's  high  performance  computing  leader,  we  announced  in October  2020  that  we  entered  into  a  definitive  agreement  to  acquire  Xilinx,  Inc.  in  an  all-stock  transaction.  The completion  of  the  transaction  remains  subject  to  certain  closing  conditions,  including  regulatory  approval,  and  is currently expected to close in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nWe intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nOur  discussion  and  analysis  of  our  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  are  based  upon  our  consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP).  The  preparation  of  our  financial  statements  requires  us  to  make  estimates  and  judgments  that  affect  the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenue, inventories, goodwill and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the  basis  for  making  judgments  about  the  carrying  values  of  assets  and  liabilities.  Although  actual  results  have historically  been  reasonably  consistent  with  management's  expectations,  the  actual  results  may  differ  from  these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions.\n\nManagement believes the following  critical  accounting  estimates  are  the  most  significant  to  the  presentation  of  our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.\n\nRevenue Allowances. Revenue contracts with our customers include variable amounts which we evaluate under ASC 606-10-32-8 through 14 in order to determine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled and which we recognize as revenue. We determine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer after adjustments to the contract price for rights of return and rebates to our OEM customers and rights of return, rebates and price protection on unsold merchandise to our distributor customers.\n\nWe base our determination of necessary adjustments to the contract price by reference to actual historical activity and experience, including actual historical returns, rebates and credits issued to OEM and distributor customers adjusted, as applicable, to include adjustments, if any, for known events or current economic conditions, or both.",

      "answer": "The primary drivers of Apple's Wearables, Home and Accessories segment growth in 2022 were the Apple Watch and AirPods. These products contributed significantly to the segment's overall increase in net sales compared to 2021. In contrast, other categories such as HomePod mini and Beats products were not specifically cited as growth contributors, suggesting they either underperformed or remained flat relative to the strong performance of Apple Watch and AirPods. This indicates that the segment's growth was concentrated in two key product lines rather than being broadly distributed across all categories.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - 'Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to higher net sales of Apple Watch and AirPods.' This identifies the key growth drivers within the segment.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - 'Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, HomePod mini and accessories.' This provides the full list of product categories within the segment, establishing a comparative baseline.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Since only Apple Watch and AirPods are explicitly cited as growth contributors, it follows that the other listed products (Apple TV, Beats products, HomePod mini) did not materially contribute to the segment's growth, implying a concentration of performance in the two named products."

      "answer": "IBM's 2001 Long-Term Performance Plan provides a standardized framework for equity compensation that is applied consistently across acquisitions, ensuring continuity for non-senior executives. The plan allows for the assumption of equity awards from acquired entities, as seen in the case of 16 acquisitions where 635,297 additional share-based awards were outstanding at December 31, 2021, with a weighted-average exercise price of $25.92. The 2001 Plan is substantively identical to the PWCC Plan and the Red Hat Plan, both of which were adopted specifically for employees from those acquisitions. This uniformity ensures that employees from acquired companies receive comparable equity compensation terms, such as stock options, restricted stock, and performance share units, without deviation from the core structure of the 2001 Plan. Furthermore, the plan is administered by the Executive Compensation and Management Resources Committee, which can delegate authority and approve deferred payments, ensuring flexibility while maintaining centralized oversight. This structured yet adaptable approach supports seamless integration of equity compensation practices post-acquisition.",

Payment of awards may be made in the form of cash, stock or combinations thereof and may be deferred with Committee approval. Awards are not transferable or assignable except (i) by law, will or the laws of descent and distribution, (ii) as a result of the disability of the recipient, or (iii) with the approval of the Committee.\n\nIf the employment of a participant terminates, other than as a result of the death or disability of a participant, all unexercised, deferred and unpaid awards shall be canceled immediately, unless the award agreement provides otherwise. In the event of the death of a participant or in the event a participant is deemed by the company to be disabled and eligible for benefits under the terms of the IBM Long-Term Disability Plan (or any successor plan or similar plan of another employer), the participant's estate, beneficiaries or representative, as the case may be, shall have the rights and duties of the participant under the applicable award agreement. In addition, unless the award agreement specifies otherwise, the Committee may cancel, rescind, suspend, withhold or otherwise limit or restrict any unexpired, unpaid, or deferred award at any time if the participant is not in compliance with all applicable provisions of the awards agreement and the 2001 Plan. In addition, awards may be cancelled if the participant engages in any conduct or act determined to be injurious, detrimental or prejudicial to any interest of the company.\n\n## PWCC Acquisition Long-Term Performance Plan (the 'PWCC Plan')\n\nThe PWCC Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in connection with the company's acquisition of PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting (''PwCC'') from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, as announced on October 1, 2002. The PWCC Plan has been and will continue to be used solely to fund awards for employees of PwCC who have become employed by the company as a result of the acquisition. Awards for senior executives of the company will not be funded from the PWCC Plan. The terms and conditions of the PWCC Plan are substantively identical to the terms and conditions of the 2001 Plan, described above.\n\n## IBM Red Hat Acquisition Long-Term Performance Plan (the 'Red Hat Plan')\n\nThe Red Hat Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in connection with the company's acquisition of Red Hat, Inc. on July 9, 2019. The Red Hat Plan has been and will continue to be used solely to fund awards for employees who were not employed by IBM immediately prior to the closing of the acquisition. Awards for senior executives of the company will not be funded from the Red Hat Plan. The terms and conditions of the Red Hat Plan are substantively identical to the terms and conditions of the 2001 Plan, described above.\n\n## Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation and Equity Award Plan (the 'DCEAP')\n\nThe DCEAP was adopted in 1993 and amended and restated effective January 1, 2014. Under the Amended and Restated DCEAP, non-management directors receive Promised Fee Shares in connection with deferred annual retainer payments. Each Promised Fee Share is equal in value to one share of the company's common stock. Upon a director's retirement or other completion of service as a director, amounts deferred into Promised Fee Shares are payable in either cash and/or shares of the company's stock either as lump sum or installments pursuant to the director's distribution election.

      "answer": "Cisco's guarantee of channel partner financing arrangements increases its credit loss exposure because it could be required to make payments if channel partners default on short-term financing with third parties. According to the filing, Cisco facilitates revolving short-term financing for channel partners with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days and, in some cases, guarantees a portion of these arrangements. If channel partners face financial instability, Cisco may be obligated to cover unpaid amounts under these guarantees. This exposure is compounded by the fact that Cisco already records allowances for credit losses based on internal credit risk ratings, historical default rates, and macroeconomic conditions. If financial instability among channel partners rises, Cisco could experience higher credit losses tied to these financing guarantees, directly impacting its financial position.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Cisco faces risks related to channel partner financial problems, which could affect its business, results of operations, and financial condition.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Cisco facilitates short-term financing for channel partners and guarantees a portion of these arrangements, potentially requiring Cisco to make payments in the event of channel partner nonpayment.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Cisco's financial exposure from channel partner instability is heightened by its guarantees on financing arrangements, increasing the risk of credit losses that must be accounted for in its allowance for credit losses."

Given that Services revenue increased from $85.2 billion in 2023 to $96.169 billion in 2024, and total net sales rose from $383.285 billion in 2023 to $391.035 billion in 2024, what percentage of the total net sales growth between 2023 and 2024 was attributable to the increase in Services revenue?",
      "answer": "The increase in Services revenue contributed approximately 121% of the total net sales growth between 2023 and 2024. This is calculated as follows: Services revenue increased by $10.969 billion ($96.169B - $85.2B), while total net sales increased by $7.75 billion ($391.035B - $383.285B). Therefore, the Services growth alone accounted for $10.969B / $7.75B = 121% of the total net sales growth.",

      "question": "Given Apple's reliance on third-party developers and digital content providers for its product ecosystem, and considering the 12.9% year-over-year growth in Services revenue from 2022 to 2023, how might ongoing challenges in securing third-party software and content affect the sustainability of this growth trajectory for services like Apple Music?",
      "answer": "Apple's Services revenue grew from $78,129 million in 2022 to $85,200 million in 2023, representing a 12.9% increase. This growth includes revenue from services like Apple Music. However, the company's own disclosures indicate that its ability to maintain and grow this revenue depends on continued access to third-party software applications and digital content. Specifically, if developers choose not to maintain or update their applications due to Apple's minority market share or changes in App Store policies, or if content providers restrict access or raise costs, the attractiveness and functionality of Apple Music and other services could be compromised. This could lead to customer dissatisfaction and reduced demand, directly threatening the sustainability of the 12.9% growth rate seen in Services revenue.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_b, extract the Services revenue figures: $78,129 million in 2022 and $85,200 million in 2023, showing a 12.9% year-over-year increase.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_a, extract Apple's stated dependency on third-party developers and content providers for the success of its products and services, including potential risks if these relationships falter.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The 12.9% growth in Services revenue (which includes Apple Music) could be unsustainable if Apple fails to maintain third-party support, as the company itself acknowledges that customer demand for its products and services is partially dependent on the availability and quality of third-party applications and digital content."

      "answer": "The strategic purchase of the 300-millimeter semiconductor factory in Lehi, Utah, in 2021 represents a significant investment in TXN's manufacturing capabilities. However, this facility is listed among TXN's global operations that are vulnerable to natural disasters, such as severe weather or geological events. Since TXN operates in multiple locations\u2014including Lehi, Utah\u2014its results of operations could be adversely affected if a natural disaster were to disrupt operations at this site. This risk is compounded by the fact that TXN relies on a global supply chain and manufacturing network, and any prolonged disruption could hinder its ability to realize the expected benefits from the Lehi factory investment.",

          "chunk_text": "## Our ability to successfully implement strategic, business and organizational changes could affect our business plans and results of operations.\n\nFrom time to time, we undertake strategic, business and organizational changes, including acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring actions, to support or carry out our objectives. For example, the purchase of our 300-millimeter semiconductor factory in Lehi, Utah in 2021. If we do not successfully implement these changes, our business plans and operating results could be adversely affected. We may not achieve or sustain the expected growth, cost savings or other benefits of strategic, business and organizational changes, and charges associated with these actions could differ materially in amount and timing from our expectations.\n\n## Our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we operate.\n\nWe have manufacturing, data and design facilities and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather, geological events or epidemics that could disrupt operations. Climate change might exacerbate these occurrences or cause natural disasters to occur with greater frequency. A natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption, particularly where we have principal manufacturing and design operations, as listed in the Properties section in Item 2, may adversely affect our results and financial condition.\n\n## Rapid technological change in markets we serve requires us to develop new technologies and products.\n\nRapid technological change in markets we serve could contribute to shortened product life cycles and a decline in average selling prices of our products. Our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop, manufacture and market innovative products in a timely and cost-effective manner. We make significant investments in research and development to improve existing technology and products, develop new products to meet changing customer demands, and improve our production processes. In some cases, we might not realize a return or the expected return on our investments because they are generally made before commercial viability can be assured. Further, projects that are commercially viable may not contribute to our operating results until at least a few years after they are completed.\n\n## We face supply chain and manufacturing risks.\n\nWe rely on third parties to supply us with goods and services in a cost-effective and timely manner. Our access to needed goods and services may be adversely affected by potential disputes with suppliers or disruptions in our own or suppliers' operations as a result of, for example: quality excursions; uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets; domestic or international political, social, economic and other conditions; natural events or epidemics in the locations in which our suppliers operate; or limited or delayed access to and high costs of key materials, natural resources, services and utilities. Additionally, a breach or other incident relating to our suppliers' information technology systems could result in a release of confidential or proprietary information. If our suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity, we may be unable to obtain needed supplies, collect accounts receivable or access needed technology.\n\nIn particular, our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment, and those of our suppliers, require that certain key materials, natural resources, services and utilities be available. Suppliers of these items have and might continue to extend lead times, limit supply or increase prices due to factors beyond our control. Limited or delayed access to and high costs of key materials, natural resources, services and utilities could adversely affect our results of operations. Our products contain materials that are subject to conflict minerals reporting requirements. Our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to describe our products as conflict-free. Additionally, our costs may increase if one or more of our customers demand that we change the sourcing of materials we cannot identify as conflict-free.\n\nOur inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations. We have made and will continue to make significant investments in manufacturing capacity, and we might not realize our expected return on those investments. We subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our products, and we depend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development. We do not have long-term contracts with all of these suppliers, and the number of alternate suppliers is limited. Reliance on these suppliers involves risks, including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand, suppliers' inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely, cost-effective, and appropriate manner, the possibility of suppliers' imposition of increased costs on us and the unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property.",

Description of business, including segment and geographic area information\n\nWe design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. We have two reportable segments, Analog and Embedded Processing, each of which represents groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels.\n\n- Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by converting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. Our Analog segment consists of two major product lines: Power and Signal Chain.\n- Embedded Processing products are the digital 'brains' of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application.\n\nWe report the results of our remaining business activities in Other. Other includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other includes DLP  products, calculators and custom ASIC products. \u00ae\n\nIn Other, we also include items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. Examples of these items include acquisition, integration and restructuring charges (see Note 11); and certain corporate-level items, such as litigation expenses, environmental costs, insurance settlements, and gains and losses from other activities, including asset dispositions. We allocate the remainder of our expenses associated with corporate activities to our operating segments based on specific methodologies, such as percentage of operating expenses or headcount.\n\nOur centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, provide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments' results and, therefore, is not provided.\n\nWith the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, nor does the chief operating decision maker evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. We have no material intersegment revenue. The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in the summary of significant accounting policies and practices.",

          "chunk_text": "We believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factors, including the breadth of a company's product line, the strength and reach of its channels to market, technological innovation, product development execution, technical support, customer service, quality, reliability, price and manufacturing capacity and capabilities. In addition, manufacturing process and package technologies that provide differentiated levels of performance and a structural cost advantage are competitive factors for our analog products, and customers' prior investments in software development is a competitive factor for our embedded processing products.\n\n## Market cycle\n\nThe 'semiconductor cycle' refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand and the building and depleting of inventories. The semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand and/or insufficient manufacturing capacity, followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand and/or excess manufacturing capacity. These are typically referred to as upturns and downturns in the semiconductor cycle. Semiconductor cycles are affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nOur revenue is subject to some seasonal variation. Historically, our sequential revenue growth rate tends to be weaker in the first and fourth quarters when compared with the second and third quarters.\n\n## Customers, sales and distribution\n\nWe sell our products to over 100,000 customers. Our customer base is diverse, with more than 40% of our revenue derived from customers outside our largest 100.\n\nWe market and sell our products through direct sales channels, including our website and broad sales and applications team, and, to a lesser extent, through distributors. Over the past several years, we have been investing in new capabilities to build closer direct customer relationships. For example, in 2021 about two-thirds of our revenue was direct, and transactions on TI.com grew to about 10% of our revenue, as customers valued the convenience of purchasing online. Closer direct relationships with our customers help to strengthen our reach of market channel advantage and give us access to more customers and more of their design projects, leading to opportunities to sell more of our products into each design. Additionally, broader and deeper access gives us better insight and knowledge of customer needs.\n\nOur investments in new and improved capabilities to directly support our customers include website and e-commerce enhancements as well as inventory consignment programs and order fulfillment services. We expanded the reach of our TI.com e-commerce channel by offering a localized online experience in many countries, with convenience features such as immediate availability, local currency, payment methods, invoicing and importer of record. In addition to doing business directly with TI, we offer customers the option of using a single worldwide distributor and a few region-specific distributors for order fulfillment.\n\n## Manufacturing\n\nSemiconductor manufacturing begins with a sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer. Each device on the wafer is packaged and tested. The entire process takes place in highly specialized facilities that require substantial investments.\n\nWe own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facilities in North America, Asia, Japan and Europe. These include both wafer fabrication and assembly/test facilities.\n\nWe invest in manufacturing technologies and do most of our manufacturing in-house. This strategic decision to make manufacturing and technology a core competitive advantage provides us with tangible benefits of lower manufacturing costs and greater control of our supply chain. We have focused on creating a competitive manufacturing structural cost advantage by investing in our advanced 300-millimeter capacity. An unpackaged chip built on a 300-millimeter wafer costs about 40% less than an unpackaged chip built on a 200-millimeter wafer.",

For example, the purchase of our 300-millimeter semiconductor factory in Lehi, Utah in 2021. If we do not successfully implement these changes, our business plans and operating results could be adversely affected. We may not achieve or sustain the expected growth, cost savings or other benefits of strategic, business and organizational changes, and charges associated with these actions could differ materially in amount and timing from our expectations.\n\n## Our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we operate.\n\nWe have manufacturing, data and design facilities and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather, geological events or epidemics that could disrupt operations. Climate change might exacerbate these occurrences or cause natural disasters to occur with greater frequency. A natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption, particularly where we have principal manufacturing and design operations, as listed in the Properties section in Item 2, may adversely affect our results and financial condition.\n\n## Rapid technological change in markets we serve requires us to develop new technologies and products.\n\nRapid technological change in markets we serve could contribute to shortened product life cycles and a decline in average selling prices of our products. Our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop, manufacture and market innovative products in a timely and cost-effective manner. We make significant investments in research and development to improve existing technology and products, develop new products to meet changing customer demands, and improve our production processes. In some cases, we might not realize a return or the expected return on our investments because they are generally made before commercial viability can be assured. Further, projects that are commercially viable may not contribute to our operating results until at least a few years after they are completed.\n\n## We face supply chain and manufacturing risks.\n\nWe rely on third parties to supply us with goods and services in a cost-effective and timely manner. Our access to needed goods and services may be adversely affected by potential disputes with suppliers or disruptions in our own or suppliers' operations as a result of, for example: quality excursions; uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets; domestic or international political, social, economic and other conditions; natural events or epidemics in the locations in which our suppliers operate; or limited or delayed access to and high costs of key materials, natural resources, services and utilities. Additionally, a breach or other incident relating to our suppliers' information technology systems could result in a release of confidential or proprietary information. If our suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity, we may be unable to obtain needed supplies, collect accounts receivable or access needed technology.\n\nIn particular, our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment, and those of our suppliers, require that certain key materials, natural resources, services and utilities be available. Suppliers of these items have and might continue to extend lead times, limit supply or increase prices due to factors beyond our control. Limited or delayed access to and high costs of key materials, natural resources, services and utilities could adversely affect our results of operations. Our products contain materials that are subject to conflict minerals reporting requirements. Our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to describe our products as conflict-free. Additionally, our costs may increase if one or more of our customers demand that we change the sourcing of materials we cannot identify as conflict-free.\n\nOur inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations. We have made and will continue to make significant investments in manufacturing capacity, and we might not realize our expected return on those investments. We subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our products, and we depend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development. We do not have long-term contracts with all of these suppliers, and the number of alternate suppliers is limited. Reliance on these suppliers involves risks, including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand, suppliers' inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely, cost-effective, and appropriate manner, the possibility of suppliers' imposition of increased costs on us and the unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property.",

BUSINESS\n\n## Overview\n\nWe are a global technology leader that designs, develops and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. Our over 60-year history of innovation dates back to our diverse origins from AT&amp;T/Bell Labs, Lucent and Hewlett-Packard Company, and evolved with LSI Corporation, Broadcom Corporation, Brocade Communications Systems LLC, CA, Inc., Symantec Enterprise Security, and VMware, Inc. ('VMware'). Over the years, we have assembled a large team of semiconductor and software design engineers around the world. We maintain design, product and software development engineering resources at locations in the U.S., Asia, Europe and Israel, providing us with engineering expertise worldwide. We combine global scale, engineering depth, broad product portfolio diversity, superior execution and operational focus to deliver category-leading semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions.\n\nWe develop semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor ('CMOS') based devices and analog III-V based products.

We differentiate ourselves through our high-performance design and integration capabilities and focus on developing semiconductor products for target markets where we believe we can earn attractive margins.\n\nOur infrastructure software solutions help enterprises simplify their information technology ('IT') environments so they can increase business velocity and flexibility, and enable customers to plan, develop, deliver, automate, manage, and secure applications across mainframe, distributed, edge, mobile, and private and hybrid cloud platforms. Many of the largest companies in the world, including most of the Fortune 500, and many government agencies rely on our software solutions to help manage and secure their on-premises and hybrid cloud environments, private cloud infrastructure and AI data centers. Our portfolio of industry-leading infrastructure and security software is designed to modernize, optimize, and secure the most complex private and hybrid cloud environments, enabling scalability, agility, automation, insights, resiliency and security, making it easy for customers to run their mission-critical workloads. We also offer mission-critical fibre channel storage area networking ('FC SAN') products and related software in the form of modules, switches and subsystems i ncorporating multiple semiconductor products.\n\nOn November 22, 2023, we acquired VMware in a cash-and-stock transaction (the 'VMware Merger'), in which VMware stockholders received, in aggregate, approximately $30.8 billion in cash and 544 million shares of Broadcom common stock (on a split adjusted basis) with a fair value of $53.4 billion. We funded the cash portion of the VMware Merger consideration with net proceeds from the issuance of $30.4 billion in term loans under a credit agreement that we entered into on August 15, 2023, as well as cash on hand. Following the VMware Merger, we sold VMware's end-user computing business to KKR &amp; Co. Inc. for cash consideration of $3.5 billion, after working capital adjustments. With the VMware Merger, we have bolstered our infrastructure software solutions and are able to offer our customers a greater capacity to address complex IT infrastructure issues.\n\n## Business Strategy\n\nOur strategy is focused on technology leadership and category-leading semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions delivering a comprehensive suite of innovative infrastructure technology products to the world's leading business and government customers. We seek to achieve this through strategic acquisitions of businesses and technologies, as well as extensive internal research and development, to ensure our products retain their technology market l eadership. This strategy results in a robust business model designed to drive diversified and sustainable operating and financial results.\n\n## Products and Markets\n\n## Semiconductor Solutions\n\nSemiconductors are made by imprinting a network of electronic components onto a semiconductor wafer. These devices are designed to perform various functions such as processing, amplifying and selectively filtering electronic signals, controlling electronic system functions and processing, and transmitting and storing data. Our digital and mixed signal products are based on silicon wafers with CMOS transistors offering fast switching speeds and low power consumption, which are both critical design factors for the markets we serve. We also offer analog products, which are based on III-V semiconductor materials that have higher electrical conductivity than silicon, and thus tend to have better performance characteristics in radio frequency ('RF'), and optoelectronic applications. III-V refers to elements from the 3rd and 5th groups in the periodic table of chemical elements. Examples of these materials used in our products are gallium arsenide ('GaAs') and indium phosphide ('InP').",

      "answer": "Broadcom's shift from annual equity awards to multi-year equity awards changes the stock-based compensation expense recognition pattern by extending the recognition period from a 4-year vesting cycle per annual grant to a longer 7-year period in total for the multi-year awards. Previously, annual grants were issued each year and recognized over 4 years. Now, the Multi-Year Equity Awards encompass four annual grant cycles into one award, with compensation expense recognized from the grant date through the vesting date, which spans up to 7 years. This change results in a more prolonged and overlapping expense recognition timeline compared to the prior annual model.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, we learn that Broadcom replaced its annual equity awards (historically granted on March 15 of each year) with Multi-Year Equity Awards in fiscal year 2019.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, we understand that these Multi-Year Equity Awards vest on the same basis as four annual grants, with successive four-year vesting periods, and that the company recognizes stock-based compensation expense over a period ranging from 4 to 7 years.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Combining both insights, we see that the new structure extends the expense recognition period and overlaps multiple grant cycles, altering the company\u2019s financial reporting pattern compared to the prior annual model."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## ITEM 1. BUSINESS\n\n## Overview\n\nWe are a global technology leader that designs, develops and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. Our over 60-year history of innovation dates back to our diverse origins from AT&amp;T/Bell Labs, Lucent and Hewlett-Packard Company, and evolved with LSI Corporation, Broadcom Corporation, Brocade Communications Systems LLC, CA, Inc., Symantec Enterprise Security, and VMware, Inc. ('VMware'). Over the years, we have assembled a large team of semiconductor and software design engineers around the world. We maintain design, product and software development engineering resources at locations in the U.S., Asia, Europe and Israel, providing us with engineering expertise worldwide. We combine global scale, engineering depth, broad product portfolio diversity, superior execution and operational focus to deliver category-leading semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions.\n\nWe develop semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor ('CMOS') based devices and analog III-V based products. We offer thousands of products that are used in end products such as enterprise and data center networking, including artificial intelligence ('AI') networking and connectivity, home connectivity, set-top boxes ('STB'), broadband access, telecommunication equipment, smartphones and base stations, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays. We differentiate ourselves through our high-performance design and integration capabilities and focus on developing semiconductor products for target markets where we believe we can earn attractive margins.\n\nOur infrastructure software solutions help enterprises simplify their information technology ('IT') environments so they can increase business velocity and flexibility, and enable customers to plan, develop, deliver, automate, manage, and secure applications across mainframe, distributed, edge, mobile, and private and hybrid cloud platforms. Many of the largest companies in the world, including most of the Fortune 500, and many government agencies rely on our software solutions to help manage and secure their on-premises and hybrid cloud environments, private cloud infrastructure and AI data centers. Our portfolio of industry-leading infrastructure and security software is designed to modernize, optimize, and secure the most complex private and hybrid cloud environments, enabling scalability, agility, automation, insights, resiliency and security, making it easy for customers to run their mission-critical workloads. We also offer mission-critical fibre channel storage area networking ('FC SAN') products and related software in the form of modules, switches and subsystems i ncorporating multiple semiconductor products.\n\nOn November 22, 2023, we acquired VMware in a cash-and-stock transaction (the 'VMware Merger'), in which VMware stockholders received, in aggregate, approximately $30.8 billion in cash and 544 million shares of Broadcom common stock (on a split adjusted basis) with a fair value of $53.4 billion. We funded the cash portion of the VMware Merger consideration with net proceeds from the issuance of $30.4 billion in term loans under a credit agreement that we entered into on August 15, 2023, as well as cash on hand. Following the VMware Merger, we sold VMware's end-user computing business to KKR &amp; Co. Inc. for cash consideration of $3.5 billion, after working capital adjustments. With the VMware Merger, we have bolstered our infrastructure software solutions and are able to offer our customers a greater capacity to address complex IT infrastructure issues.\n\n## Business Strategy\n\nOur strategy is focused on technology leadership and category-leading semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions delivering a comprehensive suite of innovative infrastructure technology products to the world's leading business and government customers. We seek to achieve this through strategic acquisitions of businesses and technologies, as well as extensive internal research and development, to ensure our products retain their technology market l eadership. This strategy results in a robust business model designed to drive diversified and sustainable operating and financial results.\n\n## Products and Markets\n\n## Semiconductor Solutions\n\nSemiconductors are made by imprinting a network of electronic components onto a semiconductor wafer. These devices are designed to perform various functions such as processing, amplifying and selectively filtering electronic signals, controlling electronic system functions and processing, and transmitting and storing data. Our digital and mixed signal products are based on silicon wafers with CMOS transistors offering fast switching speeds and low power consumption, which are both critical design factors for the markets we serve. We also offer analog products, which are based on III-V semiconductor materials that have higher electrical conductivity than silicon, and thus tend to have better performance characteristics in radio frequency ('RF'), and optoelectronic applications. III-V refers to elements from the 3rd and 5th groups in the periodic table of chemical elements. Examples of these materials used in our products are gallium arsenide ('GaAs') and indium phosphide ('InP').",

          "chunk_text": "## QUALCOMM Incorporated\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies\n\nWe are a global technology leader, helping to bring intelligent computing everywhere through the development and commercialization of foundational technologies, including 3G (third generation), 4G (fourth generation) and 5G (fifth generation) wireless connectivity, high-performance and low-power computing and on-device artificial intelligence (AI). Our technologies and products have helped power the growth in smartphones and other connected devices. We are scaling our innovations across industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, including automotive and the internet of things (IoT). We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products and through the licensing of our intellectual property, including patents and other rights.\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities and operating results of Qualcomm, its subsidiaries and any variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary (Note 2). Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\nFinancial Statement Preparation. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the disclosure of contingent amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Examples of our significant accounting estimates and policies that may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others include: the estimation of sales-based royalty revenues; the impairment of non-marketable equity investments; the valuation of inventories; the impairment of goodwill, other indefinite-lived assets and long-lived assets; the recognition, measurement and disclosure of loss contingencies related to legal and regulatory proceedings; and the calculation of our income tax provision, including the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\n\nFiscal Year. We operate and report using a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in September. Fiscal 2024 included 53 weeks, and fiscal years 2023 and 2022 included 52 weeks. Our fiscal year for 2025 will include 52 weeks.\n\nCash Equivalents. We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents may be comprised of money market funds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate bonds and notes and certain bank time deposits, U.S. Treasury securities and governmentrelated securities. The carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments.\n\nMarketable Securities. Marketable securities include marketable equity securities, available-for-sale debt securities and, from time-to-time, certain time deposits. We classify marketable securities as current or noncurrent based on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current operations. Marketable securities are stated at fair value with all realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments in marketable equity securities and realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities recognized in investment and other income (expense), net. Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity at the time of purchase and reevaluated at each balance sheet date. The realized and unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities are determined using the specific identification method.\n\nIf a debt security has an unrealized loss and we either intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery, we record an impairment charge to investment and other income (expense), net for the entire amount of the unrealized loss and adjust the amortized cost basis of the security. For the remaining debt securities, if an unrealized loss ex ists, we separate the impairment into the portion of the loss related to credit factors and the portion of the loss that is not related to credit factors. Unrealized gains or unrealized losses that are not related to credit factors on available-forsale debt securities are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes. Unrealized losses that are related to credit loss factors on available-for-sale debt securities and subsequent adjustments to the credit loss are recorded as an allowance for credit losses, which is included in investment and other income (expense), net. In evaluating whether a credit loss exists, we consider a variety of factors, including the significance of the decline in value as compared to the cost basis; underlying factors contributing to a decline in the prices of securities in a single asset class; the security's relative performance versus its peers, sector or asset class; the market and economy in general; views of external investment managers; news or financial information that has been released specific to the investee; and the outlook for the overall industry in which the investee operates.\n\nEquity Method and Non-marketable Equity Investments. Equity investments in common stock or in-substance common stock for which we have significant influence, but not control, over the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee's activities are accounted for under the equity method. Our share of gains and losses in equity method investments are recorded in investment and other income (expense), net. We eliminate unrealized profit or loss related to transactions with equity method investees in relation to our ownership interest in the investee, which is recorded as a component of equity in net earnings (losses) in investees in investment and other income (expense), net. Non-marketable equity investments (for which we do not have significant influence or control) are investments without readily determinable fair values that are generally recorded based on initial cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus adjustments resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar securities, if any. All gains and losses on investments in non-marketable equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recognized in investment and other income (expense), net. We monitor equity method and non-marketable equity investments for events or circumstances that could indicate the investments are impaired, such as a deterioration in the investee's financial condition and business forecasts and lower",

Similarly, if, due to U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, we were limited in or prohibited from obtaining critical integrated circuit products from our suppliers in China, or we or our customers were limited in or prohibited from selling in the United States products containing technologies with Chinese-origin content, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially harmed. See also the Risk Factors titled ' We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier handset devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected ' and ' Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).'\n\nFor example, we previously sold 4G and other integrated circuit products, including Wi-Fi products, but excluding 5G products, to Huawei under export licenses from the U.S. Department of Commerce. On May 7, 2024, the U.S. Department of Commerce informed us that it was revoking our license to export 4G and certain other integrated circuit products to Huawei, effective immediately, and we implemented procedures to immediately comply. Accordingly, we do not expect to receive any further product revenues from Huawei. Product revenues from Huawei in fiscal 2024, prior to our license being revoked on May 7, 2024, were approximately $560 million. Additionally, to the ex tent that Huawei's devices take share from Chinese OEMs that utilize our products or from non-Chinese OEMs that utilize our products in devices they sell into China, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows could be further impacted.\n\nFinally, government policies in China that regulate the amount and timing of funds that may flow out of the country have impacted and may continue to impact the timing of our receipt of, and/or ability to receive, payments from our customers and licensees in China, which may negatively impact our cash flows.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO NEW INITIATIVES\n\nOur growth depends in part on our ability to extend our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets.

          "chunk_text": "## QUALCOMM Incorporated\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nFair Value Measurements. Fair value is defined as the ex change price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an ex it price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. Applicable accounting guidance provides an established hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of us. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the factors that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:\n\n- Level 1 includes financial instruments for which quoted market prices for identical instruments are available in active markets.\n- Level 2 includes financial instruments for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the instrument.\n- Level 3 includes financial instruments for which fair value is derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable, including our own assumptions.\n\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. We review the fair value hierarchy classification on a quarterly basis. Changes in the observability of valuation inputs may result in a reclassification of levels for certain securities within the fair value hierarchy. We recognize transfers into and out of levels within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the fiscal month in which the actual event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer to occur.\n\nCash Equivalents and Marketable Securities: We obtain pricing information from quoted market prices, pricing vendors or quotes from brokers/dealers. We conduct reviews of our primary pricing vendors to determine whether the inputs used in the vendor's pricing processes are deemed to be observable. Contractual sale restrictions are not considered in measuring the fair value of marketable equity securities. The fair value for interest-bearing securities includes accrued interest. The fair value of U.S. Treasury securities and government-related securities, corporate bonds and notes and common stock is generally determined using standard observable inputs, including reported trades, market based quotes, matrix pricing, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets and/or benchmark securities. The fair value of mortgage- and asset-backed securities is derived from the use of matrix pricing (prices for similar securities) or, in some cases, cash flow pricing models with observable inputs, such as contractual terms, maturity, credit rating and/or securitization structure to determine the timing and amount of future cash flows.\n\nDerivative Instruments: Derivative instruments that are traded on an exchange are valued using quoted market prices and are included in Level 1. Derivative instruments that are not traded on an exchange are valued using conventional calculations/models that are primarily based on observable inputs, such as foreign currency exchange rates, volatilities and interest rates, and therefore, such derivative instruments are included in Level 2.\n\nOther Investments and Other Liabilities: Other investments and other liabilities included in Level 1 are comprised of our deferred compensation plan liabilities and related assets, which consist of mutual funds and are included in other current assets and other assets. Gains and losses on the revaluation of our deferred compensation plan assets are recorded in investment and other income (expense), net. Corresponding offsetting amounts related to the revaluation of our deferred compensation plan liabilities are included in operating ex penses. Other investments included in Level 3 are comprised of convertible debt instruments issued by private companies. The inputs we use to estimate the fair values of these instruments are generally unobservable, and therefore, they are included in Level 3.\n\nNonrecurring Fair Value Measurements: We measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets and liabilities include equity method and non-marketable equity investments, assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition or in a nonmonetary exchange, and property, plant and equipment and intangible assets that are written down to fair value when they are held for sale or determined to be impaired, all of which are generally measured based on unobservable inputs using an income or market approach.\n\nInventories. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value using the first-in, first-out method. Recoverability of inventories is assessed based on review of future customer demand that considers multiple factors, including committed purchase orders from customers as well as purchase commitment projections provided by customers and our own forecasts of customer demand, among other factors. This valuation also requires us to make judgments and assumptions based on information currently available about market conditions, including competition, anticipated technological changes, internal product life cycle and development plans, product pricing and other broader market conditions that may impact customer demand, such as the impact of the macroeconomic environment in fiscal 2022 and 2023. We generally place binding purchase orders with our suppliers in advance of receiving contractually binding forecasts and/or purchase orders from our customers. The time period between placing purchase orders with our suppliers and receiving contractually binding forecasts and/or purchase orders from our customers has increased and may continue to increase as a result of extended manufacturing lead-times, driven in part by a continued transition to leading-edge technologies and/or increased complexity in the manufacturing process of our products. If we overestimate demand for our products, the amount of our loss will be impacted by our ability to reduce inventory purchases from our suppliers. Further, if our customers cancel purchase orders or alter forecasts this may result in excess inventory on hand. Our assumptions of future product demand are",

Many of our customers and their contract manufacturers often require time critical delivery of our products to multiple locations around the world. With sales offices located in various countries, our primary warehouse in Malaysia, and dedicated regional customer support call centers, where we address customer issues and handle logistics and other order fulfillment requirements, we believe we are well-positioned to support our customers throughout the design, technology transfer and manufacturing stages across all geographies.\n\nOur software customers are in most major industries worldwide, including banks, insurance companies, other financial services providers, government agencies, global IT service providers, telecommunication providers, transportation companies, manufacturers, technology companies, retailers, educational organizations and health care institutions. Our customers generally consist of large enterprises that have computing environments from multiple vendors and are highly complex. We remain focused on strengthening relationships and increasing penetration within our existing core, mainframe-centric, and Symantec endpoint customers and expanding the adoption of our enterprise software offerings with these customers. We believe our enterprise-wide license model will continue to offer our customers reduced complexity, more flexibility and an easier renewal process that will help drive revenue growth.\n\n## Manufacturing Operations\n\nWe focus on maintaining an efficient global supply chain and a variable, low-cost operating model. Accordingly, we outsource a majority of our manufacturing operations, utilizing third-party foundry and assembly and test capabilities, as well as some of our corporate infrastructure functions. The majority of our front-end wafer manufacturing operations is outsourced to external foundries, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited ('TSMC'). We use third-party contract manufacturers for a significant majority of our assembly and test operations, including Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc., Foxconn Technology Group, Amkor Technology, Inc. and Siliconware Precision Industries Co., Ltd. We use our internal fabrication facilities for products utilizing our innovative and proprietary processes, such as our FBAR filters for wireless communications and our vertical-cavity surface emitting laser and side emitting lasers-based on GaAs and InP lasers for fiber optic communications, while outsourcing commodity processes such as standard CMOS. By doing so, we can protect our IP and accelerate time to market for our products. The majority of our internal III-V semiconductor wafer fabrication is done in the U.S. and Singapore.\n\nWe also have a long history of operating in Asia where we manufacture and source the majority of our products and materials. We store the majority of our product inventory in our warehouse in Malaysia and our presence in Asia places us in close proximity to many of our customers' manufacturing facilities.\n\n## Manufacturing Materials and Suppliers\n\nOur manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors, electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials. We purchase materials from hundreds of suppliers on a global basis. These purchases are generally on a purchase order basis and some parts are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time and cost necessary for re-design or qualification. To address the potential disruption in our supply chain, we may use a number of techniques, including redesigning products for alternative components, making incremental or 'lifetime' purchases, or qualifying more than one source of supply. Our long-term relationships with our suppliers allow us to proactively manage our technology development and product discontinuance plans, and to monitor our suppliers' financial health. Some suppliers may, nonetheless, extend their lead times, limit supplies, increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products. If these are unique or highly specialized components, we may not be able to find a substitute quickly, or at all.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe markets in which we participate are highly competitive. Our competitors range from large, international companies offering a wide range of products to smaller companies specializing in narrow markets. The competitive landscape is changing as a result of a trend toward consolidation within many industries, as some of our competitors have merged with or been acquired by other competitors, while others have begun collaborating with each other. We expect this consolidation trend to continue. We expect competition in the markets in which we participate to continue to increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings and as new companies enter the market. Additionally, our ability to compete effectively depends on a number of factors, including: quality, technical performance, price, product features, product system",

We also offer mission critical fibre channel storage area networking ('FC SAN') products and related software in the form of modules, switches and subsystems incorporating multiple semiconductor products. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to 'Broadcom,' 'we,' 'our,' and 'us' mean Broadcom and its consolidated subsidiaries.\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to October 31 in a 52-week year and the first Sunday in November in a 53-week year. Our fiscal year ended October 30, 2022 ('fiscal year 2022') was a 52week fiscal year. The first quarter of our fiscal year 2022 ended on January 30, 2022, the second quarter ended on May 1, 2022 and the third quarter ended on July 31, 2022. Our fiscal year ended October 31, 2021 ('fiscal year 2021') and fiscal year ended November 1, 2020 ('fiscal year 2020') were both 52-week fiscal years.\n\nOn November 4, 2019, we completed the purchase of certain assets and assumption of certain liabilities of the Symantec Corporation Enterprise Security business (the 'Symantec Business'). We have two reportable segments: semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. See Note 13. 'Segment Information' for additional information.\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Broadcom and its subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ('GAAP'). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\n## 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nForeign currency remeasurement. We operate in a U.S. dollar functional currency environment. Foreign currency assets and liabilities for monetary accounts are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates. Non-monetary items such as inventory and property, plant and equipment, are measured and recorded at historical exchange rates. The effects of foreign currency remeasurement were not material for any period presented.\n\nUse of estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The inputs into certain of these estimates and assumptions include the consideration of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and many of these estimates could require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, and such differences could affect the results of operations reported in future periods.\n\nCash and cash equivalents. We consider all highly liquid investment securities with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. We determine the appropriate classification of our cash and cash equivalents at the time of purchase.\n\nTrade accounts receivable, net. Trade accounts receivable are recognized at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is our best estimate of the expected credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We determine the allowance based on historical experience, current economic conditions and certain forward-looking information, among other factors. Allowances for doubtful accounts were not material as of October 30, 2022 or October 31, 2021. Accounts receivable are also recognized net of sales returns and distributor credit allowances. These amounts are recognized when it is both probable and estimable that discounts will be granted or products will be returned. Allowances for sales returns and distributor credit allowances as of October 30, 2022 and October 31, 2021 were $126 million and $129 million, respectively.",

      "question": "How does the introduction of the 0.875% Notes due 2030 by IBM in 2023 relate to its broader debt instrument disclosures, and what does this imply about IBM's long-term financing strategy based on the specific instruments listed in the 10-K filing?",
      "answer": "IBM introduced the 0.875% Notes due 2030 as part of its long-term financing strategy, which is evident from the detailed listing of various debt instruments in the 10-K filing. The 0.875% Notes due 2030 are specifically mentioned in the list of traded securities, indicating their active role in IBM's capital structure. Additionally, the filing incorporates the instrument defining the rights of the holders of these notes as Exhibit 4.1 to Form 8-K, filed February 8, 2022, showing the formalization and transparency of this financial instrument. This aligns with IBM's broader approach of issuing a diverse set of notes with varying maturities and interest rates, such as the 1.750% Notes due 2028 and the 3.625% Notes due 2031, to manage its long-term financial obligations and maintain flexibility in capital markets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - The instrument defining the rights of the holders of the 0.875% Notes due 2030 is incorporated by reference as Exhibit 4.1 to Form 8-K, filed February 8, 2022.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - The 0.875% Notes due 2030 are listed under traded securities with the symbol IBM 30A on the New York Stock Exchange.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The combination of the formal documentation of the instrument and its listing on a major exchange indicates IBM's strategic use of long-term debt instruments to finance operations and manage capital structure."
