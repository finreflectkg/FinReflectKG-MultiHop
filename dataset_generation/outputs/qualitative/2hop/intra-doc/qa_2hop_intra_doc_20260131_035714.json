This activity includes the share repurchases under the ASR transactions described below.\n\nPursuant to the authorization under the 2021 Repurchase Program, the Company entered into a $3.0 billion fixed dollar ASR with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC ('Morgan Stanley'). Upon payment of the $3.0 billion purchase price on January 4, 2024, the Company received a number of shares of CVS Health Corporation's common stock equal to 85% of the $3.0 billion notional amount of the ASR or approximately 31.4 million shares, which were placed into treasury stock in January 2024. The ASR was accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction for $2.6 billion and a forward contract for $0.4 billion. The forward contract was classified as an equity instrument and was recorded within capital surplus. In March 2024, the Company received approximately 8.3 million shares of CVS Health Corporation's common stock, representing the remaining 15% of the $3.0 billion notional amount of the ASR, thereby concluding the ASR. These shares were placed into treasury and the forward contract was reclassified from capital surplus to treasury stock in March 2024.\n\nPursuant to the authorization under the 2021 Repurchase Program, the Company entered into a $2.0 billion fixed dollar ASR with Citibank, N.A.

These risks are particularly acute during periods when health care and other benefit costs, utilization and/or medical cost trends experience significant volatility and medical claim submission patterns are changing rapidly, as they did during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such risks are further magnified by the ACA and other existing and future legislation and regulations that limit our ability to price for our projected and/or ex perienced increases in utilization and/or medical cost trends.\n\n## Adverse economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad can materially and adversely impact our businesses, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nAdverse economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad, including those caused by inflation, high interest rates, declines in consumer confidence, increases in unemployment and supply chain disruptions, all of which we have experienced over the last number of years, can materially and adversely impact our businesses, operating results, cash flows and financial condition, including:\n\n- In our Health Care Benefits segment, by causing unanticipated increases and volatility in utilization of covered services, increases in fraudulent claims and disputes, changes in medical claim submission patterns and/or increases in medical unit costs and/or provider behavior as hospitals and other providers attempt to maintain revenue levels in response to economic conditions, each of which would increase our costs and limit our ability to accurately detect, forecast, manage, reserve and price for our (and our self-insured customers') medical cost trends and incurred and future health care and other benefits costs; causing customers and potential customers of our Health Care Benefits segment, particularly smaller employers and individuals, to forego obtaining or renewing their health and other coverage with us; and also affect our ability to profitably grow and diversify our Health Care Benefits membership.\n- In our Health Services segment, by causing drug utilization to decline, reducing demand for PBM services and adversely affecting the financial health of our PBM clients.\n- In our Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment, by causing drug utilization to decline, changing consumer purchasing power, preferences and/or spending patterns leading to reduced consumer demand for products sold in our stores, potentially increasing levels of theft at our retail locations and adversely affecting the financial health of our LTC pharmacy customers.\n- By causing our existing customers to reduce workforces (including due to business failures), which would reduce our revenues, the number of covered lives in our PBM clients and/or the number of members our Health Care Benefits segment serves. Reductions in workforce by our customers can also cause unanticipated increases in the health care and other benefits costs of our Health Care Benefits segment.

There can be no assurance that future health care and other benefits costs will not exceed our projections.\n\nPremiums for our Insured Health Care Benefits products, which comprised 94% of our Health Care Benefits segment revenues for 2024, are priced in advance based on our forecasts of health care and other benefit costs during a fix ed premium period, which is generally twelve months. These forecasts are typically developed several months before the fixed premium period begins, are influenced by historical data (and recent historical data in particular), are dependent on our ability to anticipate and detect medical cost trends and changes in our members' behavior and health care utilization patterns and medical claim submission patterns and require a significant degree of judgment. For example, our revenue on Individual Medicare policies is based on bids submitted in June of the year before the contract year. Cost increases in excess of our projections cannot be recovered in the fixed premium period through higher premiums. As a result, our profits are particularly sensitive to the accuracy of our forecasts of the increases in health care and other benefit costs that we ex pect to incur and our ability to anticipate and detect medical cost trends. During periods when health care and other benefit costs, utilization and/or medical costs trends experience significant volatility and medical claim submission patterns are changing rapidly, as they did during the COVID-19 pandemic, accurately detecting, forecasting, managing, reserving and pricing for our (and our self-insured customers') medical cost trends and incurred and future health care and other benefits costs is more challenging. There can be no assurance regarding the accuracy of the health care or other benefit cost projections reflected in our pricing, and whether our health care and other benefit costs will be affected by pandemics, disease outbreaks and other external events over which we have no control. Even relatively small differences between predicted and actual health care and other benefit costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant adverse changes in our Health Care Benefits segment's operating results.\n\nWhile the public health emergency related to COVID-19 expired in May 2023, COVID-19 still exists and it may, like many other respiratory viruses, wax and wane depending on geography and seasonality. The future impact COVID-19 will have on the Company and its ability to accurately forecast health care and other benefit costs is uncertain, and will depend on geographies impacted, whether new variants emerge and their severity, the availability and costs of testing, vaccination and treatment, and legal and regulatory actions. COVID-19 may also impact provider behavior, utilization trends, membership, and overall economic conditions. These impacts could be adverse and material.\n\nA number of factors contribute to rising health care and other benefit costs, including previously uninsured members entering the health care system; Medicare members' utilization of supplemental benefits; other changes in members' behavior, health care utilization patterns and utilization management; turnover in our membership, health care provider and member fraud; additional government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, including changes to or as a result of the ACA and IRA; changes in the health status of our members; the aging of the population and other changing demographic characteristics; advances in medical technology; increases in the number and cost of prescription drugs (including specialty pharmacy drugs and ultra-high cost drugs and therapies); direct-to-consumer marketing by drug manufacturers; the increasing influence of social media on our members' health care utilization and other behaviors; the shift to a consumer-driven business model; changes in health care practices and general economic conditions (such as inflation and employment levels); increases in labor costs; pandemics, epidemics or disease outbreaks; influenza-related health care costs (which may be substantial and higher than we expected); clusters of high-cost cases; natural disasters and extreme weather events (which may increase in frequency or intensity as a result of climate change); and numerous other factors that are or may be beyond our control. For example, the length and severity of the influenza season can have an impact on health care and other benefit costs. In 2022-2023 influenza season had an earlier than average start, including as compared to the 2023-2024 influenza season; the 2020-2021 influenza season was impacted by efforts taken to reduce the spread of COVID-19; and the 2019-2020 influenza season maintained a high level of severity for a longer period of time than average. In addition, government-imposed limitations on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements to health plans and providers have caused the private sector to bear a greater share of increasing health care and other benefits costs over time, and future amendments to the ACA that increase the uninsured population may amplify this issue.\n\nOur Health Care Benefits segment's operating results and competitiveness depend in large part on our ability to appropriately manage future health care and other benefit costs through underwriting criteria, product design, provider network configuration, negotiation of favorable provider contracts and medical management programs. Our medical cost management programs may not be successful and may have a smaller impact on health care and benefit costs than we expect. The factors described above may adversely affect our ability to predict and manage health care and other benefit costs, which can adversely affect our competitiveness and operating results.",

      "answer": "CVS recorded $483 million in store impairment charges in 2024 as part of its enterprise-wide restructuring plan. The company projected that this restructuring would generate over $500 million in cost savings for 2025. Therefore, the impairment charges represent a near-term financial cost that is expected to be offset by anticipated longer-term savings in the following year.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_b, extract the specific store impairment charge of $483 million recorded in 2024 related to the enterprise-wide restructuring plan.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_a, extract the expected cost savings of over $500 million in 2025 from the same restructuring plan.",
        "Step 3: Compare the two figures to understand the financial trade-off: the near-term cost of $483 million in impairments is expected to lead to more than $500 million in savings the following year."

          "chunk_text": "## 2025 Outlook\n\nThe Company believes you should consider the following key business and regulatory trends and uncertainties:\n\n## Key Business Trends and Uncertainties\n\n- The Company expects medical membership declines in its Medicare and individual exchange products. Medical membership disruptions may result in volatility in the Company's financial results.\n- Utilization persisted at elevated levels through the fourth quarter of 2024. Although the level of utilization is difficult to accurately predict, at this time, the Company expects that continued elevated utilization will pressure its Health Care Benefits segment and its health care delivery assets in its Health Services segment into 2025.\n- Increases in utilization beyond the Company's projections may also result in the Company having to record premium deficiency reserves within in the Health Care Benefits segment during 2025.\n- The Company's Medicaid business is experiencing medical cost pressures, largely driven by higher than expected acuity following the resumption of member redeterminations. While the Company continues to work closely with its state partners to ensure the underlying trends are reflected in its premium rates going forward, it is uncertain when these pressures will be fully offset by state rate updates.\n- The Company's individual exchange business is subject to a risk adjustment program whereby the Company estimates its ultimate risk adjustment receivable or payable based on the risk of its qualified plan members relative to the average risk of members of other qualified plans in comparable markets. Changes in the Company's risk relative to the markets' risk, including changes resulting from volatility in membership, could adversely impact the Company's estimate of its risk adjustment receivable or payable.\n- The Company continues to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread.' The Company expects these trends to continue.\n- Glucagon-like peptide 1 ('GLP-1') supply disruptions, and the associated impact on product mix, could pressure the Company's ability to deliver savings to clients and could impact the Company's results.\n- Regulatory changes or consumer sentiment shift for immunizations may negatively impact national demand impacting financial results.\n- Implementation of new tariffs create exposure for increased costs and supply chain disruptions that can adversely impact consumer demand or financial results.\n- Consumer spend management and a decline in consumer discretionary spending, as well as a shift to value, grocery and digital retailers, could drive lower front store sales.\n- Future financial performance will be influenced by a number of factors including competitive demand for products and services, legislative and regulatory considerations, and labor and other market dynamics, including inflation. The Company evaluates and adjusts its approach in each of the markets it serves, considering all relevant factors.\n- The Company expects benefits from ongoing enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives and investments in efficiencies, which aim to reduce the Company's operating cost structure in a way that improves the consumer experience and is sustainable. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company finalized an enterprise-wide restructuring plan intended to streamline and simplify the organization, improve efficiency and generate expected cost savings of over $500 million in 2025. Refer to Note 3 ''Restructuring'' for actions implemented under the plan.\n- Changes in conditions in the U.S. and global capital markets can significantly and adversely affect interest rates and capital market conditions which could result in increased financing costs.\n- Actions taken by ratings agencies, including changes in the Company's debt ratings, could impact the Company's future borrowing costs, access to capital markets and new store operating lease costs.\n\n## Key Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties\n\n- The Company is exposed to funding and regulation of, and changes in government policy with respect to and/or funding or regulation of, the various Medicare programs in which the Company participates, including changes in the amounts payable to us under those programs and/or new reforms or surcharges on existing programs, including changes to applicable risk adjustment mechanisms.\n- Legislation and/or regulations seeking to regulate PBM activities in a comprehensive manner have been proposed or enacted in a majority of states and on the federal level. This legislative and regulatory activity could adversely affect",

Pharmacy lease amounts due in excess of the remaining estimated economic life of the buildings of approximately $2.2 billion are not reflected in this table since the estimated economic life of the buildings is shorter than the contractual term of the pharmacy lease arrangement.\n\n## Store Impairment Charges\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded a store impairment charge of $483 million related to operating and financing lease right-of-use assets in connection with its enterprise-wide restructuring plan.

      "answer": "The decline in Comirnaty's global revenue from $37,806 million in 2022 to $11,220 million in 2023, a 70% drop, significantly affected Pfizer's operational results, driven by lower contracted deliveries and demand in international markets and the transition to traditional U.S. commercial market sales. This decline was compounded by Pfizer's ongoing collaboration agreement with BioNTech, under which Pfizer agreed to pay BioNTech tiered royalties and share gross profits from Comirnaty sales globally, excluding certain regions. Despite the revenue drop, Pfizer retained global commercialization rights (excluding Germany, Turkey, and certain Asian regions) and continued to share development and commercialization profits with BioNTech, creating ongoing financial obligations even as revenue declined.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Comirnaty's global revenue dropped from $37,806 million in 2022 to $11,220 million in 2023, a 70% decline, due to lower contracted deliveries and demand in international markets and the transition to traditional U.S. commercial market sales.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Pfizer and BioNTech share development and commercialization costs and profits for Comirnaty, with Pfizer receiving BioNTech's 50% share of prior development costs in early 2021 and recognizing revenues and costs on a gross basis in markets where Pfizer commercializes the vaccine.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The significant drop in Comirnaty revenue negatively impacted Pfizer's operational results, while the collaboration agreement with BioNTech required continued profit sharing and royalty payments, creating a dual financial pressure despite declining sales."

      "answer": "Under Pfizer's 2019 Stock Plan, Performance Share Awards (PSAs) count as three shares toward the maximum shares available for grant, multiplied by the maximum potential payout. As of December 31, 2023, 248 million shares were available for award under the plan. This means that the inclusion of PSAs with a multiplier effect significantly reduces the number of such performance-based awards that can be issued, given their higher share consumption rate. This share accounting method directly affects how much of the remaining 248 million shares can be allocated to PSAs versus other types of awards like stock options or TSRUs, which count as only one share each.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - PSAs count as three shares times the maximum potential payout toward the maximum shares available under the 2019 Plan.",

      "answer": "Pfizer paid BioNTech $75 million as an upfront payment for the development of the mRNA-based shingles vaccine. This collaboration follows a similar structure to the Comirnaty vaccine partnership, where both companies share development costs and commercialization rights globally, excluding certain regions. In both collaborations, Pfizer holds a small equity stake in BioNTech, with 2.7% as of December 31, 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Comirnaty is an mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine developed through a collaboration between Pfizer and BioNTech, with shared development costs and global commercialization rights excluding Germany, Turkey, and certain regions in Asia.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Pfizer entered into a research, development, and commercialization agreement with BioNTech for an mRNA-based shingles vaccine, paying $75 million upfront, sharing development costs, and having global commercialization rights excluding Germany, Turkey, and certain developing countries.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The structure of the shingles vaccine collaboration mirrors the Comirnaty partnership, including cost-sharing, profit-sharing, and similar regional exclusions for commercialization."

The original cost and the net book value of such assets were $3.9 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\n## Note 12 - Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures\n\nCertain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates primarily for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts, with gross notional amounts totaling $7.0 billion at December 31, 2024, and $7.3 billion at December 31, 2023, are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates and are recorded at fair value. Accumulated gains and losses as of December 31, 2024 will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally through the next twelve to eighteen months.\n\nAbbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage currency exposures for foreign currency denominated third-party trade payables and receivables, and for intercompany loans and trade accounts payable where the receivable or payable is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. For intercompany loans, the contracts require Abbott to sell or buy foreign currencies, primarily European currencies, in exchange for primarily U.S. dollars and European currencies. For intercompany and trade payables and receivables, the currency exposures are primarily the U.S. dollar and European currencies. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Abbott held gross notional amounts of $16.2 billion and $13.8 billion, respectively, of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts.\n\nAbbott has designated a yen-denominated, 5-year term loan of approximately $583 million and $419 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The change in the value of the debt is due to the net incremental borrowing of $201 million discussed in Note 10 - Debt and Lines of Credit, as well as changes in foreign exchange rates, recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax .\n\nAbbott is a party to interest rate hedge contracts to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt. These contracts are designated as fair value hedges of the variability of the fair value of fix ed-rate debt due to changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates. The effect of the hedge is to change a fix ed-rate interest obligation to a variable rate for that portion of the debt. Abbott records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fix ed-rate debt by an offsetting amount. Abbott had interest rate contracts totaling approximately $2.2 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023.",

      "answer": "Abbott's Diabetes Care business generated $6.805 billion in revenue in 2024, representing an 18.1% increase from the prior year. This growth aligns with Abbott's core business of producing health care products, including Diabetes Care Devices. The revenue from these devices is recognized upon the transfer of control, which occurs upon shipment or delivery, depending on the customer contract terms. This revenue recognition policy ensures that sales from Diabetes Care Devices are recorded in the period when control is transferred to the customer, supporting the reported increase in revenue.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nNATURE OF BUSINESS - Abbott's principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of health care products.\n\nBASIS OF CONSOLIDATION - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions.\n\nUSE OF ESTIMATES - The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions by management. Actual results could differ from those amounts. Significant estimates include  amounts  for  sales  rebates,  income  tax es,  pension  and  other  post-employment  benefits,  valuation  of  intangible  assets,  litigation,  derivative  financial instruments, and inventory and accounts receivable exposures.\n\nFOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION - The statements of earnings of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the period. The net assets of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates are recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment account, which is included in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Transaction gains and losses are recorded on the Net foreign exchange (gain) loss line of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.\n\nREVENUE RECOGNITION - Revenue from product sales is recognized upon the transfer of control, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms set forth in the customer contract. Provisions for discounts, rebates and sales incentives to customers, and returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded. Sales incentives to customers are not material. Historical data is readily available and reliable, and is used for estimating the amount of the reduction in gross sales. Revenue from the launch of a new product, from an improved version of an existing product, or for shipments in excess of a customer's normal requirements are recorded when the conditions noted above are met. In those situations, management records a returns reserve for such revenue, if necessary. In certain Abbott businesses, primarily within diagnostics, Abbott participates in selling arrangements that include multiple performance obligations (e.g., instruments, reagents, procedures, and service agreements). The total transaction price of the contract is allocated to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation.\n\nINCOME TAXES - Deferred income taxes are provided for the tax effect of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements at the enacted statutory rate to be in effect when the taxes are paid. No additional income taxes have been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), or any additional outside basis differences that exist, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. The TCJA subjects taxpayers to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. Abbott treats the GIL TI tax as a period expense and provides for the tax in the year that the tax is incurred. Interest and penalties on income tax obligations are included in taxes on earnings.\n\nEARNINGS PER SHARE - Unvested restricted stock units and awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends are treated as participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share under the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities. Net earnings allocated to common shares in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $13.351 billion, $5.701 billion and $6.905 billion, respectively.\n\nPENSION AND POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS - Abbott accrues for the actuarially determined cost of pension and post-employment benefits over the service attribution periods of the employees. Abbott must develop long-term assumptions, the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates, discount rates and the expected return on plan assets. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over a five-year period. Actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method.",

      "answer": "Abbott Laboratories uses interest rate hedge contracts totaling $2.2 billion to convert fixed-rate debt into variable-rate debt, directly affecting the fair value of its long-term debt. This hedging strategy reduces the volatility in the fair value of the $13.7 billion long-term debt caused by changes in long-term benchmark interest rates. Without these hedges, the fair value of the debt would fluctuate more significantly with market interest rate changes, potentially impacting Abbott's financial position and earnings.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Abbott had interest rate contracts totaling approximately $2.2 billion at December 31, 2024, used to manage exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The fair value of long-term debt at December 31, 2024, was $13.7 billion, with an average interest rate of 3.8%, and Abbott does not use interest rate derivatives for investment securities.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The $2.2 billion in interest rate hedge contracts is specifically used to mitigate the fair value risk of the $13.7 billion in long-term fixed-rate debt by converting it to variable-rate debt, thereby stabilizing its fair value in response to interest rate fluctuations."

These contracts, with gross notional amounts totaling $7.0 billion at December 31, 2024, and $7.3 billion at December 31, 2023, are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates and are recorded at fair value.

For intercompany loans, the contracts require Abbott to sell or buy foreign currencies, primarily European currencies, in exchange for primarily U.S. dollars and European currencies. For intercompany and trade payables and receivables, the currency exposures are primarily the U.S. dollar and European currencies. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Abbott held gross notional amounts of $16.2 billion and $13.8 billion, respectively, of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts.\n\nAbbott has designated a yen-denominated, 5-year term loan of approximately $583 million and $419 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\n## Financial Instruments and Risk Management\n\n## Market Price Sensitive Investments\n\nThe fair value of equity securities held by Abbott with a readily determinable fair value was approximately $10 million and $12 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These equity securities are subject to potential changes in fair value. A hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease their fair value at December 31, 2024 by approximately $2 million. Changes in the fair value of these securities are recorded in earnings. The fair value of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan was approximately $313 million and $314 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Changes in the fair value of these investments, as well as an offsetting change in the benefit obligation, are recorded in earnings.\n\n## Non-Publicly Traded E quity Securities\n\nAbbott holds equity securities that are not traded on public stock exchanges. The carrying value of these investments was $91 million and $88 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. No individual investment is recorded at a value in excess of $20 million. Abbott measures these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.\n\n## Interest Rate Sensitive Financial Instruments\n\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, Abbott had interest rate hedge contracts with notional values totaling $2.2 billion to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of debt. The effect of these hedges is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate for the portion of the debt that is hedged. Abbott does not use derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for its investment securities. The fair value of longterm debt at December 31, 2024 and 2023 amounted to $13.7 billion and $14.8 billion, respectively (average interest rates of 3.8% and 3.6% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023,  respectively)  with  maturities  through  2046.  At  December  31,  2024  and  2023,  the  fair  value  of  current  and  long-term  investment  securities  amounted  to approximately $1.2 billion. A hypothetical 100-basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material effect on cash flows, income or fair values.\n\n## Foreign Currency Sensitive Financial Instruments\n\nCertain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar.

In  addition,  the  agreement provides  for  contingent  payments  from  Merck  to  Eisai  related  to  the  successful  achievement  of  sales-based  and  regulatory milestones.

(IAVI),  a  nonprofit  scientific  research organization  dedicated  to  addressing  urgent,  unmet  global  health  challenges,  announced  a  collaboration  to  develop  V590,  an investigational  vaccine  against  SARS-CoV-2  being  studied  for  the  prevention  of  COVID-19.  The  agreement  provided  for  an upfront payment by Merck of $6.5 million and also provided for future contingent payments based on sales. Merck also signed an agreement  with  the  Biomedical Advanced  Research  and  Development Authority  (BARDA),  part  of  the  office  of  the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response within an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, to provide initial funding support to Merck for this effort. In January 2021, the Company announced it was discontinuing development of V590 as discussed below.\n\nIn January 2021, the Company announced the discontinuation of the development programs for its COVID-19 vaccine candidates, V590 and V591, following Merck's review of findings from Phase 1 clinical studies for the vaccines. In these studies, both  V590  and  V591  were  generally  well  tolerated,  but  the  immune  responses  were  inferior  to  those  seen  following  natural infection  and  those  reported  for  other  SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19  vaccines.  Due  to  the  discontinuation,  the  Company  recorded  a charge of $305 million in 2020, of which $260 million was reflected in Cost of sales and  related  to  fixed  assets  and  materials written off, as well as the recognition of liabilities for purchase commitments . The remaining $45 million of costs were reflected in Research and development expenses and represent amounts related to the Themis acquisition noted above (an IPR&amp;D impairment charge, partially offset by a reduction in the related liability for contingent consideration).\n\nIn  January  2020,  Merck  acquired ArQule,  Inc.  (ArQule),  a  publicly  traded  biopharmaceutical  company  focused  on kinase inhibitor discovery and development for the treatment of patients with cancer and other diseases. Total consideration paid of $2.7 billion included $138 million of share-based compensation payments to settle equity awards attributable to precombination service and cash paid for transaction costs on behalf of ArQule. The Company incurred $95 million of costs directly related to the acquisition  of  ArQule,  consisting  almost  entirely  of  share-based  compensation  payments  to  settle  non-vested  equity  awards attributable  to  postcombination  service.  These  costs  were  included  in Selling,  general  and  administrative expenses  in  2020. ArQule's  lead  investigational  candidate,  nemtabrutinib  (MK-1026),  is  a  novel,  oral  Bruton's  tyrosine  kinase  (BTK)  inhibitor currently being evaluated for the treatment of B-cell malignancies. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination.\n\nThe estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed from ArQule is as follows:\n\n",

Research and development expenses in 2021 reflect higher clinical development spending and increased investment in discovery research and early drug development.\n\nIn November 2021, Merck's Board of Directors approved an increase to the Company's quarterly dividend, raising it to $0.69  per  share  from  $0.65  per  share  on  the  Company's  outstanding  common  stock.  During  2021,  the  Company  returned  $7.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\n\nIn December 2021, the Company completed its inaugural issuance of a $1.0 billion sustainability bond, which was part of an $8.0 billion underwritten bond offering. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the sustainability bond offering to support projects and partnerships in the Company's priority environmental, social and governance (ESG) areas and contribute to the advancement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n## COVID-19 Update\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic Merck has remained focused on protecting the safety of its employees, ensuring that its  supply  of  medicines  and  vaccines  reaches  its  patients,  contributing  its  scientific  expertise  to  the  development  of  an  antiviral therapy, supporting efforts to expand manufacturing capacity and supply of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 medicines and vaccines (see below),  and  supporting  health  care  providers  and  Merck's  communities.  Although  COVID-19-related  disruptions  negatively affected results in 2021 and 2020, Merck continues to experience strong global underlying demand across its business.\n\nIn  2021,  Merck's  sales  were  unfavorably  affected  by  COVID-19-related  disruptions,  which  resulted  in  an  estimated negative impact to Merck's Pharmaceutical segment sales of approximately $1.3 billion. Roughly 75% of Merck's Pharmaceutical segment revenue is comprised of physician-administered products, which, despite strong underlying demand, have been affected by social  distancing measures and fewer well visits. Merck's sales were favorably affected by the authorization of molnupiravir in several markets as discussed further below, which resulted in sales of $952 million in 2021. In 2020, the estimated negative impact of  COVID-19-related  disruptions  to  Merck's  sales  was  approximately  $2.1  billion,  of  which  approximately  $2.0  billion  was attributable to the Pharmaceutical segment and approximately $50 million was attributable to the Animal Health segment.\n\nIn April 2021, Merck announced it was discontinuing the development of MK-7110 (formerly known as CD24Fc) for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, which was obtained as part of Merck's acquisition of OncoImmune (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). This decision resulted in charges of $207 million to Cost of sales in  2021.  In January 2021, the Company announced the discontinuation of the development programs for its COVID-19 vaccine candidates, V590 and V591, following Merck's review of findings from Phase 1 clinical studies for the vaccines. In these studies, both V590 and V591 were generally well tolerated, but the immune responses were inferior to those seen following natural infection and those reported for other SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 vaccines. Due to the discontinuation, the Company recorded a charge of $305 million in 2020, of which $260 million was reflected in Cost of sales and the remaining $45 million of costs were reflected in Research and development expenses.\n\nOperating expenses reflect a minor positive effect in 2021 as investments in COVID-19-related research largely offset the favorable impact of lower spending in other areas due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Operating expenses were positively affected in  2020  by  approximately  $500  million  primarily  due  to  lower  promotional  and  selling  costs,  as  well  as  lower  research  and development expenses, net of investments in COVID-19-related antiviral and vaccine research programs. In addition, the COVID19 pandemic has caused some disruption and volatility in the Company's global supply chain network, and the Company may in the future experience disruptions in availability and delays in shipments of raw materials and packaging, as well as related cost inflation.\n\nIn  December 2021, the FDA granted EUA for molnupiravir based on positive results from the Phase 3 MOVe-OUT clinical trial.

The  withdrawal  of  this  indication  was  done  in  consultation  with  the  FDA  and  does  not  affect  other indications for Keytruda . As announced in January 2020, KEYNOTE-604, the confirmatory Phase 3 trial for this indication, met one  of  its  dual  primary  endpoints  of  progression-free  survival  but  did  not  reach  statistical  significance  for  the  other  primary endpoint of overall survival.\n\nIn 2022, Merck initiated the withdrawal of the U.S. accelerated approval indication for Keytruda for  the treatment of patients with recurrent locally advanced or metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma whose tumors express PD-L1, with disease progression on or after two or more prior lines of therapy. The decision was made in consultation with the FDA following the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee evaluation of this third-line gastric cancer indication for Keytruda as a monotherapy because it failed to meet its post-marketing requirement of demonstrating an overall survival benefit in a Phase 3 study. The withdrawal of this indication does not affect other indications for Keytruda .\n\nThe Company is a party to certain third-party license agreements pursuant to which the Company pays royalties on sales of Keytruda .  Under the terms of the more significant of these agreements, Merck pays a royalty of 6.5% on worldwide sales of Keytruda through 2023 to one third party; this royalty will decline to 2.5% for 2024 through 2026 and will terminate thereafter. The Company pays an additional 2% royalty on worldwide sales of Keytruda to another third party, the termination date of which varies by country; this royalty will expire in the U.S. in 2024 and in major European markets in 2025. The royalties are included in Cost of sales .\n\nLynparza is an oral poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor being developed as part of a collaboration with AstraZeneca  (see  Note  5  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements).

Alliance revenue related to Lynparza grew 36% in 2021 and 63% in 2020 due to continued uptake across the multiple approved indications in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China. In June 2021, Lynparza was granted conditional approval in China as monotherapy for the treatment of certain previously treated adult patients with germline or somatic BRCA -mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer based on the results of the PROfound trial.\n\nLenvima is an oral receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor being developed as part of a collaboration with Eisai (see Note 5 to the  consolidated  financial  statements).

      "question": "How does Merck's collaboration with Eisai on Lenvima, specifically through the LEAP clinical program, influence Merck's pharmaceutical segment revenue, given the current status of key trials and alliance revenue model?",
      "answer": "Merck's collaboration with Eisai on Lenvima through the LEAP clinical program influences its pharmaceutical segment revenue by shaping the future commercial potential of the Keytruda plus Lenvima combination across multiple tumor types. Although the FDA issued a CRL for the first-line treatment of unresectable HCC based on the KEYNOTE-524/Study 116 trial, Merck and Eisai are conducting the Phase 3 LEAP-002 trial to demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness. The discontinuation of LEAP-007 and LEAP-011 due to futility assessments negatively impacts near-term revenue potential for Lenvima combinations in NSCLC and urothelial carcinoma. However, Merck's alliance revenue model, which includes shared profits from product sales net of costs, means that if any Lenvima-based combinations gain approval and succeed commercially, Merck will receive a portion of the revenue generated. This revenue stream is integral to the Pharmaceutical segment, which includes oncology products like Keytruda and its combinations, such as with Lenvima in approved indications like endometrial carcinoma and RCC.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Lenvima is being studied with Keytruda in the LEAP clinical program across 14 tumor types, including ongoing LEAP-002 for HCC and discontinued LEAP-007 and LEAP-011 due to futility.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Merck's Pharmaceutical segment includes oncology products such as Keytruda and Lenvima combinations, and alliance revenue represents Merck's share of profits from product sales net of cost of sales and commercialization costs.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The success or failure of Lenvima-based combinations in clinical trials directly affects the future revenue potential under Merck's alliance revenue model, which is a key component of the Pharmaceutical segment's financial performance."

Lynparza is also under review in the EU for the treatment of certain patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer based on the PROpel clinical trial.\n\nMK-7902, Lenvima, is an oral receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor being developed as part of a collaboration with Eisai Co.,  Ltd.  (Eisai).  Merck  and  Eisai  are  studying  the Keytruda plus  Lenvima  combination  through  the  LEAP  (LEnvatinib And Pembrolizumab)  clinical  program  that  includes  17  Phase  3  studies  across  14  different  tumor  types  (biliary  cancer,  CRC, endometrial  carcinoma,  esophageal  cancer,  gastric  cancer,  glioblastoma,  HCC,  HNSCC,  melanoma,  pancreatic  cancer,  prostate cancer, NSCLC, SCLC and RCC).\n\nIn July 2020, Merck and Eisai announced that the FDA issued a CRL regarding Merck's and Eisai's applications seeking accelerated approval for the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable HCC based on the KEYNOTE-524/Study 116 trial. Ahead of  the  PDUFA  action  dates  of  Merck's  and  Eisai's  applications,  another  combination  therapy  was  approved  based  on  a randomized, controlled trial that demonstrated improvement in overall survival versus standard-of-care treatment. Consequently, the  CRL  stated  that  Merck's  and  Eisai's  applications  do  not  provide  evidence  that Keytruda in  combination  with  Lenvima represents  a  meaningful  advantage  over  available  therapies  for  the  treatment  of  unresectable  or  metastatic  HCC  with  no  prior systemic  therapy  for  advanced  disease.  Since  the  applications  for  KEYNOTE-524/Study  116  no  longer  meet  the  criteria  for accelerated approval, both companies plan to work with the FDA to take appropriate next steps, which include conducting a wellcontrolled clinical trial that demonstrates substantial evidence of effectiveness and the clinical benefit of the combination. As such, LEAP-002, the Phase 3 trial evaluating the Keytruda plus  Lenvima  combination as a first-line  treatment  for  advanced  HCC,  is currently underway and fully enrolled. The CRL does not impact the current approved indications for Keytruda or for Lenvima.\n\nMerck  and  Eisai  have  stopped  LEAP-007,  the  Phase  3  study  evaluating  the  first-line  treatment  of  Lenvima  in combination with Keytruda in participants with metastatic squamous or non-squamous NSCLC, whose tumors are PD-L1 positive with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. The trial has been discontinued following the recommendation of the external Data Monitoring Committee (eDMC) which met, as scheduled, to assess safety and futility. The eDMC determined that the study had met the criteria for declaring futility and the benefit/risk profile of the combination did not support continuing the trial.\n\nMerck and Eisai have closed LEAP-011 for further enrollment. LEAP-011 is a Phase 3 study evaluating Lenvima in combination with Keytruda for the first-line treatments of patients with platinum-ineligible urothelial carcinoma. Enrollment was closed following the recommendation of the eDMC, which met, as scheduled, to assess safety and futility. The eDMC determined that the benefit/risk profile of the combination did not support continuing the trial and improvements in outcomes in favor of the combination were unlikely to be as high as initially hypothesized.\n\nThe Company also has several other programs in Phase 3 clinical development.\n\nMK-1308A  is  the  coformulation of quavonlimab, Merck's novel investigational anti-CTLA-4  antibody, with pembrolizumab being evaluated for the treatment of RCC.\n\nSubcutaneous  MK-3475,  pembrolizumab,  is  being  evaluated  for  comparability  with  the  intravenous  formulation  in NSCLC.\n\nMK-4280A is the coformulation of favezelimab, Merck's novel investigational anti-LAG3 therapy, with pembrolizumab, being evaluated for the treatment of CRC.\n\nMK-6482, Welireg (belzutifan), is a hypoxia-inducible factor-2\u03b1 (HIF-2\u03b1) inhibitor being evaluated for a supplemental indication for the treatment of patients with RCC.\n\nMK-7119,  Tukysa,  is  a  small  molecule  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor,  for  the  treatment  of  HER2-positive  cancers  in development for the treatment of breast cancer. In September 2020, Seagen granted Merck an exclusive license and entered into a co-development agreement with Merck to accelerate the global reach of Tukysa.\n\nMK-7684A is the coformulation of vibostolimab, an anti-TIGIT therapy, with pembrolizumab being evaluated for the treatment of NSCLC.\n\nIn  December  2021,  Merck  announced  that  the  FDA  had  placed  clinical  holds  on  the  investigational  new  drug applications for the oral and implant formulations of islatravir (MK-8591) for HIV-1 pre-exposure prophylaxis",

(AbbVie or the company) is the discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of a broad line of therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases. AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain products (i ncluding aesthetic products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies, patients or other customers.

The notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of AbbVie and will rank equally in right of payment with all of AbbVie's existing and future unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness, liabilities and other obligations. AbbVie may redeem the fixed-rate senior notes prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of the principal amount or the sum of present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the fi xed-rate senior notes to be redeemed plus a make-whole premium. AbbVie may also redeem the fixed-rate senior notes at par between one and six months prior to maturity. In connection with the offering, debt issuance costs incurred totaled $99 million and debt discounts totaled $37 million, which are being amortized over the respective terms of the notes to interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings.\n\nAbbVie used the net proceeds received from the issuance of the notes to finance the acquisition of ImmunoGen, repay its term-loan, repay commercial paper borrowings, pay fees and expenses in respect of the foregoing, finance general corporate purposes and, together with cash on hand, fund AbbVie's acquisition of Cerevel Therapeutics. See Note 5 for additional information.\n\nIn December 2023, AbbVie entered into a $9.0 billion 364-day bridge credit agreement and $5.0 billion 364-day term loan credit agreement. In February 2024, AbbVie borrowed and repaid $5.0 billion under the term loan credit agreement. Interest charged on this borrowing was based on Secured Overnight Financing Rate Reference Rate (SOFR) +0.975% with an effective interest rate of 6.29%. Subsequent to the $15.0 billion issuance of senior notes, AbbVie terminated both the bridge and term loan credit agreements in the first quarter of 2024. In February 2024, concurrent with the ImmunoGen acquisition, the company assumed and repaid an ImmunoGen senior secured term loan at a fair value of $99 million.\n\nIn connection with the acquisition of Cerevel Therapeutics, the company assumed $345 million aggregate principal of 2.5% convertible senior notes due 2027. Upon acquisition, the convertible senior notes became callable and note holders could redeem the convertible senior notes for cash at a premium. As of the acquisition date, the convertible senior notes were recognized as current portion of long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets at an aggregate fair value of $400 million. Following the acquisition date, the company repaid the convertible senior notes and there were no amounts outstanding as of December 31, 2024.\n\nThe company also assumed funding agreements entered into by Cerevel Therapeutics prior to the acquisition. Under the agreements, Cerevel Therapeutics received funding to support development of tavapadon and agreed to repay regulatory milestones, sales milestones and royalties contingent upon approval of tavapadon by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In addition, upon acquisition the company has the option to satisfy payment obligations early by making a payment equal to the amount of funding provided to Cerevel Therapeutics plus a variable premium. In all circumstances, total repayments under the funding agreements will not exceed $531 million in aggregate. The funding agreements were accounted for as financing arrangements and the fair value of the related financing liability was $246 million as of the acquisition date. In conjunction with the funding agreements, AbbVie also assumed security agreements entered into by\n\n2024 Form 10-K\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "\nIntangible assets relate to $8.1 billion of acquired in-process research and development (IPR&amp;D) associated with products that have not yet received regulatory approval. The estimated fair values of identifiable intangible assets were determined using the \"income approach\" which is a valuation technique that provides an estimate of the fair value of an asset based on market participant expectations of the cash flows an asset would generate over its remaining useful l i fe. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of these asset valuations include the estimated net cash flows for each year for each asset or product, the appropriate discount rate necessary to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the life cycle of each asset, the potential regulatory and commercial success risk, competitive trends impacting the asset and each cash flow stream, as well as other factors.\n\nThe current portion of long-term debt assumed by AbbVie consists of $345 million aggregate principal of 2.5% convertible senior notes due 2027. Upon acquisition, the convertible senior notes became callable and note holders could redeem the convertible senior notes for cash at a premium. As of the acquisition date, the convertible senior notes were recognized as current portion of long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets at an aggregate fair value of $400 million. Following the acquisition date, the company repaid the convertible senior notes and there were no amounts outstanding as of December 31, 2024.\n\nLong-term debt assumed by AbbVie relates to funding agreements entered into by Cerevel Therapeutics prior to the acquisition. Under the agreements, Cerevel Therapeutics received funding to support development of tavapadon and agreed to repay regulatory milestones, sales milestones and royalties contingent upon approval of tavapadon by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The funding agreements were accounted for as financing arrangements and the fair value of the related financing liability was $246 million as of the acquisition date. The estimated fair value of the financing liability was determined using a probability-weighted expected payment model for regulatory milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for sales milestones and royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Assumptions inherent in the development of fair value include discount rates, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving milestones and estimated amounts of future sales. See Note 10 and Note 11 for additional information.\n\nGoodwill was calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Specifically, the goodwill recognized from the acquisition of Cerevel Therapeutics represents expected synergies, including the ability to: (i) expand AbbVie's neuroscience pipeline, (ii) leverage AbbVie's commercial, regulatory and clinical expertise to maximize Cerevel Therapeutic's assets and (iii) enhance AbbVie's existing neuroscience discovery capabilities. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.\n\n2024 Form 10-K\n\n",

        "Step 4: Synthesize - Calculate the total growth percentage of ERLEADA from 2021 to 2023: ((2,387 - 1,291) / 1,291) * 100 = 84.9%. Then, assess its contribution to the Oncology segment's overall performance, noting that ERLEADA's 26.9% growth was above the segment average and among the top contributors."

      "question": "Given the expiration timeline of the STELARA patents and the revenue contribution of STELARA in fiscal 2023, how much revenue protection does Johnson & Johnson anticipate in the U.S. before potential biosimilar competition, based on the delay secured through settlements?",
      "answer": "Johnson & Johnson anticipates revenue protection for STELARA in the U.S. until at least January 1, 2025, despite the latest expiring U.S. composition-of-matter patent having expired in 2023. This delay in biosimilar competition secures an additional 2 years of potential exclusivity, during which STELARA\u2014responsible for 12.8% of total company revenues in fiscal 2023\u2014can continue to generate revenue without biosimilar competition.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - STELARA accounted for approximately 12.8% of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s total revenues in fiscal 2023.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The latest expiring U.S. composition-of-matter patent for STELARA expired in 2023.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Despite the 2023 patent expiration, settlements with third parties delay biosimilar launch until January 1, 2025, providing continued revenue protection for STELARA.",
        "Step 4: Calculate implication - This 2-year delay (2023\u20132025) allows Johnson & Johnson to maintain STELARA\u2019s 12.8% revenue contribution without biosimilar competition in the U.S. market."

      "question": "What is the total worldwide sales decline percentage of XARELTO from 2022 to 2023, and how does this decline compare to the overall change in JNJ's Cardiovascular / Metabolism / Other segment during the same period?",
      "answer": "The worldwide sales of XARELTO declined by 4.4% from 2022 to 2023. This decline is less severe than the overall 5.5% decline in JNJ's Cardiovascular / Metabolism / Other segment during the same period. Therefore, XARELTO performed relatively better compared to the broader segment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The worldwide sales of XARELTO in 2023 and 2022 are $2,365 million and $2,473 million, respectively, showing a 4.4% decline.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The total Cardiovascular / Metabolism / Other segment experienced a 5.5% decline in sales from 2022 to 2023.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Comparing the 4.4% decline in XARELTO sales to the broader segment's 5.5% decline indicates that XARELTO outperformed the overall segment."

      "answer": "The fair value of Medtronic's auction rate securities remained unchanged at $33 million from April 30, 2021, to April 29, 2022. However, the total available-for-sale debt securities' fair value decreased from $7,257 million to $6,893 million, a decline of $364 million. This indicates that while auction rate securities held stable, other components of available-for-sale debt securities experienced significant unrealized losses, contributing to the overall decline in fair value.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - The fair value of auction rate securities was $33 million as of April 30, 2021.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - The fair value of auction rate securities remained at $33 million as of April 29, 2022.",
        "Step 3: Extract from source A - Total available-for-sale debt securities had a fair value of $7,257 million as of April 30, 2021.",
        "Step 4: Extract from source B - Total available-for-sale debt securities had a fair value of $6,893 million as of April 29, 2022.",
        "Step 5: Calculate the change in total available-for-sale debt securities: $7,257 million - $6,893 million = $364 million decrease.",
        "Step 6: Synthesize - While auction rate securities remained stable, the overall decline in fair value of available-for-sale debt securities indicates losses in other categories such as corporate debt or mortgage-backed securities."

      "answer": "Medtronic's decision to discontinue the HVAD System in June 2021 removed a product that had generated $141 million in net sales during fiscal year 2021. This discontinuation likely contributed to the company's focus on other growth drivers in fiscal year 2022, such as the Symplicity Spyral Multi-Electrode Renal Denervation Catheter, Pulse Field Ablation, Aurora Extravascular ICD, and transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapy products led by the Intrepid system. Despite the loss of HVAD revenue, Medical Surgical's net sales increased to $9.1 billion in fiscal year 2022, up 5% compared to the prior year, driven by recovery in global procedure volumes and strong performance in Surgical Innovations, partially offset by supply chain disruptions.",

The products include those for advanced and general surgical products, surgical stapling devices, vessel sealing instruments, wound closure, electrosurgery products, hernia mechanical devices, mesh implants, advanced ablation, interventional lung, ventilators, airway products, renal care products, and sensors and monitors for pulse oximetry, capnography, level of consciousness and cerebral oximetry. Medical Surgical's net sales for fiscal year 2022 were $9.1 billion, an increase of 5 percent as compared to fiscal year 2021. Currency had an unfavorable impact on net sales of $44 million for fiscal year 2022. The net sales increase was primarily due to the recovery of global procedure volumes from the declines experienced in fiscal year 2021 partially offset by global supply chain disruptions and declines in China due to recent COVID-19 lockdowns.\n\nThe charts below illustrate the percent of Medical Surgical net sales by division for fiscal years 2022 and 2021:\n\nSurgical Innovations (SI) net sales for fiscal year 2022 increased 11 percent as compared to fiscal year 2021. Net sales growth was led by Advanced Surgical instruments, driven by the continued adoption of the Company's LigaSure, Sonicision, and Tri-Staple technologies, and Hernia and Wound Management. The increase was partially offset by declines in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 resulting from global supply chain challenges, including resins, semiconductors, and packaging trays, which impacted energy and stapling products.\n\nRespiratory, Gastrointestinal, &amp; Renal (RGR) net sales for fiscal year 2022 decreased 7 percent as compared to fiscal year 2021. RGR net sales declines were largely due to declines in ventilator demands when compared fiscal year 2021 as demand returned to pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022. These declines were partially offset by growth in Patient Monitoring, led by the Nellcor pulse oximetry sensors and the Bispectral Index (BIS) sensors, Gastrointestinal, driven by the esophageal product portfolio, as well as growth in Renal Care Solutions.\n\nIn addition to the macro-economic and geopolitical factors described in the Executive Level Overview, looking ahead we expect Medical Surgical could be affected by the following:\n\n- Continued acceptance and future growth of Open-to-MIS techniques and tools supported by our efforts to transition open surgery to MIS (minimally invasive surgery).

The net sales for the Medtronic HVAD system for fiscal year 2021 was $141 million.\n\nStructural Heart &amp; Aortic (SHA) net sales increased 8 percent in fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021. The increase was led by growth in transcatheter  aortic  valve  replacement  (TAVR)  net  sales  as  a  result  of  continued  adoption  of  the  CoreValve  Evolut.  Cardiac Surgery also contributed to the net increase in sales as a result of broad growth across the business, particularly from strong sales of ExtraCorporeal Life Support (ECLS) devices. These increases were partially offset by declines within Aortic caused by field corrective actions (FCA) and COVID-19 challenges. The most notable field corrective actions were for the Valiant Navion Thoracic Stent Graft System FCA issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 and the Endurant II/IIs Stent Graft Systems FCA issued in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022.\n\nCoronary &amp; Peripheral Vascular (CPV) net sales increased 5 percent in fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021. The increase was led  by  growth  in  Peripheral  Vascular  Health  driven  by  strong  performance  of  the  recently  launched Abre  venous  self-expanding  stent system for Deep Venous disease, as well as our superficial venous product portfolio, including the VenaSeal and ClosureFast systems. The increase  was  partially  offset  by  declines  in  Coronary  as  well  as  Atherectomy  products  due  to  impacts  of  COVID-19  on  procedural volumes.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  macro-economic  and  geopolitical  factors  described  in  the  Executive  Level  Overview,  looking  ahead,  we  expect Cardiovascular could be affected by the following:\n\n- Continued growth of our Micra transcatheter pacing system. The Micra AV launched in Japan in November 2021 and received approval  in  China  in  May  2022.  Micra AV  expands  the  Micra  target  population  from  15  percent  to  45  percent  of  pacemaker patients.\n- Continued acceptance and growth from the Azure XT and S SureScan pacing systems. Azure pacemakers feature Medtronicexclusive BlueSync technology, which enables automatic, secure wireless remote monitoring with increased device longevity.\n- Growth of the Cobalt and Crome portfolio of ICDs and CRT-Ds.\n- Continued  acceptance  and  expansion  of  the  Claria  MRI  CRT-D  system  with  AdaptivCRT  and  compatibility  with  TriageHF technology.\n- Continued acceptance and expansion of the LINQ II cardiac monitor. Supply for the LINQ II cardiac monitor is improving as we continue to ramp our wafer scale manufacturing. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, we launched two AccuRhythm AI algorithms on the LINQ II platform to significantly reduce false positive alerts for Atrial Fibrillation and Pause while retaining sensitivity for true positive detection, and reduce clinic workload and burden.\n- Growth of the CRT-P quadripolar pacing system.\n- Continued growth, adoption, and utilization of the TYRX Envelope for implantable devices.\n- Continued acceptance and market expansion of Arctic Front cryoablation for treatment of atrial fibrillation. In June 2021, the Arctic Front cryoablation system received a first line therapy designation from the U.S. FDA for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.\n- Continued acceptance and growth of the self-expanding CoreValve Evolut transcatheter aortic valve replacement platform into intermediate risk indication globally and for the treatment of patients determined to be at low risk with surgery.\n- Continued expansion and training of field support to increase coverage in the U.S. centers performing TAVR procedures.\n- Continued acceptance and growth from Evolut PRO, which provides industry-leading hemodynamics, reliable delivery, enhanced durability versus SAVR procedures at 5 years, and advanced sealing with an excellent safety profile. In August 2021, the U.S. FDA approved  the  Evolut  FX  TAVR,  a  system  enhancement  designed  to  improve  the  overall  procedural  experience  through enhancements in deliverability, implant visibility and deployment stability. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, Evolut PRO received NMPA approval within China.\n- Continued acceptance and growth from the VenaSeal Closure System in the U.S. The VenaSeal Closure System is a unique nonthermal solution to address superficial venous disease that provides improved patient comfort, reduces the recovery time, and eliminates the risk of thermal nerve injury.\n- Continued acceptance and growth of the Abre venous self-expanding stent system in the U.S. as well as pressure from competitors re-entering the market. Abre is designed for the unique challenges of venous disease. It offers easy deployment, to let physicians focus on their patient, and delivers demonstrated endurance, to give patients freedom of movement.\n- Our  voluntary  recall  of  the  Valiant  Navion  Thoracic  Stent  Graft  System  and  our  ability  to  ramp  production  of  our  previous generation product, the Valiant Captivia Thoracic Stent Graft System. We are currently ramping production of the Valiant Captivia Thoracic Stent Graft System and plan to reach full production capacity in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023.",

      "answer": "The U.S. patent expiration year for Hepcludex is 2030, and the E.U. patent expiration year is 2029, resulting in a one-year difference. The Management Overview explicitly states that 'Hepcludex and Jyseleca are not approved in the United States,' indicating that despite being part of Gilead's marketed product portfolio, Hepcludex's financial contribution is limited in the U.S. due to lack of approval, which could affect its overall revenue potential compared to regions where it is approved.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize that the one-year difference in patent protection does not apply in the U.S. due to the lack of approval, meaning the product cannot generate revenue in that market, making the patent expiration distinction largely irrelevant there."

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  OF  FINANCIAL  CONDITION AND  RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe  following  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations  ('MD&amp;A')  is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2020 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'SEC'). Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and are presented in U.S. dollars.\n\n## MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW\n\nGilead  Sciences,  Inc.  ('Gilead,'  'we,'  'our'  or  'us')  is  a  biopharmaceutical  company  that  has  pursued  and  achieved breakthroughs in medicine for more than three decades, with the goal of creating a healthier world for all people. We are committed to  advancing  innovative  medicines  to  prevent  and  treat  life-threatening  diseases,  including  HIV ,  viral  hepatitis  and  cancer.  We operate in more than 35 countries worldwide, with headquarters in Foster City, California.\n\nOur portfolio of marketed products includes AmBisome , Atripla , Biktarvy , Cayston , Complera , Descovy , Descovy for PrEP , Emtriva , Epclusa , Eviplera , Genvoya , Harvoni , Hepcludex (bulevirtide), Hepsera , Jyseleca (filgotinib), Letairis , Odefsey ,  Ranexa ,  Sovaldi ,  Stribild ,  Tecartus ,  Trodelvy ,  Truvada ,  Truvada  for  PrEP ,  Tybost ,  Veklury ,  Vemlidy , Viread ,  V osevi ,  Yescarta and  Zydelig .  The  approval  status  of  Hepcludex  and  Jyseleca  vary  worldwide,  and  Hepcludex  and Jyseleca are not approved in the United States. We also sell and distribute authorized generic versions of Epclusa and Harvoni in the United States through our separate subsidiary, Asegua Therapeutics, LLC. In addition, we sell and distribute certain products through our corporate partners under collaborative agreements. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\n## Business Highlights (1)\n\nWe delivered strong financial performance in 2021. Veklury continued to play a critical role in addressing the coronavirus disease 2019 ('COVID-19') pandemic. Veklury's performance helped mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on other parts of the business, including on our HIV and chronic hepatitis C virus ('HCV') franchises, and the impacts of the October 2020 loss of exclusivity of Truvada and Atripla in the United States. Despite these transitory headwinds, underlying demand for our virology portfolio remained strong, led by the continued growth of our Biktarvy franchise. We also received increased contributions from our oncology franchise, experiencing growth in Trodelvy, as well as our Cell Therapy franchise.",

ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## Overview\n\nGilead  Sciences,  Inc.  ('Gilead,'  'we,'  'our'  or  'us')  is  a  biopharmaceutical  company  that  has  pursued  and  achieved breakthroughs in medicine for more than three decades, with the goal of creating a healthier world for all people. We are committed to  advancing  innovative  medicines  to  prevent  and  treat  life-threatening  diseases,  including  HIV ,  viral  hepatitis  and  cancer.  We operate in more than 35 countries worldwide, with headquarters in Foster City, California.\n\nOur portfolio of marketed products includes AmBisome , Atripla , Biktarvy , Cayston , Complera , Descovy , Descovy for PrEP , Emtriva , Epclusa , Eviplera , Genvoya , Harvoni , Hepcludex (bulevirtide), Hepsera , Jyseleca (filgotinib), Letairis , Odefsey ,  Ranexa ,  Sovaldi ,  Stribild ,  Tecartus ,  Trodelvy ,  Truvada ,  Truvada  for  PrEP ,  Tybost ,  Veklury ,  Vemlidy , Viread ,  V osevi ,  Yescarta and  Zydelig .  The  approval  status  of  Hepcludex  and  Jyseleca  vary  worldwide,  and  Hepcludex  and Jyseleca are not approved in the United States. We also sell and distribute authorized generic versions of Epclusa and Harvoni in the United States through our separate subsidiary, Asegua Therapeutics, LLC. In addition, we sell and distribute certain products through our corporate partners under collaborative agreements. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Gilead, our wholly-owned subsidiaries and certain variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. For consolidated entities where we own or are exposed to less than 100% of the economics, we record net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in our Consolidated Statements of Income equal to the percentage of the economic or ownership interest retained in such entities by the respective noncontrolling parties.\n\nWe assess whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity ('VIE') at the inception of the arrangement and at each reporting date. This assessment is based on our power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and our obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We did not have any material VIEs as of December 31, 2021.\n\nCertain reclassifications have been made to prior periods in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes to conform with the current presentation. Beginning 2020, acquired in-process research and development ('IPR&amp;D') expenses are reported  separately  from  Research  and  development  expenses  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income.  Our  Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was conformed to separately present acquired IPR&amp;D expenses.\n\n## Segment Information\n\nWe have one operating segment which primarily focuses on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative medicines  in  areas  of  unmet  medical  need.  Our  Chief  Executive  Officer,  as  the  chief  operating  decision-maker  ('CODM'), manages and allocates resources to the operations of our company on an entity-wide basis. Managing and allocating resources on an entity-wide basis enables our CODM to assess the overall level of resources available and how to best deploy these resources across  functions  and  research  and  development  ('R&amp;D')  projects  based  on  unmet  medical  need  and,  as  necessary,  reallocate resources among our internal R&amp;D portfolio and external opportunities to best support the long-term growth of our business. See Note 2. Revenues for a summary of disaggregated revenues by product and geographic region.\n\n## Significant Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments\n\nThe preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires  us  to  make  estimates  and  judgments  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets,  liabilities,  revenues  and  expenses  and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our significant accounting policies and estimates. We base our estimates on historical  experience  and  on  various  market-specific  and  other  relevant  assumptions  that  we  believe  to  be  reasonable  under  the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Estimates are assessed each period and updated to reflect current information, such as the economic considerations related to the impact that the coronavirus disease ('COVID-19') could have on our significant accounting estimates. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates.",

The transaction closed in December 2021.\n- In October 2021, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Merck to evaluate the efficacy of  Trodelvy  in  combination  with  Keytruda  as  a  first-line  treatment  for  patients  with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic TNBC.\n- In  September  2021,  Health  Canada  approved  Trodelvy  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  unresectable  locally advanced or metastatic TNBC who have received two or more therapies, at least one of them for metastatic disease. Canada  joined Australia,  Great  Britain,  Switzerland  and  the  United  States  among  the  countries  that  have  approved Trodelvy  for  use  under  Project  Orbis,  a  global  collaborative  review  program  for  high  impact  oncology  marketing applications across participating countries.\n- In  April  2021,  FDA  granted  accelerated  approval  of  Trodelvy  for  use  in  adult  patients  with  locally  advanced  or metastatic urothelial cancer ('UC'), a new indication.\n- In  April  2021,  FDA  granted  full  approval  of  Trodelvy  for  adult  patients  with  unresectable  locally  advanced  or metastatic TNBC.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nWe  announced and discussed these updates in further detail in press releases available on our website at www.gilead.com.

      "answer": "The net milestone capitalization for Jardiance decreased from $156.2 million in 2020 to $136.1 million in 2021, representing a $20.1 million decline. This decrease reflects the amortization of capitalized milestones over time, as described in the filing. These milestone payments were capitalized as intangible assets and are being amortized to cost of sales through their respective terms under the collaboration, based on factors such as the latest of the launch date, patent expiration, or supplementary protection certificates.

      "answer": "The carrying value of AMGN's 6.40% 2039 Notes is $333 million, while the principal amount exchanged for these notes is $133 million. The $200 million difference indicates that AMGN has retired a portion of these notes through exchanges, reducing the outstanding principal while the carrying value on the balance sheet reflects the remaining liability adjusted for accounting treatments such as discounts, premiums, and fair value adjustments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, locate the carrying value of the '6.40% notes due 2039' which is $333 million.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, identify the principal amount exchanged for the '6.40% 2039 Notes', which is $133 million.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the difference between the carrying value and the principal amount exchanged: $333 million - $133 million = $200 million.",
        "Step 4: Interpret the financial implication: the reduction in principal through exchanges suggests an active debt management strategy, where AMGN is reducing its future liabilities."

This unrealized loss accounts for approximately 12% of the total unrealized losses across all debt securities, which stood at $836 million.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, identify the fair value of commercial mortgage-backed securities: $975 million is stated directly.",

        "Step 5: Synthesize the findings to answer the question fully, showing both the fair value and the proportional impact of unrealized losses."

      "answer": "CVS faces significant risks to its brand reputation and financial condition due to potential compliance failures in its participation in government health programs such as Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, Medicaid, and dual eligible plans. If CVS fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations, it could be subject to criminal fines, civil penalties, premium refunds, prohibitions on marketing or enrollment, corrective actions, and termination of contracts. These sanctions could materially affect its ability to participate in these programs, harm its brand and reputation, and negatively impact its operating results, cash flows, and financial condition. Additionally, compliance systems that fail or are deemed inadequate may lead to reputational harm, regulatory actions, litigation, and other penalties such as fines or exclusion from government programs. These outcomes could significantly disrupt CVS's business and financial performance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Risk of sanctions such as criminal fines, civil penalties, and termination of contracts due to compliance failures in government programs.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Potential consequences of compliance system failures, including reputational harm, regulatory actions, litigation, and penalties such as fines or exclusion from government programs.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Compliance failures directly threaten brand reputation and financial condition by jeopardizing participation in critical government programs and exposing the company to costly legal and regulatory repercussions."

      "answer": "The fair value of 'Other short-term interest-bearing securities' increased from $0 on December 31, 2022, to $138 million on December 31, 2023. This increase contributed to a rise in total available-for-sale investments from $4,335 million in 2022 to $10,404 million in 2023, reflecting a significant growth of $6,069 million in the company's short-term investment portfolio.",

      "question": "How does the patent expiration timeline for Prevnar 13 in different regions, as listed in Pfizer's 2024 10-K, relate to the $964 million intangible asset impairment charge for Prevnar 13's developed technology rights recorded in 2023?",
      "answer": "The $964 million intangible asset impairment charge for Prevnar 13's developed technology rights in 2023 was driven by updated commercial forecasts reflecting a transition to vaccines with higher serotype coverage. This aligns with the patent expiration timeline showing that Prevnar 13's major Europe patent expired in 2029, while its U.S. patent expires in 2026. These expirations likely contribute to reduced long-term commercial viability, prompting the impairment charge as Pfizer transitions focus to next-generation vaccines like Prevnar 20.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Prevnar 13's U.S. basic product patent expires in 2026, while its major Europe patent expires in 2029.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - In 2023, Pfizer recorded a $964 million intangible asset impairment charge for Prevnar 13's developed technology rights, citing updated commercial forecasts reflecting a transition to vaccines with higher serotype coverage.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The patent expiration timeline indicates that Prevnar 13 will face increased competition in both the U.S. and Europe within the next few years, reducing its long-term revenue potential. This supports the decision to impair the asset in 2023 as Pfizer shifts focus to next-generation vaccines like Prevnar 20, which has later patent expiration dates."

      "answer": "Pfizer has approximately $1 billion in remaining contracted revenue for Paxlovid expected to be recognized from deliveries between 2025 and 2028. This is significantly higher than the $129 million recognized in 2024 from a one-time sales true-up settlement agreement with a commercialization partner.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir; ritonavir) is listed as a product with a filing status in the U.S. and EU for treating high-risk children with COVID-19, establishing its ongoing development and commercial relevance.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, Pfizer reported approximately $1 billion in remaining performance obligations for Paxlovid as of December 31, 2024, expected to be delivered between 2025 and 2028.",
        "Step 3: From evidence_source_b, in 2024, Pfizer recognized $129 million related to a one-time sales true-up settlement agreement with a commercialization partner, which was a discrete revenue event unrelated to the long-term contracted revenue for Paxlovid.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize: Comparing the $1 billion in future contracted revenue for Paxlovid with the $129 million one-time settlement shows the relative scale of ongoing commercial commitments versus one-time adjustments."

      "question": "How might the ongoing patent litigation over Comirnaty impact Pfizer's 2025 revenue projections, given the vaccine's transition to commercial markets and its revenue concentration in the second half of the year?",
      "answer": "The ongoing patent litigation over Comirnaty, including lawsuits from GSK Group alleging infringement of eight U.S. patents and Promosome LLC asserting infringement of a European patent in France, Germany, and Sweden, poses legal and financial risks that could disrupt Pfizer's commercialization plans. Given that Comirnaty's global revenues in 2024 were primarily concentrated in the fourth quarter and the company expects a similar revenue phasing pattern in 2025, any legal setbacks or damages awarded could materially impact Pfizer\u2019s financial performance. This is especially significant as Comirnaty transitions from government contracts to traditional commercial market sales, increasing its exposure to market dynamics and legal challenges.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Comirnaty's global revenues in 2024 were primarily recorded in the fourth quarter, with a similar revenue phasing expected in 2025 due to the transition to commercial markets.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Comirnaty is the subject of multiple patent infringement lawsuits from GSK Group (eight U.S. patents) and Promosome LLC (European patent in France, Germany, and Sweden), seeking unspecified monetary damages.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The timing and concentration of Comirnaty's revenue in the second half of the year increases its vulnerability to legal disruptions. If the patent litigation results in adverse rulings, such as damages or restrictions on commercialization, Pfizer\u2019s 2025 revenue projections for Comirnaty could be significantly affected, especially in key international markets."

Business --Pricing Pressures and Managed Care Organizations and --Government Regulation and Price Constraints and the Item 1A. Risk Factors --Pricing and Reimbursement sections.\n\nImpact of the July 2023 Tornado in Rocky Mount, North Carolina (NC)-Our m anufacturing facility in R ocky M ount, N C  was dam aged by a tornado in July 2023. T he facility is a key producer of sterile injectables and is responsible for m anufacturing nearly 25 percent of all our sterile injectables-including anesthesia, analgesia, and m icronutrients. Supply of medicines has recovered from  the im pact of the tornado. W e incurred losses in 2023 and 2024 that were partially offset by insurance recoveries received.\n\nProduct Supply-We periodically encounter supply delays, disruptions and shortages, including due to voluntary product recalls and natural or m an-m ade disasters. In response to requests from  various regulatory authorities, m anufacturers across the pharm aceutical industry, including P fizer, are evaluating their product portfolios for the potential presence or form ation of nitrosam ines and we are actively engaging with regulatory authorities on this topic. If nitrosam ines are detected above certain levels in our products, this m ay lead to market action for such products. For exam ple, in 2021, P fizer recalled all lots of C hantix due to the presence of a nitrosam ine, N -nitroso-varenicline, at or above acceptable intake lim its communicated by various regulatory authorities. R egulatory authorities have since issued updated guidance on nitrosam ine acceptable intake levels. W ith this guidance, which included an updated intake level for N -nitroso-varenicline, we have started m aking regulatory subm issions to potentially enable C hantix to return to m arket in the U .S. and in certain international m arkets.\n\nExcept for the im pact of the tornado in R ocky M ount, N C  discussed above, we have not seen a significant disruption of our supply chain in 2024 and through the date of filing of this Form  10-K, and all of our m anufacturing sites globally have continued to operate at or near norm al levels. W e do not anticipate the availability of raw m aterials to have a significant im pact on our operations in 2025, but are m onitoring potential supply chain disruptions as a result of ongoing geopolitical and trade negotiations, which could, am ong other things, im pact costs. W e are continuing to m onitor and im plem ent m itigation strategies to reduce any potential risk or im pact including active supplier m anagem ent, qualification of additional suppliers and advanced purchasing to the extent possible. For inform ation on risks related to product m anufacturing, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors--Product Manufacturing, Sales and Marketing Risks section.\n\nVoluntary Withdraw al of Oxbryta-See the Product Developments section within M D &amp;A.\n\nThe G lobal E conomic E nvironment --In addition to the industry-specific factors discussed above, we, like other businesses of our size and global extent of activities, are exposed to econom ic cycles. C ertain factors in the global econom ic environm ent that m ay im pact our global operations include, am ong other things, currency and interest rate fluctuations, capital and exchange controls, local and global econom ic conditions including inflation, recession, volatility and/or lack of liquidity in capital m arkets, expropriation and other restrictive governm ent actions, changes in intellectual property, legal protections and rem edies, trade regulations, tariffs, tax laws and regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, and m arketing of, reim bursem ent for and access to our products, as well as im pacts of political or civil unrest or m ilitary action, including the ongoing conflicts between R ussia and U kraine and in the M iddle E ast and their econom ic consequences, geopolitical instability, terrorist activity, unstable governm ents and legal system s, inter-governm ental disputes, public health outbreaks, epidem ics, pandem ics, natural disasters or disruptions related to clim ate change. G overnm ent pressures can lead to negative pricing pressure in various m arkets where governm ents take an active role in setting prices, access criteria or other m eans of cost control. In addition, issued or future executive orders or other new or changes in laws, regulations or policy regarding tariffs, could have a m aterial adverse effect on our business, earnings and financial guidance. T he actual im pact of the new tariffs on our business is subject to a num ber of factors including, but not lim ited to, restrictions on trade, the effective date and duration of such tariffs, countries included in the scope of tariffs, changes to am ounts of tariffs, and potential retaliatory tariffs im posed by other countries. W e are evaluating opportunities and developing plans which m ay help m itigate the potential im pact of tariffs on our business and operations. F or additional inform ation on risks related to our global operations and changes in laws, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors-Global Operations and -Changes in Law s and Accounting Standards sections.\n\nCOVID-19 --In response to C O VID -19, we developed P axlovid and collaborated with BioN T ech to jointly develop C om irnaty. As part of our strategy for C O VID -19, we are continuing to m ake significant investm ents in breakthrough science. T his includes continuing to evaluate C om irnaty and P axlovid, including against new variants of concern, developing variant adapted vaccine candidates and developing potential com bination respiratory vaccines and potential next generation vaccines and therapies. W e are also evaluating P axlovid for certain pediatric patients. See the Product Developments section within M D &amp;A.\n\nI n 2023, we principally sold C om irnaty globally under governm ent contracts. In Septem ber 2023, C om irnaty transitioned to traditional com m ercial m arket sales in the U .S., triggered by the expiration of contracts and the C O VID -19 vaccines from  P fizer and BioN T ech purchased through them  becom ing either depleted or not used following the introduction of a new variant vaccine. Internationally, sales of C om irnaty in international developed m arkets were generally under governm ent contracts in 2023 and 2024, and in em erging m arkets, under a combination of private channels and governm ent contracts; in both cases, we started transitioning to com m ercial m arkets in 2024. D ue to the com m ercial m arket transition as well as the seasonality of dem and for C O VID -19 vaccinations, the m ajority of our global revenues for C om irnaty were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2024. In 2025, for C om irnaty we expect vaccination rates and m arket share in com m ercial m arkets and revenue phasing sim ilar to 2024, prim arily concentrated in the second-half of the year. W e have assum ed no material U .S. policy changes for our vaccines portfolio in 2025 for purposes of our financial guidance, but see Item 1A. Risk Factors-U .S. Healthcare Regulati on for a description of risks and uncertainties that could im pact revenue from  our portfolio of vaccines.\n\nI n 2023, we principally sold P axlovid globally to governm ent agencies. O n O ctober 13, 2023, we announced an am ended agreem ent with the U .S. governm ent, which facilitated the transition of P axlovid to traditional com m ercial m arkets in the U .S. in N ovem ber 2023, with m inim al uptake of N D A-labeled com m ercial product before January 1, 2024 (see Note 17C ). I nternationally, for P axlovid, m ost m arkets have now transitioned to com m ercial m arkets, and we are expecting m ost revenue for P axlovid to be generated through com m ercial channels. In 2025, we expect utilization for P axlovid to follow infection rates and stable m arket share, and revenues m ay fluctuate based on the tim ing, duration and severity of COVID-19 cases.\n\nFor inform ation on risks associated with our C O VID -19 products, as well as C O VID -19 intellectual property disputes, see the Item 1A.

      "answer": "As of December 31, 2024, the remaining contracted revenue for the supply of Paxlovid and Comirnaty totaled approximately $1 billion and $4 billion, respectively, amounting to $5 billion in total. This figure is directly connected to the revenue reversal of $3.5 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023 for Paxlovid, which was partially reversed in the first quarter of 2024 by $771 million due to fewer-than-expected treatment courses (5.1 million vs. 6.5 million) being returned by the U.S. government. Thus, the remaining performance obligations reflect the ongoing contractual expectations despite the earlier revenue reversal and adjustment tied to Paxlovid.",

Additionally, a $3.5 billion non-cash revenue reversal was recorded in Q4 2023 for expected returns of Paxlovid, later adjusted downward by $771 million in Q1 2024 due to fewer returns (5.1 million vs. 6.5 million treatment courses).",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The remaining contracted revenue of $5 billion for Paxlovid and Comirnaty must be understood in the context of the earlier revenue reversal and its subsequent adjustment, showing how contractual expectations persist despite past financial reversals."

The products sold in the international business include those developed in the U.S. and by subsidiaries abroad.\n\nInvestments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties.\n\n## Raw materials\n\nRaw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where there are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company.\n\n## Patents\n\nThe Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible. They own, or are licensed under, a significant number of patents in the U.S. and other countries relating to their products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. The Company's subsidiaries face patent challenges from third parties, including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products.

          "chunk_text": "70% was used in the fair value calculation to reflect inherent regulatory and commercial risk of the IPR&amp;D. The discount rate applied was approximately 17%. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. A cquisition related costs before tax for the fiscal y ear 2024 were not material.\n\nDuring the fiscal year 2023, the Company did not make any acquisitions that qualified as a business combination.\n\nDuring the fiscal year 2022, certain businesses were acquired for $17.7 billion, net of cash acquired. The fiscal year 2022 acquisitions primarily included Abiomed, Inc. (A biomed). The remaining acquisitions were not material.\n\nOn December 22, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Abiomed, a leading, first-to-market provider of cardiovascular medical technology with a firstin-kind portfolio for the treatment of coronary artery disease and heart failure which also has an extensive innovation pipeline of life-saving technologies. The transaction broadens the Company's position as a growing cardiovascular innovator, advancing the standard of care in heart failure and recovery, one of healthcare's largest areas of unmet need. The results of operations were included in the M edTech segment as of the date of the acquisition. The acquisition was completed through a tender offer for all outstanding shares. The consideration paid in the acquisition consisted of an upfront payment of $380.00 per share in cash, amounting to $17.1 billion, net of cash acquired, as well as a non-tradeable contingent value right ('CV R') entitling the holder to receive up to $35.00 per share in cash (which with respect to the CV Rs total approximately $1.6 billion in the aggregate) if certain commercial and clinical milestones are achieved. The corresponding enterprise value (without taking into account the CV Rs) of approximately $16.5 billion includes cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities acquired.\n\n## The milestones of the CVR consist of:\n\n- a. $17.50 per share, payable if net sales for A biomed products exceeds $3.7 billion during Johnson &amp; Johnson's fiscal second quarter of 2027 through fiscal first quarter of 2028, or if this threshold is not met during this period and is subsequently met during any rolling four quarter period up to the end of Johnson &amp; Johnson's fiscal first quarter of 2029, $8.75 per share;\n- b. $7.50 per share payable upon FDA premarket application approval of the use of Impella\u00ae products in ST-elevated myocardial infarction (STEM I) patients without cardiogenic shock by January 1, 2028; and\n- c. $10.00 per share payable upon the first publication of a Class I recommendation for the use of Impella\u00ae products in high risk PCI or STEM I with or without cardiogenic shock within four years from their respective clinical endpoint publication dates, but in all cases no later than December 31, 2029.\n\nDuring the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation. In fiscal 2023, there were purchase price allocation adjustments netting to approximately $0.2 billion with an offsetting increase to goodwill. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated to assets acquired of $20.1 billion (net of $0.3 billion cash acquired), primarily to goodwill for $11.1 billion, amortizable intangible assets for $6.6 billion, IPR&amp;D for $1.1 billion, marketable securities of $0.6 billion and liabilities assumed of $3.0 billion, which includes the fair value of the contingent consideration mentioned above for $0.7 billion and deferred taxes of $2.0 billion. The goodwill is primarily attributable to the commercial acceleration and expansion of the portfolio and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The contingent consideration was recorded in Other Liabilities and adjusted to fair value through the fiscal year end 2024 on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nThe amortizable intangible assets were primarily comprised of already in-market products of the Impella\u00ae platform with an average weighted life of 14 years. The IPR&amp;D assets were valued for technology programs for unapproved products. The value of the IPR&amp;D was calculated using probability-adjusted cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. The probability of success factor ranged from 52% to 70%. The discount rate applied was 9.5%.\n\nIn the fiscal y ears 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded acquisition related costs before tax of approximately $0.3 billion, $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion, which was primarily recorded in Other (income)/expense.\n\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP standards related to business combinations, and goodwill and other intangible assets, supplemental pro forma information for fiscal y ears 2024, 2023 and 2022 is not provided, as the impact of the aforementioned acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations.\n\n92",

      "answer": "The expanded FDA approval of Vemlidy for chronic HBV treatment in pediatric patients aged six years and older, who weigh at least 25 kg, significantly broadens Gilead's market reach in liver disease. Previously, Vemlidy was approved for adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older. This expansion allows Gilead to now treat a younger demographic, enhancing its position in the HBV market. Additionally, Vemlidy complements Gilead\u2019s existing liver disease portfolio, which includes Viread (approved for patients 2 years and older) and Epclusa and Harvoni (approved for HCV in patients 3 years and older). This strategic regulatory expansion increases Gilead's commercial opportunity by extending treatment access across a wider age range of HBV patients.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, Vemlidy is described as an oral formulation of TAF dosed once daily for the treatment of chronic HBV in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older with compensated liver disease.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, Vemlidy received FDA approval for an expanded indication to include pediatric patients six years and older who weigh at least 25 kg.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The expanded indication in evidence_source_b builds on the existing patient population defined in evidence_source_a, now including younger pediatric patients. This increases Gilead\u2019s market potential by extending the eligible patient base for Vemlidy, which is a key product in its liver disease portfolio."

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\n\n## Fortive Corporation Separation\n\nOn July 2, 2016, the Company completed the separation of its former Test &amp; Measurement segment, Industrial Technologies segment (excluding the product identification businesses) and retail/commercial petroleum business by distributing to Danaher stockholders on a pro rata basis all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Fortive Corporation ('Fortive'), the entity the Company incorporated to hold such businesses. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $86 million related to the release of previously provided reserves associated with uncertain tax positions on certain of the Company's tax returns which were jointly filed with Fortive entities. These reserves were released due to the expiration of statutes of limitations for those returns. This income tax benefit is included in earnings from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\n\n## Envista Holdings Corporation Disposition\n\nOn September 20, 2019, Envista Holdings Corporation ('Envista'), completed an initial public offering ('IPO') of 30.8 million shares of its common stock, which represented 19.4% of Envista's outstanding shares at the time of the offering, at a public offering price of $22.00 per share. Envista realized net proceeds of $643 million from the IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and deal expenses.\n\nIn connection with the completion of the IPO, through a series of equity and other transactions, the Company transferred its dental businesses to Envista (the 'Separation'). In exchange, Envista transferred consideration of approximately $2.0 billion to the Company, which consists primarily of the net proceeds from the IPO and approximately $1.3 billion of proceeds from Envista's term debt financing. The excess of the net book value of the business transferred to Envista over the net proceeds from the IPO was $60 million and was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nOn December 18, 2019, Danaher completed the disposition of the remaining 80.6% ownership of Envista common stock through a split-off exchange offer, which resulted in Danaher's repurchase of 22.9 million shares of the Company's common stock in exchange for the remaining shares of Envista held by Danaher (the 'Split-Off'). The IPO, Separation and Split-Off are collectively referred to as the 'Envista Disposition'. As a result, the Company recognized a gain on the disposition of $451 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. At the time of the disposition, the Company reclassified $109 million of foreign currency translation adjustment losses related to Envista from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to the Company's results of discontinued operations as a component of the net gain on the Envista Disposition. As a result of the IPO, Danaher recorded an increase to noncontrolling interest of $689 million in 2019 for the sale of the Envista common stock and subsequent earnings and other comprehensive income (loss) attributable to the noncontrolling interest. At the time of the Envista Disposition, Danaher decreased noncontrolling interests by $692 million to record the deconsolidation of Envista and the elimination of the noncontrolling interest.\n\nThe accounting requirements for reporting Envista as a discontinued operation were met when the Split-Off was completed. Accordingly, the Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented reflect this business as a discontinued operation. The Company allocated a portion of the consolidated interest expense to discontinued operations based on the ratio of the discontinued business' net assets to the Company's consolidated net assets. Envista had revenues of approximately $2.6 billion in 2019 prior to the exchange offer.\n\nAs a result of the Envista Disposition, the Company incurred $69 million in IPO and Separation-related costs during the year ended December 31, 2019, which are reflected in earnings from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. These costs primarily relate to professional fees associated with preparation of regulatory filings and activities within finance, tax, legal and information technology functions as well as certain investment banking fees and tax costs.\n\nDanaher used a portion of the consideration received from Envista to redeem $875 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness in the fourth quarter of 2019 (consisting of the Company's 2.4% senior unsecured notes due 2020 and 5.0% senior unsecured notes due 2020). The Company incurred make-whole premiums in connection with the redemption of $7 million ($5 million after-tax). The Company used the balance of the consideration it received from Envista to redeem commercial paper borrowings as they matured.\n\nIn connection with the Envista IPO and Separation, Danaher and Envista entered into various agreements to effect the disposition and provide a framework for their relationship after the Envista Separation, including a separation agreement, transition services agreement, employee matters agreement, tax matters agreement, intellectual property matters agreement and DANAHER BUSINESS SYSTEM ('DBS') license agreement. These agreements provide for the allocation between Danaher and Envista of assets, employees, liabilities and obligations (including investments, property and employee benefits and tax-",

Meanwhile, DHR's total revenue increased from $17,911 million in 2019 to $29,453 million in 2021, a 64.4% increase.

The 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan provides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, restricted stock, PSUs or any other stock-based award and cash-based awards. A total of approximately 127 million shares of Danaher common stock have been authorized for issuance under the 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 50 million shares of the Company's common stock remain available for issuance under the 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan.\n\nStock options granted prior to 2022 under the 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan generally vest pro rata over a five-year period and terminate ten years from the grant date, though the specific terms of each grant are determined by the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board (the 'Compensation Committee'). Stock options granted subsequent to December 31, 2021 under the amended and restated 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan generally vest pro rata over a four-year period and terminate ten years from the grant date, though specific terms of each grant are determined by the Compensation Committee. The Company's executive officers and certain other employees have been awarded options with different vesting criteria, and options granted to outside directors are fully vested as of the grant date. Option exercise prices for options granted by the Company equal the closing price of the Company's common stock on the NYSE on the date of grant.\n\nRSUs issued under the 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan provide for the issuance of a share of the Company's common stock at no cost to the holder. RSUs granted prior to 2022 to employees under the 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan generally provide for time-based vesting over a five-year period, although executive officers and certain other employees have been awarded RSUs with different vesting criteria. RSUs granted subsequent to December 31, 2021 to employees under the amended and restated 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan generally vest pro rata over a four-year period, although executive officers and certain other employees have been awarded RSUs with different vesting criteria. The RSUs that have been granted to directors under the 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan vest on the earlier of the first anniversary of the grant date or the date of, and immediately prior to, the next annual meeting of the Company's shareholders following the grant date, but the underlying shares are not issued until the earlier of the director's death or the first day of the seventh month following the director's retirement from the Board. Prior to vesting, RSUs granted under the 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan do not have dividend equivalent rights, do not have voting rights and the shares underlying the RSUs are not considered issued and outstanding.\n\nPSUs issued under the 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan provide for the issuance of a share of the Company's common stock at no cost to the holder, vest based on specified performance criteria, are subject to an additional holding period following vesting and are entitled to dividend equivalent rights. The PSU dividend equivalent rights are subject to the same vesting and payment restrictions as the related shares, and the shares underlying the PSUs are not considered issued and outstanding.\n\nIn connection with the Envista Disposition, Envista adopted a stock-based compensation plan, which provided for stock-based awards denominated in shares of Envista common stock. Envista employees who participated in the Danaher stock compensation program prior to the Separation continued to participate in such program solely with respect to outstanding compensation awards received prior to the Separation, until the Split-Off (at which time such awards were terminated and replaced with awards denominated in Envista common stock under the Envista stock compensation plan). Stock-based compensation expense for Envista is included in results from discontinued operations.\n\nThe equity compensation awards granted by the Company generally vest only if the employee is employed by the Company (or in the case of directors, the director continues to serve on the Company Board) on the vesting date or in other limited circumstances, including following a qualifying retirement.

(Soliton). Soliton's RESONIC (Rapid Acoustic Pulse device) has U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance for the longterm improvement in the appearance of cellulite up to one year. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. Total consideration transferred allocated to the purchase price consisted of cash consideration of $535 million paid to holders of Soliton common stock, equity-based awards and warrants. As of the transaction date, AbbVie acquired $407 million of intangible assets for developed product rights and assumed deferred tax liabilities totaling $63 million. Other assets and liabilities were insignificant. The acquisition resulted in the recognition of $177 million of goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes.\n\n## Acquisition of Luminera\n\nIn October 2020, AbbVie entered into an agreement with Luminera, a privately held aesthetics company based in Israel, to acquire Luminera's full dermal filler portfolio and R&amp;D pipeline including HArmonyCa, a dermal filler intended for facial soft tissue augmentation. The aggregate accounting purchase price of $186 million was comprised of a $122 million upfront cash payment and $64 million for the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, for which AbbVie may owe up to $90 million in future payments upon achievement of certain commercial milestones. The agreement was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. As of the acquisition date, AbbVie acquired $127 million of intangible assets for in-process research and development and $33 million of intangible assets for developed",

In addition, the unaudited pro forma financial information is not a projection of future results of operations of the combined company nor does it reflect the expected realization of any synergies or cost savings associated with the acquisition.\n\n## Acquisition of Soliton, Inc.\n\nIn December 2021, AbbVie completed its previously announced acquisition of Soliton, Inc. (Soliton). Soliton's RESONIC (Rapid Acoustic Pulse device) has U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance for the longterm improvement in the appearance of cellulite up to one year. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. Total consideration transferred allocated to the purchase price consisted of cash consideration of $535 million paid to holders of Soliton common stock, equity-based awards and warrants. As of the transaction date, AbbVie acquired $407 million of intangible assets for developed product rights and assumed deferred tax liabilities totaling $63 million. Other assets and liabilities were insignificant.

The aggregate accounting purchase price of $186 million was comprised of a $122 million upfront cash payment and $64 million for the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, for which AbbVie may owe up to $90 million in future payments upon achievement of certain commercial milestones. The agreement was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. As of the acquisition date, AbbVie acquired $127 million of intangible assets for in-process research and development and $33 million of intangible assets for developed",

          "chunk_text": "The defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plan allocation for the U.S. and Puerto Rico currently comprises approximately 80 percent growth inv estments and 20 percent fixed-income inv estments. The growth inv estment allocation encompasses U.S. and international public equity securities, hedge funds, priv ate equity-like inv estments, and real estate. These portfolio allocations are intended to reduce ov erall risk by prov iding div ersification, while seeking moderate to high returns ov er the long term.\n\nPublic equity securities are well div ersified and inv ested in U.S. and international small-to-large companies across v arious asset managers and styles. The remaining portion of the growth portfolio is inv ested in priv ate alternativ e inv estments.\n\nFixed-income inv estments primarily consist of fixed-income securities in U.S. treasuries and agencies, emerging market debt obligations, corporate bonds, bank loans, mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed obligations, and any related repurchase agreements.\n\nHedge funds are priv ately owned institutional inv estment funds that generally hav e moderate liquidity. Hedge funds seek specified lev els of absolute return regardless of ov erall market conditions, and generally hav e low correlations to public equity and debt markets. Hedge funds often inv est substantially in financial market instruments (stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, deriv ativ es, etc.) using a v ery broad range of trading activ ities to manage portfolio risks. Hedge fund strategies focus primarily on security selection and seek to be neutral with respect to market mov es. Common groupings of hedge fund strategies include relativ e v alue, tactical, and ev ent driv en. Relativ e v alue strategies include arbitrage, when the same asset can simultaneously be bought and sold at different prices, achiev ing an immediate profit. Tactical strategies often take long and short positions to reduce or eliminate ov erall market risks while seeking a particular inv estment opportunity. Ev ent strategy opportunities can ev olv e from specific company announcements such as mergers and acquisitions, and typically hav e little correlation to ov erall market directional mov ements. Our hedge fund inv estments are made through limited partnership interests in fund-of-funds structures and directly into hedge funds. Plan holdings in hedge funds are valued based on net asset v alues (NAVs) calculated by each fund or general partner, as applicable, and we hav e the ability to redeem these inv estments at NAV.\n\nPriv ate equity-like inv estment funds typically hav e low liquidity and are made through long-term partnerships or joint v entures that inv est in pools of capital inv ested in primarily non-publicly traded entities. Underlying inv estments include v enture capital (early stage inv esting), buyout, special situations, priv ate debt, and priv ate real estate inv estments. Priv ate equity management firms typically acquire and then reorganize priv ate companies to create increased long term v alue. Priv ate equity-like funds usually hav e a limited life of approximately 10-15 years, and require a minimum inv estment commitment from their limited partners. Our priv ate equity-like inv estments are made both directly into funds and through fund-of-funds structures to ensure broad div ersification of management styles and assets across the portfolio. Plan holdings in priv ate equity-like inv estments are v alued using the value reported by the partnership, adjusted for known cash flows and significant ev ents through our reporting date. Values prov ided by the partnerships are primarily based on analysis of and judgments about the underlying inv estments. Inputs to these v aluations include underlying NAVs, discounted cash flow v aluations, comparable market v aluations, and may also include adjustments for currency, credit, liquidity and other risks as applicable. The vast majority of these priv ate partnerships prov ide us with annual audited financial statements including their compliance with fair v aluation procedures consistent with applicable accounting standards.\n\nReal estate is composed of public holdings. Real estate inv estments in registered inv estment companies that trade on an exchange are classified as Level 1 on the fair v alue hierarchy. Real estate inv estments in funds measured at fair v alue on the basis of NAV prov ided by the fund manager are classified as such. These NAVs are dev eloped with inputs including discounted cash flow, independent appraisal, and market comparable analyses.\n\nOther assets include cash and cash equiv alents and mark-to-market v alue of deriv ativ es.\n\nThe cash value of the trust-owned insurance contract is primarily inv ested in inv estment-grade publicly traded equity and fixed-income securities.\n\nOther than hedge funds, priv ate equity-like inv estments, and a portion of the real estate holdings, which are discussed abov e, we determine fair v alues based on a market approach using quoted market v alues, significant other observ able inputs for identical or comparable assets or liabilities, or discounted cash flow analyses.",

      "question": "How did LLY's revenue from Baqsimi change between 2023 and 2024, considering both U.S. and Outside U.S. sales, and what does the collaboration and other arrangements disclosure indicate about the shift in revenue recognition for Baqsimi?",
      "answer": "LLY's total revenue from Baqsimi dropped significantly from $677.6 million in 2023 (U.S. $645.7 million + Outside U.S. $31.9 million) to only $29.2 million in 2024 (U.S. $2.5 million + Outside U.S. $26.7 million). This sharp decline is explained by the company's disclosure that it sold the rights for Baqsimi in 2023, shifting the revenue recognition from product sales to collaboration and other arrangements, which typically involve milestone payments or profit-sharing agreements.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Baqsimi's U.S. revenue was $2.5 million in 2024 and $645.7 million in 2023; Outside U.S. revenue was $26.7 million in 2024 and $31.9 million in 2023.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - LLY disclosed that the 2023 sales of rights for Baqsimi moved its revenue recognition from product sales to the collaboration and other arrangements category.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The significant drop in Baqsimi revenue from 2023 to 2024 is directly tied to LLY no longer recognizing revenue through product sales after selling the rights in 2023, which explains the shift to collaboration and other arrangements revenue recognition."

      "question": "How does the regulatory exclusivity risk for Opdivo in the U.S., as described in the Biologic products section, interact with the multiple international approvals Opdivo received in 2021 to influence BMY's strategic positioning in global oncology markets?",
      "answer": "Opdivo faces potential biosimilar competition in the U.S. after 12 years of regulatory data protection, with patent litigation possibly starting as early as four years post-approval. Given Opdivo received multiple international approvals in 2021 (e.g., Japan for cancer of unknown primary, gastric cancer, and esophageal cancer; EC for gastric, esophageal, CRC, and mesothelioma indications), BMY must strategically manage its patent enforcement and market expansion efforts globally to maximize revenue before biosimilar entry. This global regulatory diversification may help offset potential U.S. market erosion.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Opdivo received multiple international approvals in 2021, including in Japan and the EC, for various oncology indications.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Opdivo, as a biologic, is subject to U.S. biosimilar regulations, with data protection lasting 12 years post-FDA approval and potential patent challenges starting at 4 years post-approval.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The multiple international approvals expand Opdivo's market reach and potential revenue streams, while the U.S. regulatory framework introduces a defined timeline of exclusivity risk. BMY must strategically manage global growth and patent enforcement to maintain Opdivo's commercial success before biosimilar competition emerges."

          "chunk_text": "## Biologic products\n\nThe  U.S.  healthcare  legislation  enacted  in  2010  created  an  approval  pathway  for  biosimilar  versions  of  innovative  biological products  that  did  not  previously  exist.  Prior  to  that  time,  innovative  biologics  had  essentially  unlimited  regulatory  exclusivity. Under the new regulatory mechanism, the FDA can approve products that are similar to (but not generic copies of) innovative biologics on the basis of less extensive data than is required by a full BLA. After an innovator has marketed its product for four years, any manufacturer may file an application for approval of a 'biosimilar' version of the innovator product. However, although an  application  for  approval  of  a  biosimilar  version  may  be  filed  four  years  after  approval  of  the  innovator  product,  qualified innovative  biological  products  will  receive  12  years  of  regulatory  data  protection,  meaning  that  the  FDA  may  not  approve  a biosimilar version until 12 years after the innovative biological product was first approved by the FDA. The law also provides a mechanism  for  innovators  to  enforce  the  patents  that  protect  innovative  biological  products  and  for  biosimilar  applicants  to challenge  the  patents.  Such  patent  litigation  may  begin  as  early  as  four  years  after  the  innovative  biological  product  is  first approved by the FDA.\n\nThe increased likelihood of generic and biosimilar challenges to innovators' intellectual property has increased the risk of loss of innovators' market exclusivity. First, generic companies have increasingly sought to challenge innovators' basic patents covering major  pharmaceutical  products.  Second,  statutory  and  regulatory  provisions  may  limit  the  ability  of  an  innovator  company  to prevent generic and biosimilar drugs from being approved and launched while patent litigation is ongoing. As a result of all of these developments, among others, it is not possible to predict the length of market exclusivity for a particular product with certainty based  solely  on  the  expiration  of  the  relevant  patent(s)  or  the  current  forms  of  regulatory  exclusivity.  Our  marketed  biologic products include Opdivo , Yervoy , Orencia, Reblozyl and Empliciti .\n\n## European Union\n\nPatents on pharmaceutical products are generally enforceable in the EU and, as in the U.S., may be extended to compensate for the patent term lost during the regulatory review process. Such extensions are granted on a country-by-country basis.\n\nThe  primary  route  we  use  to  obtain  marketing  authorization  of  pharmaceutical  products  in  the  EU  is  through  the  'centralized procedure.' This procedure is compulsory for certain pharmaceutical products, in particular those using biotechnological processes, and  is  also  available  for  certain  new  chemical  compounds  and  products.  A  company  seeking  to  market  an  innovative pharmaceutical product through the centralized procedure must file a complete set of safety data and efficacy data as part of an MAA with the EMA. After the EMA evaluates the MAA, it provides a recommendation to the EC and the EC then approves or denies  the  MAA. It  is  also  possible  for  new  chemical  products  to  obtain  marketing  authorization  in  the  EU  through  a  'mutual recognition  procedure,'  in  which  an  application  is  made  to  a  single  member  state,  and  if  the  member  state  approves  the pharmaceutical  product  under  a  national  procedure,  then  the  applicant  may  submit  that  approval  to  the  mutual  recognition procedure of some or all other member states.\n\nAfter  obtaining  marketing  authorization  approval,  a  company  must  obtain  pricing  and  reimbursement  for  the  pharmaceutical product, which is typically subject to member state law. In certain EU countries, this process can take place simultaneously while the product is marketed but in other EU countries, this process must be completed before the company can market the new product. The pricing and reimbursement procedure can take months and sometimes years to complete.\n\nThroughout the EU, all products for which marketing authorizations have been filed after October/November 2005 are subject to an '8+2+1' regime. Eight years after the innovator has received its first community authorization for a medicinal product, a generic company may file a MAA for that product with the health authorities. If the MAA is approved, the generic company may not commercialize the product until after either 10 or 11 years have elapsed from the initial marketing authorization granted to the innovator.  The  possible  extension  to  11  years  is  available  if  the  innovator,  during  the  first  eight  years  of  the  marketing authorization,  obtains  an  additional  indication  that  is  of  significant  clinical  benefit  in  comparison  with  existing  treatments.  For products  that  were  filed  prior  to  October/November  2005,  there  is  a  10-year  period  of  regulatory  data  protection  under  the centralized procedures and a period of either six or 10 years under the mutual recognition procedure (depending on the member state).\n\nIn contrast to the U.S., patents in the EU are not listed with regulatory authorities. Generic versions of pharmaceutical products can be approved after data protection expires, regardless of whether the innovator holds patents covering its drug. Thus, it is possible that an innovator may be seeking to enforce its patents against a generic competitor that is already marketing its product. Also, the European patent system has an opposition procedure in which generic manufacturers may challenge the validity of patents covering innovator products within nine months of grant.\n\nIn  general,  EU  law  treats  chemically-synthesized  drugs  and  biologically-derived  drugs  the  same  with  respect  to  intellectual property and data protection. In addition to the relevant legislation and annexes related to biologic medicinal products, the EMA has  issued  guidelines  that  outline  the  additional  information  to  be  provided  for  biosimilar  products,  also  known  as  generic biologics, in order to review an application for marketing approval.",

      "question": "How does the regulatory data protection period for biologic products in the U.S. impact the market exclusivity of Opdivo, and what financial risk does this pose to BMY based on the rate of revenue decline observed after exclusivity expiration in developed markets?",
      "answer": "The U.S. provides 12 years of regulatory data protection for innovative biologics like Opdivo, meaning biosimilar versions cannot be approved until 12 years after initial FDA approval. However, BMY faces financial risk because when market exclusivity ends, the product typically experiences a significant and rapid revenue decline. In developed markets like the U.S. and certain EU countries, revenue can drop sharply\u2014often losing a major portion in a short period\u2014especially for products used in large patient populations or those that are simpler to manufacture. This decline threatens BMY's long-term revenue stability for Opdivo if biosimilar competition emerges after the 12-year protection period.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_b - Opdivo is a biologic product and receives 12 years of regulatory data protection in the U.S., preventing biosimilar approval until that period ends.",

          "chunk_text": "Advancements in treating cancer with IO therapies continue to evolve at a rapid pace. Our IO products, particularly Opdivo , operate in a highly competitive marketplace. In addition to competing for market share with other IO products in approved indications such as lung cancer and melanoma, we face increased competition from existing competing IO products that receive FDA approval for additional indications and for new IO agents that receive FDA approval and enter the market. Furthermore, as therapies combining different  IO  products  or  IO  products  with  existing  chemotherapy  or  targeted  therapy  treatments  are  investigated  for  potential expanded approvals, we anticipate that our IO products will continue to experience intense competition.\n\nAnother  competitive  challenge  we  face  is  from  generic  pharmaceutical  manufacturers.  In  the  U.S.  and  the  EU,  the  regulatory approval  process  exempts  generics  from  costly  and  time-consuming  clinical  studies  to  demonstrate  their  safety  and  efficacy, allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy of the innovator product. As a result, generic pharmaceutical manufacturers  typically  invest  far  less  in  R&amp;D  than  research-based  pharmaceutical  companies  and  therefore  can  price  their products significantly lower than branded products. Accordingly, when a branded product loses its market exclusivity, it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product. Upon the expiration or loss of market exclusivity on a product, we can lose the major portion of that product's revenue in a very short period of time.\n\nAfter the expiration of exclusivity, the rate of revenue decline of a product varies by country. In general, the decline in the U.S. market is more rapid than in most other developed countries, though we have observed rapid declines in a number of EU countries as well. Also, the declines in developed countries tend to be more rapid than in developing countries. The rate of revenue decline after the expiration of exclusivity has also historically been influenced by product characteristics. For example, drugs that are used in a large patient population (e.g., those prescribed by key primary care physicians) tend to experience more rapid declines than drugs  in  specialized  areas  of  medicine  (e.g.,  oncology).  Drugs  that  are  more  complex  to  manufacture  (e.g.,  sterile  injectable products) usually experience a slower decline than those that are simpler to manufacture.\n\nIn certain countries outside the U.S., patent protection is weak or nonexistent and we must compete with generic versions shortly after we launch our innovative products. In addition, generic pharmaceutical companies may introduce a generic product before exclusivity has expired, and before the resolution of any related patent litigation. For more information about market exclusivity, refer to '-Products, Intellectual Property and Product Exclusivity.'\n\nWe believe our long-term competitive position depends upon our success in discovering and developing innovative, cost-effective products that serve unmet medical needs, along with our ability to manufacture products efficiently and to market them effectively in a highly competitive environment.\n\n## Pricing, Price Constraints and Market Access\n\nOur medicines are priced based on a number of factors, including the value of scientific innovation for patients and society in the context of overall health care spend, economic factors impacting health care systems' ability to provide appropriate and sustainable access and the necessity to sustain our investment in innovation platforms to address unmet medical needs. Central to price is the clinical  value  that  this  innovation  brings  to  the  market,  the  current  landscape  of  alternative  treatment  options  and  the  goals  of ensuring appropriate patient access to this innovation and sustaining investment in creative platforms. We continue to explore new pricing approaches to ensure that patients have access to our medicines. Enhancing patient access to medicines is a priority for us. We are  focused  on:  offering  creative  tiered  pricing,  reimbursement  support  and  patient  assistance  programs  to  optimize  access while protecting innovation; advocating for sustainable healthcare policies and infrastructure, leveraging advocacy/payer's input and  utilizing  partnerships  as  appropriate;  and  improving  access  to  care  and  supportive  services  for  vulnerable  patients  through partnerships and demonstration projects.\n\nAn important factor on which the pricing of our medicines depends is government regulation. We have been subject to increasing international and domestic efforts by various governments to implement or strengthen measures to regulate pharmaceutical market access and product pricing and payment. In the U.S., we are required to provide discounts on purchases of pharmaceutical products under various federal and state healthcare programs. Federal government officials and legislators continue to face intense pressure from the public to manage the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals and have responded by pursuing legislation and rules that they claim would further reduce the cost of drugs for the federal government and other stakeholders. We are also now required to comply with recently enacted state laws that seek additional transparency into the cost of prescription drugs. We are monitoring efforts by states to seek additional rebates and limit state spending on drugs in light of budget pressures. These international, federal and state legislative and regulatory developments could create new constraints on our ability to set prices and/or impact our market access in certain areas. For further discussion on the pricing pressure and its risk, refer to 'Part I-Item 1A. Risk Factors-Product, Industry and Operational Risks-Increased pricing pressure and other restrictions in the U.S. and abroad continue to negatively affect our revenues and profit margins.'",

          "chunk_text": "## Biologic products\n\nThe  U.S.  healthcare  legislation  enacted  in  2010  created  an  approval  pathway  for  biosimilar  versions  of  innovative  biological products  that  did  not  previously  exist.  Prior  to  that  time,  innovative  biologics  had  essentially  unlimited  regulatory  exclusivity. Under the new regulatory mechanism, the FDA can approve products that are similar to (but not generic copies of) innovative biologics on the basis of less extensive data than is required by a full BLA. After an innovator has marketed its product for four years, any manufacturer may file an application for approval of a 'biosimilar' version of the innovator product. However, although an  application  for  approval  of  a  biosimilar  version  may  be  filed  four  years  after  approval  of  the  innovator  product,  qualified innovative  biological  products  will  receive  12  years  of  regulatory  data  protection,  meaning  that  the  FDA  may  not  approve  a biosimilar version until 12 years after the innovative biological product was first approved by the FDA. The law also provides a mechanism  for  innovators  to  enforce  the  patents  that  protect  innovative  biological  products  and  for  biosimilar  applicants  to challenge  the  patents.  Such  patent  litigation  may  begin  as  early  as  four  years  after  the  innovative  biological  product  is  first approved by the FDA.\n\nThe increased likelihood of generic and biosimilar challenges to innovators' intellectual property has increased the risk of loss of innovators' market exclusivity. First, generic companies have increasingly sought to challenge innovators' basic patents covering major  pharmaceutical  products.  Second,  statutory  and  regulatory  provisions  may  limit  the  ability  of  an  innovator  company  to prevent generic and biosimilar drugs from being approved and launched while patent litigation is ongoing. As a result of all of these developments, among others, it is not possible to predict the length of market exclusivity for a particular product with certainty based  solely  on  the  expiration  of  the  relevant  patent(s)  or  the  current  forms  of  regulatory  exclusivity.  Our  marketed  biologic products include Opdivo , Yervoy , Orencia, Reblozyl and Empliciti .\n\n## European Union\n\nPatents on pharmaceutical products are generally enforceable in the EU and, as in the U.S., may be extended to compensate for the patent term lost during the regulatory review process. Such extensions are granted on a country-by-country basis.\n\nThe  primary  route  we  use  to  obtain  marketing  authorization  of  pharmaceutical  products  in  the  EU  is  through  the  'centralized procedure.' This procedure is compulsory for certain pharmaceutical products, in particular those using biotechnological processes, and  is  also  available  for  certain  new  chemical  compounds  and  products.  A  company  seeking  to  market  an  innovative pharmaceutical product through the centralized procedure must file a complete set of safety data and efficacy data as part of an MAA with the EMA. After the EMA evaluates the MAA, it provides a recommendation to the EC and the EC then approves or denies  the  MAA. It  is  also  possible  for  new  chemical  products  to  obtain  marketing  authorization  in  the  EU  through  a  'mutual recognition  procedure,'  in  which  an  application  is  made  to  a  single  member  state,  and  if  the  member  state  approves  the pharmaceutical  product  under  a  national  procedure,  then  the  applicant  may  submit  that  approval  to  the  mutual  recognition procedure of some or all other member states.\n\nAfter  obtaining  marketing  authorization  approval,  a  company  must  obtain  pricing  and  reimbursement  for  the  pharmaceutical product, which is typically subject to member state law. In certain EU countries, this process can take place simultaneously while the product is marketed but in other EU countries, this process must be completed before the company can market the new product. The pricing and reimbursement procedure can take months and sometimes years to complete.\n\nThroughout the EU, all products for which marketing authorizations have been filed after October/November 2005 are subject to an '8+2+1' regime. Eight years after the innovator has received its first community authorization for a medicinal product, a generic company may file a MAA for that product with the health authorities. If the MAA is approved, the generic company may not commercialize the product until after either 10 or 11 years have elapsed from the initial marketing authorization granted to the innovator.  The  possible  extension  to  11  years  is  available  if  the  innovator,  during  the  first  eight  years  of  the  marketing authorization,  obtains  an  additional  indication  that  is  of  significant  clinical  benefit  in  comparison  with  existing  treatments.  For products  that  were  filed  prior  to  October/November  2005,  there  is  a  10-year  period  of  regulatory  data  protection  under  the centralized procedures and a period of either six or 10 years under the mutual recognition procedure (depending on the member state).\n\nIn contrast to the U.S., patents in the EU are not listed with regulatory authorities. Generic versions of pharmaceutical products can be approved after data protection expires, regardless of whether the innovator holds patents covering its drug. Thus, it is possible that an innovator may be seeking to enforce its patents against a generic competitor that is already marketing its product. Also, the European patent system has an opposition procedure in which generic manufacturers may challenge the validity of patents covering innovator products within nine months of grant.\n\nIn  general,  EU  law  treats  chemically-synthesized  drugs  and  biologically-derived  drugs  the  same  with  respect  to  intellectual property and data protection. In addition to the relevant legislation and annexes related to biologic medicinal products, the EMA has  issued  guidelines  that  outline  the  additional  information  to  be  provided  for  biosimilar  products,  also  known  as  generic biologics, in order to review an application for marketing approval.",

      "question": "How does the regulatory exclusivity timeline for Opdivo in the U.S. interact with the multiple FDA and EMA approvals Opdivo received in 2021 for new indications, and what implications does this have for potential biosimilar competition?",
      "answer": "Opdivo received multiple FDA and EMA approvals in 2021 for new indications in bladder, gastric, and esophageal cancers, which may extend its market exclusivity. Under U.S. law, Opdivo, as a biologic, is granted 12 years of regulatory data protection from the time of its initial FDA approval. If Opdivo\u2019s first FDA approval was in 2014 (as the drug was approved for melanoma that year), its core U.S. exclusivity would last until 2026. However, new indications approved in 2021\u2014such as the adjuvant treatment of bladder cancer (August 2021), esophageal cancer (May 2021), and gastric cancer (April 2021)\u2014could provide additional exclusivity periods for those specific uses, potentially delaying biosimilar competition further. In the EU, the '8+2+1' regime allows for up to 11 years of exclusivity if a significant new indication is added within the first 8 years. Since Opdivo received multiple new indications in 2021, which may be considered of significant clinical benefit, its exclusivity in the EU could also be extended, pushing potential biosimilar entry beyond the base 10-year mark.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Opdivo received multiple FDA and EMA approvals in 2021 for new indications including bladder (August 2021), gastric (April 2021), and esophageal cancers (May 2021).",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - In the U.S., biologics receive 12 years of regulatory data protection from the date of first FDA approval, and biosimilar approval cannot occur until this period ends.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b - In the EU, the '8+2+1' regime allows for up to 11 years of exclusivity if a new indication of significant clinical benefit is added within the first 8 years.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The 2021 approvals may extend Opdivo\u2019s exclusivity in both the U.S. and EU, delaying biosimilar entry and protecting revenue streams for a longer period."

          "chunk_text": "## Biologic products\n\nThe  U.S.  healthcare  legislation  enacted  in  2010  created  an  approval  pathway  for  biosimilar  versions  of  innovative  biological products  that  did  not  previously  exist.  Prior  to  that  time,  innovative  biologics  had  essentially  unlimited  regulatory  exclusivity. Under the new regulatory mechanism, the FDA can approve products that are similar to (but not generic copies of) innovative biologics on the basis of less extensive data than is required by a full BLA. After an innovator has marketed its product for four years, any manufacturer may file an application for approval of a 'biosimilar' version of the innovator product. However, although an  application  for  approval  of  a  biosimilar  version  may  be  filed  four  years  after  approval  of  the  innovator  product,  qualified innovative  biological  products  will  receive  12  years  of  regulatory  data  protection,  meaning  that  the  FDA  may  not  approve  a biosimilar version until 12 years after the innovative biological product was first approved by the FDA. The law also provides a mechanism  for  innovators  to  enforce  the  patents  that  protect  innovative  biological  products  and  for  biosimilar  applicants  to challenge  the  patents.  Such  patent  litigation  may  begin  as  early  as  four  years  after  the  innovative  biological  product  is  first approved by the FDA.\n\nThe increased likelihood of generic and biosimilar challenges to innovators' intellectual property has increased the risk of loss of innovators' market exclusivity. First, generic companies have increasingly sought to challenge innovators' basic patents covering major  pharmaceutical  products.  Second,  statutory  and  regulatory  provisions  may  limit  the  ability  of  an  innovator  company  to prevent generic and biosimilar drugs from being approved and launched while patent litigation is ongoing. As a result of all of these developments, among others, it is not possible to predict the length of market exclusivity for a particular product with certainty based  solely  on  the  expiration  of  the  relevant  patent(s)  or  the  current  forms  of  regulatory  exclusivity.  Our  marketed  biologic products include Opdivo , Yervoy , Orencia, Reblozyl and Empliciti .\n\n## European Union\n\nPatents on pharmaceutical products are generally enforceable in the EU and, as in the U.S., may be extended to compensate for the patent term lost during the regulatory review process. Such extensions are granted on a country-by-country basis.\n\nThe  primary  route  we  use  to  obtain  marketing  authorization  of  pharmaceutical  products  in  the  EU  is  through  the  'centralized procedure.' This procedure is compulsory for certain pharmaceutical products, in particular those using biotechnological processes, and  is  also  available  for  certain  new  chemical  compounds  and  products.  A  company  seeking  to  market  an  innovative pharmaceutical product through the centralized procedure must file a complete set of safety data and efficacy data as part of an MAA with the EMA. After the EMA evaluates the MAA, it provides a recommendation to the EC and the EC then approves or denies  the  MAA. It  is  also  possible  for  new  chemical  products  to  obtain  marketing  authorization  in  the  EU  through  a  'mutual recognition  procedure,'  in  which  an  application  is  made  to  a  single  member  state,  and  if  the  member  state  approves  the pharmaceutical  product  under  a  national  procedure,  then  the  applicant  may  submit  that  approval  to  the  mutual  recognition procedure of some or all other member states.\n\nAfter  obtaining  marketing  authorization  approval,  a  company  must  obtain  pricing  and  reimbursement  for  the  pharmaceutical product, which is typically subject to member state law. In certain EU countries, this process can take place simultaneously while the product is marketed but in other EU countries, this process must be completed before the company can market the new product. The pricing and reimbursement procedure can take months and sometimes years to complete.\n\nThroughout the EU, all products for which marketing authorizations have been filed after October/November 2005 are subject to an '8+2+1' regime. Eight years after the innovator has received its first community authorization for a medicinal product, a generic company may file a MAA for that product with the health authorities. If the MAA is approved, the generic company may not commercialize the product until after either 10 or 11 years have elapsed from the initial marketing authorization granted to the innovator.  The  possible  extension  to  11  years  is  available  if  the  innovator,  during  the  first  eight  years  of  the  marketing authorization,  obtains  an  additional  indication  that  is  of  significant  clinical  benefit  in  comparison  with  existing  treatments.  For products  that  were  filed  prior  to  October/November  2005,  there  is  a  10-year  period  of  regulatory  data  protection  under  the centralized procedures and a period of either six or 10 years under the mutual recognition procedure (depending on the member state).\n\nIn contrast to the U.S., patents in the EU are not listed with regulatory authorities. Generic versions of pharmaceutical products can be approved after data protection expires, regardless of whether the innovator holds patents covering its drug. Thus, it is possible that an innovator may be seeking to enforce its patents against a generic competitor that is already marketing its product. Also, the European patent system has an opposition procedure in which generic manufacturers may challenge the validity of patents covering innovator products within nine months of grant.\n\nIn  general,  EU  law  treats  chemically-synthesized  drugs  and  biologically-derived  drugs  the  same  with  respect  to  intellectual property and data protection. In addition to the relevant legislation and annexes related to biologic medicinal products, the EMA has  issued  guidelines  that  outline  the  additional  information  to  be  provided  for  biosimilar  products,  also  known  as  generic biologics, in order to review an application for marketing approval.",

      "question": "How does Opdivo's regulatory data protection timeline in the U.S. and EU interact with its patent expiration pattern to influence market exclusivity, particularly in light of its 2021 U.S. revenue growth of 7%?",
      "answer": "Opdivo, as a biologic product, benefits from 12 years of regulatory data protection in the U.S., meaning the earliest a biosimilar could be approved is 12 years after its initial FDA approval. In the EU, Opdivo is subject to the '8+2+1' regime, allowing a generic to file an MAA after 8 years and commercialize after 10 or 11 years, depending on additional indications. In the U.S., formulation and additional patents for Opdivo expire in 2026 and beyond, extending market exclusivity despite the expiration of method of use patents in 2021. The 7% U.S. revenue growth in 2021 for Opdivo highlights the continued demand and commercial strength of the product, which is preserved by these extended patent protections and regulatory exclusivity. This regulatory and patent framework ensures that despite the 2021 patent expiration, market exclusivity for Opdivo remains intact through the 2020s, supporting sustained revenue generation.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Opdivo's U.S. revenue increased by 7% in 2021 due to higher demand across multiple therapies and higher average net selling prices.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - In the U.S., biologics receive 12 years of regulatory data protection, meaning biosimilars cannot be approved until 12 years after initial FDA approval.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b - In the EU, the '8+2+1' regime allows generic applications after 8 years, with commercialization possible after 10 or 11 years, depending on additional clinical benefits.",
        "Step 4: Extract from evidence_source_b - Opdivo's method of use patents expired in 2021, but formulation and additional patents extend beyond 2026, supporting continued market exclusivity.",
        "Step 5: Synthesize - The 7% U.S. revenue growth in 2021 for Opdivo demonstrates its market strength, which is protected by formulation and additional patents expiring after 2026. These patents, combined with the 12-year U.S. regulatory exclusivity and EU's '8+2+1' framework, ensure that despite the 2021 expiration of method of use patents, Opdivo retains market exclusivity well into the 2020s, preserving revenue streams."

There are several ongoing potentially registrational studies for Opdivo across other tumor types and disease areas, in monotherapy and in combination with Yervoy and various anti-cancer agents.\n\n- U.S.  revenues  increased  7%  in  2021  due  to  higher  demand  across  multiple  therapies  including  the Opdivo + Yervoy combinations  in  NSCLC, Opdivo + CABOMETYX *  combination  in  kidney  cancer  and Opdivo in  various  gastric  and esophageal cancers and higher average net selling prices, partially offset by declining second-line eligibility across tumor indications and increased competition.\n- International revenues increased 9% in 2021 due to higher demand and foreign exchange impacts of 2%, partially offset by lower average net selling prices. Excluding foreign exchange impacts, revenues increased by 7%.\n\nPomalyst/Imnovid (pomalidomide) - a proprietary, distinct, small molecule that is administered orally and modulates the immune system  and  other  biologically  important  targets. Pomalyst/Imnovid is  indicated  for  patients  with  multiple  myeloma  who  have received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor and have demonstrated disease progression on or within 60 days of completion of the last therapy.\n\n- U.S. revenues increased 5% in 2021 due to higher average net selling prices and higher demand.\n- International revenues increased 16% in 2021 due to higher demand and foreign exchange impacts of 2% partially offset by lower average net selling prices. Excluding foreign exchange impacts, revenues increased by 14%.\n\nOrencia (abatacept) - a fusion protein indicated for adult patients with moderately to severely active RA and PsA and is also indicated for reducing signs and symptoms in certain pediatric patients with moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA.\n\n- U.S. revenues increased 6% in 2021 due to higher demand.\n- International  revenues  remained  consistent  in  2021  due  to  foreign  exchange  impacts  of  2%,  offset  by  lower  demand. Excluding foreign exchange impacts, revenues decreased by 1%.\n- In the U.S. and EU, estimated minimum market exclusivity dates were previously based on method of use patents that expired in 2021.

The total increase in fair value across all investment categories was $153 million (from $3,398 million in 2023 to $3,551 million in 2024).

Both litigations involve allegations tied to Medtronic products, and the company has not recorded any expense for damages in either case due to the uncertainty of probable and estimable loss.",

        "Step 3: Compare and synthesize - Both litigations involve unresolved legal claims against Medtronic for alleged product defects. The Diabetes Pump litigation has fewer plaintiffs currently, but additional lawsuits are expected. The hernia mesh litigation already involves thousands of plaintiffs across multiple jurisdictions."

Approximately 6,700 plaintiffs have pending lawsuits in a coordinated proceeding in Massachusetts state court, where they have been consolidated before a single judge. Approximately 500 plaintiffs have pending lawsuits in a coordinated action in Minnesota  state  court,  and  there  are  approximately 1,150  actions  coordinated  in  a  federal  Multidistrict  Litigation  in  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  District  of Massachusetts plus six one-off cases filed in other courts. The pending lawsuits relate almost entirely to hernia mesh products that have not been subject to recalls, withdrawals, or other adverse regulatory action. The Company has not recorded an expense related to damages in connection with these matters because any potential loss is not currently probable and reasonably estimable. Additionally, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from these matters.\n\n## Diabetes Pump Retainer Ring Litigation\n\nStarting in fiscal year 2021, plaintiffs began filing lawsuits against the Diabetes operating unit in U.S. state and federal courts alleging personal injury from Series 600 insulin pumps with allegedly defective clear retainer rings that were subject to field corrective actions in 2019 and 2021. As of May 14, 2024, 27 lawsuits have been filed on behalf of a total of 107 individual plaintiffs, and certain plaintiffs' law firms have notified the Company that they may file additional lawsuits in the future on behalf of thousands of additional claimants. Most of the filed suits are coordinated in California state court. The Company has not recorded an expense related to damages in connection with these matters because any potential loss is not currently probable and reasonably estimable. Additionally, the  Company is unable to reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from these matters.\n\n## Environmental Proceedings\n\nThe Company is a successor to several investigation and cleanup actions at various stages related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites, including in Orrington, Maine. These projects relate to a variety of activities, including removal of solvents, metals and other hazardous substances from soil and groundwater. The ultimate cost of site cleanup and timing of future cash flows is difficult to predict given uncertainties regarding the ex tent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods.\n\nThe Company is also a successor to a party named in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine in the early 2000's by the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Maine People's Alliance relating to mercury contamination of the Penobscot River and Bay and options for remediating such contamination. In March 2021, the parties notified the court that they had agreed on a settlement in principle of all issues in this matter, and in September 2022 the parties filed a joint motion for  final  approval  by  the  court.  In  October  2022,  the  court  issued  a  final  order  approving  the  settlement  and  the  parties  are  working  with  consultants  on implementation of remedial activities. The final court order did not result in a change to the Company's previous accrual for this matter.\n\nThe Company's accrued expenses for these various environmental proceedings are included within accrued litigation as discussed above.\n\n## Anti-Corruption Matters\n\nThe Company has regular and ongoing interactions with governmental agencies, and its practice is to cooperate with such inquiries. In addition, from time to time, the Company self-discloses potential concerns to governmental regulators. Like many in the medical device industry or with international operations, the Company engages in periodic discussions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, U.S. Department of Justice, and various authorities in China regarding certain activities, including in China. The Company is committed to regularly evaluating and, as appropriate, strengthening its anti-corruption compliance programs and practices.

The U.S. Tax Court (Tax Court) reviewed this dispute, and in June 2016, issued an opinion with respect to the allocation of income between the parties for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 whereby it generally rejected the IRS's position, but also made certain modifications to the Medtronic, Inc. tax returns as filed. In April 2017, the IRS filed a Notice of Appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit regarding the Tax Court opinion.

Judgments related to these factors contemplated the impact of COVID-19.\n\nIn developing its medical costs payable estimates, the Company applies different estimation methods depending on which incurred claims are being estimated. For the most recent two months, the Company estimates claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data are available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors (actuarial estimates, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period adjudicated by the Company at the date of estimation). For months prior to the most recent two months, the Company applies the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months.\n\n## Cost of Products Sold\n\nThe Company's cost of products sold includes the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed to unaffiliated customers either directly at its home delivery, specialty and community pharmacy locations, or indirectly through its nationwide network of participating pharmacies. Rebates attributable to unaffiliated clients are accrued as rebates receivable and a reduction of cost of products sold, with a corresponding payable for the amounts of the rebates to be remitted to those unaffiliated clients in accordance with their contracts and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction of product revenue. Cost of products sold also includes the cost of personnel to support the Company's transaction processing services, system sales, maintenance and professional services.\n\n## Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments\n\nCash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments having an original maturity of three months or less. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value because of the short maturity of the instruments.\n\nInvestments with maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term. Because of regulatory requirements, certain investments are included in long-term investments regardless of their maturity date. The Company classifies these investments as held-to-maturity and reports them at amortized cost. Substantially all other investments are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value based on quoted market prices, where available. Equity investments, with certain exceptions, are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net earnings.\n\nThe Company excludes unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities from net earnings and reports them as comprehensive income and, net of income tax effects, as a separate component of equity. To calculate realized gains and losses on the sale of debt securities, the Company specifically identifies the cost of each investment sold.\n\nThe Company evaluates an available-for-sale debt security for credit-related impairment by considering the present value of expected cash flows relative to a security's amortized cost, the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and specific events or circumstances which may influence the operations of the issuer. Credit-related impairments are recorded as an allowance, with an offset to investment and other income. Non-credit related impairments are recorded through other comprehensive income. If the Company intends to sell an impaired security, or will likely be required to sell a security before recovery of the entire amortized cost, the entire impairment is included in net earnings.\n\nNew information and the passage of time can change these judgments. The Company manages its investment portfolio to limit its exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limits its investments to investment grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with the Company's investment policy.\n\n## Assets Under Management\n\nThe Company provides health insurance products and services to members of AARP under a Supplemental Health Insurance Program (the AARP Program) and to AARP members and non-members under separate Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D arrangements. The products and services under the AARP Program include supplemental Medicare benefits, hospital indemnity insurance, including insurance for individuals between 50 to 64 years of age, and other related products.\n\nPursuant to the Company's agreement with AARP, program assets are managed separately from the Company's general investment portfolio and are used to pay costs associated with the AARP Program. These assets are invested at the Company's discretion, within investment guidelines approved by AARP. The Company does not guarantee any rates of return on these investments and, upon any transfer of the AARP Program contract to another entity, the Company would transfer cash equal in amount to the fair value of these investments at the date of transfer to the entity. Because the purpose of these assets is to fund the medical costs payable, the rate stabilization fund (RSF) liabilities and other related liabilities associated with this AARP contract, assets under management are classified as current assets, consistent with the classification of these liabilities.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nmodels consider factors such as time from date of service to claim processing, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and demographics, the introduction of new technologies, benefit plan changes, and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. Judgments related to these factors contemplated the impact of COVID-19.\n\nIn developing its medical costs payable estimates, the Company applies different estimation methods depending on which incurred claims are being estimated. For the most recent two months, the Company estimates claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data are available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors (actuarial estimates, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period adjudicated by the Company at the date of estimation). For months prior to the most recent two months, the Company applies the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months.\n\n## Cost of Products Sold\n\nThe Company's cost of products sold includes the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed to unaffiliated customers either directly at its home delivery, specialty and community pharmacy locations, or indirectly through its nationwide network of participating pharmacies. Rebates attributable to unaffiliated clients are accrued as rebates receivable and a reduction of cost of products sold, with a corresponding payable for the amounts of the rebates to be remitted to those unaffiliated clients in accordance with their contracts and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction of product revenue. Cost of products sold also includes the cost of personnel to support the Company's transaction processing services, system sales, maintenance and professional services.\n\n## Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments\n\nCash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments having an original maturity of three months or less. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value because of the short maturity of the instruments.\n\nInvestments with maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term. Because of regulatory requirements, certain investments are included in long-term investments regardless of their maturity date. The Company classifies these investments as held-to-maturity and reports them at amortized cost. Substantially all other investments are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value based on quoted market prices, where available. Equity investments, with certain exceptions, are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net earnings.\n\nThe Company excludes unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities from net earnings and reports them as comprehensive income and, net of income tax effects, as a separate component of equity. To calculate realized gains and losses on the sale of debt securities, the Company specifically identifies the cost of each investment sold.\n\nThe Company evaluates an available-for-sale debt security for credit-related impairment by considering the present value of expected cash flows relative to a security's amortized cost, the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and specific events or circumstances which may influence the operations of the issuer. Credit-related impairments are recorded as an allowance, with an offset to investment and other income. Non-credit related impairments are recorded through other comprehensive income. If the Company intends to sell an impaired security, or will likely be required to sell a security before recovery of the entire amortized cost, the entire impairment is included in net earnings.\n\nNew information and the passage of time can change these judgments. The Company manages its investment portfolio to limit its exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limits its investments to investment grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with the Company's investment policy.\n\n## Assets Under Management\n\nThe Company provides health insurance products and services to members of AARP under a Supplemental Health Insurance Program (the AARP Program) and to AARP members and non-members under separate Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D arrangements. The products and services under the AARP Program include supplemental Medicare benefits, hospital indemnity insurance, including insurance for individuals between 50 to 64 years of age, and other related products.\n\nPursuant to the Company's agreement with AARP, program assets are managed separately from the Company's general investment portfolio and are used to pay costs associated with the AARP Program. These assets are invested at the Company's discretion, within investment guidelines approved by AARP. The Company does not guarantee any rates of return on these investments and, upon any transfer of the AARP Program contract to another entity, the Company would transfer cash equal in amount to the fair value of these investments at the date of transfer to the entity. Because the purpose of these assets is to fund the medical costs payable, the rate stabilization fund (RSF) liabilities and other related liabilities associated with this AARP contract, assets under management are classified as current assets, consistent with the classification of these liabilities.",

These matters have included or could in the future include matters related to health care benefits coverage and payment claims (including disputes with enrollees, customers and contracted and non-contracted physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals), tort claims (including claims related to the delivery of health care services, such as medical malpractice by staff at our affiliates' facilities, or by health care practitioners who are employed by us, have contractual relationships with us, or serve as providers to our managed care networks, including as a result of a failure to adhere to applicable clinical, quality and/or patient safety standards), antitrust claims (including as a result of changes in the enforcement of antitrust laws), whistleblower claims (including claims under the False Claims Act or similar statutes), contract and labor disputes, tax claims and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices. In addition, certain of our pharmacy services operations are subject to the clinical quality, patient safety and other risks inherent in the dispensing, packaging and distribution of drugs, including claims related to purported dispensing and other operational errors. We may also be party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups and consumers. We operate in jurisdictions outside of the United States where contractual rights, tax positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the United States, and therefore subject to dispute by customers, government authorities or others. Any failure by us to adhere to the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could subject us to civil and criminal penalties.\n\nWe are largely self-insured with regard to litigation risks, including claims of medical malpractice against our affiliated physicians and us. Although we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self-insured matters, it is possible the level of actual losses will significantly exceed the liabilities recorded. Additionally, physicians and other healthcare providers have become subject to an increasing number of legal actions alleging medical malpractice and general professional liabilities. Even in states that have imposed caps on damages for such actions, litigants are seeking recoveries under new theories of liability that might not be subject to the caps on damages. Many of these actions involve large claims and significant defense costs and, if these actions are asserted against us, could result in substantial monetary damages or damage to our reputation.\n\nWe cannot predict the outcome of significant legal actions in which we are involved and are incurring expenses in resolving these matters. The legal actions we face or may face in the future could further increase our cost of doing business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, certain legal actions could result in adverse publicity which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our ability to retain our current business or grow our market share in some markets and businesses.\n\nAny failure by us to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete, manage or integrate acquisitions and other significant strategic transactions or relationships domestically or outside the United States could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nAs part of our business strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, divestitures, strategic alliances, joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions. For example, we have a strategic alliance with AARP under which we provide AARP-branded Medicare Supplement insurance to AARP members and other AARP-branded products and services to Medicare beneficiaries. If we fail to meet the needs of our alliance or joint venture partners, including by developing additional products and services, providing high levels of service, pricing our products and services competitively or responding effectively to applicable federal and state regulatory changes, our alliances and joint ventures could be damaged or terminated which in turn could adversely impact our reputation, business and results of operations. Further, if we fail to identify and successfully complete transactions, which further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\n\nSuccess in completing acquisitions is also dependent on effectively integrating the acquired business into our existing operations, including our internal control environment and culture, or otherwise leveraging its operations which may present challenges different from those presented by organic growth and may be difficult for us to manage. In addition, even with appropriate diligence, pre-acquisition practices of an acquired business may expose us to legal challenges and investigations. For example, in January 2021, an indictment for alleged violations of antitrust laws was issued by the DOJ against our subsidiary, Surgical Care Affiliates (SCA), based on conduct alleged to have begun more than five years prior to our acquisition. We are vigorously defending this lawsuit, but if SCA is found liable, we may be subject to criminal fines or reputational harm. If we cannot successfully integrate these acquisitions and realize contemplated revenue growth opportunities",

UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement provides health care coverage for seniors and other eligible Medicare beneficiaries through the Medicare Advantage program administered by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), including Medicare Advantage HMO plans, Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) plans, Point-of-Service plans, PrivateFee-for-Service plans and Special Needs Plans (SNPs). Under the Medicare Advantage program, UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement provides health insurance coverage in exchange for a fixed monthly premium per member from CMS plus, in some cases, monthly consumer premiums. Premium amounts received from CMS vary based on the geographic areas in which individuals reside; demographic factors such as age, gender and institutionalized status; and the health status of the individual. Medicare Advantage plans are designed to compete at the local level, taking into account consumer and care provider preferences, competitor offerings, our quality and cost initiatives, our historical financial results and the long-term payment rate outlook for each geographic area. UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement served 6.5 million people through its Medicare Advantage products as of December 31, 2021.\n\nUnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement's senior-focused care management model operates at a medical cost level below traditional Medicare, while helping seniors live healthier lives. We have continued to enhance our offerings, focusing on more digital and physical care resources in the home, expanding our concierge navigation services and enabling the home as a safe and effective setting of care. For example, through our HouseCalls program, nurse practitioners performed more than 2.1 million clinical preventive home care visits in 2021 to address unmet care opportunities and close gaps in care. Our Navigate4Me program provides a single point of contact and a direct line of support for individuals as they go through their health care experiences. For high-risk patients in certain care settings and programs, UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement uses proprietary, automated medical record software and digital therapeutics for remote monitoring enabling clinical care teams to capture and track patient data and clinical encounters, creating a comprehensive set of care information bridging capabilities across home, hospital and nursing home care settings. Proprietary predictive modeling tools help identify people at high risk and enable care managers to create individualized care plans to help them obtain the right care, in the right place, at the right time.\n\nMedicare Part D. UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement provides Medicare Part D benefits to beneficiaries through its Medicare Advantage and stand-alone Medicare Part D plans. The stand-alone Medicare Part D plans address a large spectrum of people's needs and preferences for their prescription drug coverage, including low-cost prescription options. Each of the plans includes the majority of the drugs covered by Medicare and provides varying levels of coverage to meet the diverse needs of Medicare beneficiaries. As of December 31, 2021, UnitedHealthcare enrolled 9.5 million people in the Medicare Part D programs, including 3.7 million individuals in stand-alone Medicare Part D plans, with the remainder in Medicare Advantage plans incorporating Medicare Part D coverage.\n\nMedicare Supplement. UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement is currently serving 4.4 million seniors nationwide through various Medicare Supplement products in association with AARP. UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement offers a full range of supplemental products at diverse price points. These products cover various levels of coinsurance and deductible gaps to which seniors are exposed in the traditional Medicare program.\n\nPremium revenues from CMS represented 36% of UnitedHealth Group's total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021, most of which were generated by UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement.\n\n## UnitedHealthcare Community &amp; State\n\nUnitedHealthcare Community &amp; State is dedicated to serving state programs caring for the economically disadvantaged, the medically underserved and those without the benefit of employer-funded health care coverage, typically in exchange for a monthly premium per member from the state program. UnitedHealthcare Community &amp; State's primary customers oversee Medicaid plans, including Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF); Children's Health Insurance Programs (CHIP); Dual SNPs (DSNPs); Long-Term Services and Supports (LTSS); Aged, Blind and Disabled; and other federal, state and community health care programs. As of December 31, 2021, UnitedHealthcare Community &amp; State participated in programs in 32 states and the District of Columbia, and served 7.7 million people; including nearly 1.4 million people through Medicaid expansion programs in 18 states under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA).",

      "answer": "The earliest year that patent expiration could begin to materially impact the combined revenue stream of DARZALEX and DARZALEX FASPRO is 2029, when the U.S. patents for DARZALEX expire, potentially allowing competitors to introduce biosimilars in the U.S. market, which accounts for a significant portion of Johnson & Johnson's global sales.",

Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. Janssen Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson, owns patents specifically related to STELARA .

The latest expiring European composition of matter patent expires in 2024. \u00ae \u00ae\n\nSales of the Company's second largest product, collectively DARZALEX  (daratumumab) and DARZALEX FASPRO (daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj), accounted for approximately 6.4% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2021. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. Genmab A/S owns two patent families related to DARZALEX , and Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to those patent families.

Janssen Biotech, Inc. owns a separate patent portfolio related to DARZALEX FASPRO . \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\n## Trademarks\n\nThe Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the U.S. and other countries where such products are marketed. The Company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nWorldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and research and development activity.\n\n## Competition\n\nIn all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company's product portfolio, is important to the Company's success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Company's consumer products involve significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.\n\n## Environment\n\nThe Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and international environmental protection measures. The Company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Company's compliance with these requirements is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.\n\n## Regulation\n\nThe Company's businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation and enforcement. The Company is subject to costly and complex U.S. and foreign laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition and business operations. In the U.S., the drug, device and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the U.S. FDA) continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for U.S. FDA approval of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the U.S. The new medical device regulatory framework and the new privacy regulations in Europe and in other countries are examples of such increased regulation.\n\nThe regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, the Company's subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls.\n\nThe U.S. FDA and regulatory agencies around the globe are also increasing their enforcement activities. If the U.S. FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our drugs or medical",

      "answer": "AbbVie's cost of products sold includes Genentech's share of pre-tax profits and losses from Venclexta in the U.S., as well as royalties on net revenues outside the U.S. However, since the Phase 3 CANOVA study did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) for Venclexta plus dexamethasone in t(11;14)-positive R/R multiple myeloma, the commercial prospects of Venclexta in this indication are uncertain. This lack of statistical significance may negatively impact future revenues from Venclexta in this specific biomarker-driven subset, which in turn would affect the overall profitability shared with Genentech and thus influence AbbVie's cost of products sold.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, extract that the Phase 3 CANOVA study for Venclexta in t(11;14)-positive R/R multiple myeloma did not demonstrate statistically significant improvement in PFS.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize that the lack of statistically significant PFS improvement from the CANOVA study likely limits Venclexta's commercial potential in this indication, which affects the shared profitability and thus AbbVie\u2019s cost of products sold."

      "question": "Considering the impact of increased co-pay expenses and Medicare price setting timelines, by how much could AMGN's revenue from Otezla and ENBREL be affected starting in 2025 and 2026 respectively, and how does this reflect a pattern in the company's revenue forecasting for its key drugs?",
      "answer": "AMGN's Otezla revenue is expected to face lower first-quarter sales in 2025 due to increased co-pay expenses and benefit plan changes, following a historical pattern. ENBREL will also see continued declines in net selling price starting in 2026 due to Medicare Part D pricing under the Inflation Reduction Act. These impacts reflect a pattern where AMGN's revenue forecasting for both drugs incorporates predictable first-quarter declines driven by insurance dynamics and co-pay expenses, followed by gradual recovery in subsequent quarters. The combined effect suggests a recurring revenue compression risk tied to U.S. patient deductibles and regulatory-driven pricing.",

          "chunk_text": "years such that, by 2031, approximately 100 drugs could be subject to such set prices). The Medicare price setting process for the first 10 drugs subject to Medicare price setting in Part D began in 2023 , which includes ENBREL, our product that currently generates considerable revenues. In 2024, CMS set a price for ENBREL under Medicare Part D that is significantly lower than currently applicable, beginning on January 1, 2026, which we expect will negatively impact its profitability in Medicare. See Part I, Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of operations-Product sales-ENBREL. In January 2025, CMS announced the next 15 drugs for Medicare price setting that will be applicable beginning on January 1, 2027, which includes Otezla. Depending on the growth and success of our medicines, other of our medicines may also be subject to selection by CMS in the next, or in a future, cycle of mandatory Medicare price setting. If other of our medicines are selected by CMS for Medicare price setting, we may be required to accept a price set by the government for Medicare similar to the process that was applied to ENBREL. Also under the IRA, Medicare Part D was redesigned to cap beneficiary out-of-pocket costs and, beginning January 1, 2025, Federal reinsurance  will  be  reduced  in  the  catastrophic  phase  (resulting  in  a  shift  and  increase  of  such  costs  to  Part  D  plans  and  manufacturers,  including  by  requiring manufacturer discounts on certain drugs). Further, the IRA inflation penalties allows CMS to collect rebates from manufacturers if price increases outpace inflation. Such rebate obligations began to accrue October 1, 2022 for Medicare Part D and January 1, 2023 for Medicare Part B, but CMS has not yet issued invoices and has some discretion as to when to issue such invoices to manufacturers. We expect that several of our products will be subject to IRA inflation penalties, and several of our products have been on lists that are issued and updated on a quarterly basis by CMS under a related program under which Medicare beneficiaries are charged reduced coinsurance if price increases exceed inflation. The IRA's Medicare price setting and Medicare redesign are likely to have a material adverse effect on our sales, our business and our results of operations, and such impact is expected to increase through the end of the decade and will depend on factors including the extent of our portfolio's ex posure to Medicare reimbursement, the rate of inflation over time, the number of our products selected for Medicare price setting and the timing of market entry of generic or biosimilar competition. Further, following the enactment of the IRA, the environment remains dynamic and U.S. policymakers continue to demonstrate interest  in  health  care  and  drug  pricing  changes.  For  ex ample,  in April  2024,  CMS  finalized  policy  changes  that  will  give  Part  D  plans  more  flex ibility  to  substitute biosimilars for innovator products on formularies in 2025. Additionally, various government agencies have taken actions designed to reduce expenditures on prescription drugs. For example, HHS released a report with drug pricing proposals that seek to promote competition. The USPTO has also taken steps to strengthen coordination with the FDA to address perceived impediments to generic drug and biosimilar competition. Other CMS policy changes and demonstration projects to test new care, delivery and payment models can also significantly affect how drugs, including our products, are covered and reimbursed.\n\nWe also face risks related to the reporting of pricing data that affects reimbursement of and discounts provided for our products. U.S. government price reporting regulations are complex and may require biopharmaceutical manufacturers to update certain previously submitted data. If our submitted pricing data are incorrect, we may become subject to substantial fines and penalties or other government enforcement actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, as a result of restating previously reported price data, we may be required to pay additional rebates and provide additional discounts.\n\n-Changing reimbursement and pricing actions in various states have negatively affected, and may continue to negatively affect, access to, and have affected, and may continue to affect, sales of our products\n\nAt the state level, legislation, government actions, and ballot initiatives can also affect how our products are covered and reimbursed and/or create additional pressure on our pricing decisions. Existing and proposed state pricing laws have added complexity to the pricing of drugs and may already be affecting industry pricing decisions. A number of states have adopted, and many other states are considering, PDABs, drug importation programs, reference pricing schemes, and other drug pricing actions, including proposals designed to require biopharmaceutical manufacturers to report to the state proprietary pricing information or provide advance notice of certain price increases.\n\nStates are also enacting laws referencing the IRA and seeking to regulate and prohibit restrictions on the 340B Program. For example, following the passage of the IRA, bills have been proposed in multiple states that would apply the drug price caps set by HHS for Medicare to drug prices in an individual state, and such references to  IRA  price  caps  have  also  been  included  in  PDAB  legislation.  For  Medicaid  patients,  states  have  established  a  Medicaid  drug  spending  cap  (New  Y ork)  and implemented  a  new  review  and  supplemental  rebate  negotiation  process  (Massachusetts).  Eight  states  (Colorado,  Maine,  New  Hampshire,  New  Jersey,  Maryland, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington) have enacted laws that establish PDABs to identify drugs that pose affordability challenges, and four such states include authority for the state PDABs to set upper payment limits on certain drugs for in-state patients, payers and providers. In 2024, no fewer than 17 states introduced PDAB legislation. The eight states with enacted PDAB laws are in various phases of implementation, with Colorado's PDAB being the furthest along. The Colorado PDAB deemed three of five drugs 'unaffordable,' including ENBREL, and are subject to rulemaking to establish an Upper Payment Limit (UPL) commencing March 2025 and that could be effective as soon as the fourth quarter of 2025. Further, inappropriate ex panded utilization of the 340B Program from broadened application of the 340B discounts has had, and is",

TEPEZZA  and  KRY STEXXA  may  face  competition  from competitor medicines currently in clinical trials. See TEPEZZA and KRYSTEXXA sections above and Government Regulation-Regulation of Orphan Medicines .\n\n## Reimbursement\n\nSales of our products are dependent on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. In many markets around the world, these payers, including government health systems, private health insurers and other organizations, remain focused on reducing the cost of healthcare; and their efforts have intensified, in part, as a result of uncertain macroeconomic conditions, rising healthcare costs and pressures on healthcare budgets. Drugs remain heavily scrutinized for cost containment. As a result, payers have been and continue to be more restrictive regarding the use of biopharmaceutical products and are scrutinizing the prices of these products while requiring a higher level of clinical evidence to support the benefits such products bring to patients and the broader healthcare system. For example, as discussed below, payers are increasingly using stricter utilization management criteria, such as prior authorization and step therapy, to contain or reduce costs. These pressures become intensified when our products become subject to competition, including from biosimilars.\n\nIn the United States, healthcare providers and other entities such as pharmacies and PBMs are reimbursed for covered services and products they deliver through both private-payer and government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. We provide negotiated rebates or discounts to healthcare providers, private payers, government payers and PBMs. In addition, we are required to (i) provide rebates or discounts on our products that are reimbursed through certain government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and (ii) provide discounts to qualifying healthcare providers under the 340B Program. Further, inappropriate expanded utilization of the 340B Program has had a negative impact on the Company's financial performance.\n\nBoth  private  and  some  government  payers  use  formularies  to  manage  access  to  and  utilization  of  drugs. A  drug's  inclusion  and  favorable  positioning  on  a formulary are essential to ensure patients have full access to a particular drug. Even when access is available, some patients abandon their prescriptions for economic reasons. Payers continue to institute cost reduction and containment measures that lower drug utilization and/or spending altogether and/or shift a greater portion of the costs to patients. Such measures include, but are not limited to, more-limited benefit plan designs, higher patient co-pays or coinsurance obligations, limitations on patients' use of commercial manufacturer co-pay payment assistance programs (including through co-pay accumulator adjustment or maximization programs), stricter utilization management criteria (such as prior authorization and step therapy) before a patient may get access to a drug, higher-tier formulary placement that increases the level of patient out-of-pocket costs and formulary exclusion, which effectively encourages patients and providers to seek alternative treatments or pay 100% of the cost of a drug. The use of such measures by PBMs and insurers has continued to intensify and has thereby limited Amgen product usage and sales. Furthermore, in the United States, the top six integrated health plans and PBMs controlled about 94% of all pharmacy prescriptions. As a result, PBMs and insurers have greater market power and negotiating leverage to mandate stricter utilization criteria and/or ex clude drugs from their formularies in favor of competitor drugs or alternative treatments. In highly competitive treatment markets such as the markets for ENBREL, Otezla, Repatha and Aimovig, PBMs are also able to exert negotiating leverage by requiring incremental rebates from manufacturers in order for them to gain and/or maintain their formulary position.\n\nIn addition to market actions taken by private and government payers in the United States, policy makers in both of the major U.S. political parties have supported policies to lower drug costs. See Item 1A. Risk FactorsOur sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our profitability .  For ex ample, in 2022, the IRA was enacted and includes provisions requiring that beginning in 2026, mandatory price setting be introduced in Medicare for certain drugs paid for under Parts B and D, whereby manufacturers must accept a price established by the government or face penalties on all U.S. sales (starting with 10 drugs in 2026, adding 15 in 2027 and 2028, and adding 20 in 2029 and subsequent years such that by 2031 approximately 100 drugs could be subject to such set prices). The Medicare price setting process began in August 2023 when CMS announced the first 10 drugs for Medicare price setting, which includes ENBREL, currently a product that generates considerable revenue for the Company. On July 30, 2024, CMS set a price for ENBREL in Medicare Part D that is significantly lower than the currently applicable price, effective beginning on January 1, 2026. We expect this will negatively impact",

      "answer": "The $431 million goodwill impairment charge for the LTC reporting unit in 2021 was determined using a combination of the discounted cash flow method and the market multiple method. These valuation techniques revealed that the LTC reporting unit's fair value was lower than its carrying value, primarily due to deteriorating financial forecasts driven by lower net facility admissions, customer losses, and the prolonged impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Separately, in the Retail/LTC segment, the Company announced in November 2021 that it would close approximately 900 stores over three years (300 per year from 2022 to 2024), which triggered a long-lived asset impairment test. This led to a $1.4 billion store impairment charge in Q4 2021, including $1.1 billion for operating lease right-of-use assets and $261 million for property and equipment, also within the Retail/LTC segment.",

          "chunk_text": "regularly opens or closes stores to align with its operating strategy. Generally, the renewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. Similarly, renewal options are not included in the lease term for non-real estate leases because they are not considered reasonably certain of being exercised at lease commencement. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets, and lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the short-term lease.\n\nFor real estate leases, the Company accounts for lease components and nonlease components as a single lease component. Certain real estate leases require additional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs. Other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. These fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.\n\n## Long-Lived Asset Impairment\n\n## Recoverability of Definite-Lived Assets\n\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are tested for impairment using separate tests described below, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable. The Company groups and evaluates these long-lived assets for impairment at the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified. If indicators of impairment are present, the Company first compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group (undiscounted). If the estimated future cash flows used in this analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group's estimated future cash flows (discounted). If required, an impairment loss is recorded for the portion of the asset group's carrying value that exceeds the asset group's estimated future cash flows (discounted).\n\nThe long-lived asset impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate each asset group's future sales, profitability and cash flows. When preparing these estimates, the Company considers historical results and current operating trends and consolidated sales, profitability and cash flow results and forecasts. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including general economic and regulatory conditions, efforts of third party organizations to reduce their prescription drug costs and/or increased member co-payments, the continued efforts of competitors to gain market share and consumer spending patterns.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company completed a strategic review of its retail business and announced the creation of new formats for its stores to continue to drive higher engagement with customers. As part of this review, the Company evaluated changes in population, consumer buying patterns and future health needs to ensure it has the right kinds of stores in the right locations for consumers and for the business. In connection with this initiative, on November 17, 2021, the Board of Directors of CVS Health Corporation (the 'Board') authorized the closing of approximately 900 stores over the next three years. The Company expects to close approximately 300 stores each year between 2022 and 2024. As a result, management determined that there were indicators of impairment with respect to the impacted stores' asset groups, including the associated operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment. A long-lived asset impairment test was performed during the fourth quarter of 2021 and the results of the impairment test indicated that the fair value of certain retail store asset groups were lower than their respective carrying values. Accordingly, in the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a store impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion, consisting of a write down of approximately $1.1 billion related to operating lease right-of-use assets and $261 million related to property and equipment, within the Retail/LTC segment.\n\nThere were no material impairment charges recognized on long-lived assets in the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded store impairment charges of $231 million, primarily related to operating lease right-of-use asset impairment charges.\n\n## Recoverability of Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of amounts paid for acquisitions over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment reviews, or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment on a reporting unit basis. The impairment test is performed by comparing the reporting unit's fair value with its net book value (or carrying amount), including goodwill. The fair value of the reporting units is estimated using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. If the net book value (carrying amount) of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the reporting unit's goodwill is considered to be impaired, and an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.",

          "chunk_text": "\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the decrease in the carrying amount of goodwill was primarily driven by a goodwill impairment charge related to the LTC reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the decrease in the carrying amount of goodwill was primarily driven by the divestiture of the Workers' Compensation business, partially offset by goodwill associated with immaterial acquisitions. See Note 2 ''Divestitures'' for further discussion regarding the Workers' Compensation business divestiture.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, the Company performed its required annual impairment tests of goodwill. The results of the impairment tests indicated an impairment of the goodwill associated with the LTC reporting unit, as the reporting unit's carrying value exceeded its fair value as of the testing date. The results of the impairment tests of the remaining reporting units indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill as of the testing date.\n\nDuring 2021, the LTC reporting unit has continued to face challenges that have impacted the Company's ability to grow the LTC reporting unit's business at the rate estimated when its 2020 goodwill impairment test was performed. These challenges include lower net facility admissions, net long-term care facility customer losses and the prolonged adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the emerging new variants, which resulted in more significant declines in occupancy rates experienced by the Company's long-term care facility customers than previously anticipated. During the third quarter of 2021, LTC management updated their 2021 annual forecast and submitted their long-term plan which showed deterioration in the financial results for the remainder of 2021 and beyond. The Company utilized these updated projections in performing its annual impairment test, which indicated that the fair value of the LTC reporting unit was lower than its carrying value, resulting in a $431 million goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter of 2021. The fair value of the LTC reporting unit was determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. As of December 31, 2021, there was no remaining goodwill balance in the LTC reporting unit. During the third quarter of 2021, the Company also performed an impairment test of the intangible assets of the LTC reporting unit and concluded these assets were not impaired. As of December 31, 2021, there was $2.7 billion of intangible assets related to customer lists in the LTC reporting unit.",

      "answer": "The changes in ExtraBucks Rewards and gift card liabilities during 2021 directly affected CVS's revenue recognition by reducing the contract liability balance as customers redeemed rewards and gift cards. Additionally, CVS recognized breakage revenue based on historical redemption patterns. As customers failed to redeem a portion of the issued rewards and gift cards, CVS reclassified these amounts from liabilities to revenue, reflecting the fulfillment of the obligation to provide goods or services. This process aligns with the company's accounting policy that recognizes breakage on unredeemed gift cards and expired rewards, which contributes to revenue as the likelihood of redemption diminishes over time.",

Downgrades in our ratings could adversely affect our businesses, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n## Goodwill and other intangible assets could, in the future, become impaired.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we had $108.1 billion and $110.7 billion, respectively, of goodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment reviews, or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When evaluating goodwill for potential impairment, we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their respective carrying amounts. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess to the extent of the goodwill balance. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. The Company estimates the fair value of its indefinite-lived trademarks using the relief from royalty method under the income approach. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized, and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. Definite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable. If indicators of impairment are present, the Company first compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group (undiscounted). If the estimated future cash flows used in this analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group's estimated future cash flows (discounted).\n\nEstimated fair values could change if, for example, there are changes in the business climate, industry-wide changes, changes in the competitive environment, adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments, changes in capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditure levels, operating cash flows or market capitalization. Because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could require material noncash charges to our operating results, which also could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\n\nAdverse conditions in the U.S. and global capital markets can significantly and adversely affect the value of our investments in debt and equity securities, mortgage loans, alternative investments and other investments, and our operating results and/or our financial condition.\n\nThe global capital markets, including credit markets, continue to experience volatility and uncertainty. As an insurer, we have a substantial investment portfolio that supports our policy liabilities and surplus and is comprised largely of debt securities of issuers located in the U.S. As a result, the income we earn from our investment portfolio is largely driven by the level of interest rates in the U.S., and to a lesser extent the international financial markets; and volatility, uncertainty and/or disruptions in the global capital markets, particularly the U.S. credit markets, and governments' monetary policy, particularly U.S. monetary policy, can significantly and adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio, our operating results and/or our financial condition by:\n\n- significantly reducing the value and/or liquidity of the debt securities we hold in our investment portfolio and creating realized capital losses that reduce our operating results and/or unrealized capital losses that reduce our shareholders' equity;\n- keeping interest rates low on high-quality short-term or medium-term debt securities (such as we have experienced during recent years) and thereby materially reducing our net investment income and operating results as the proceeds from securities in our investment portfolio that mature or are otherwise disposed of continue to be reinvested in lower yielding securities;\n- reducing the fair values of our investments if interest rates rise;\n- causing non-performance of or defaults on their obligations to us by third parties, including customers, issuers of securities in our investment portfolio, mortgage borrowers and/or reinsurance and/or derivatives counterparties;\n- making it more difficult to value certain of our investment securities, for example if trading becomes less frequent, which could lead to significant period-to-period changes in our estimates of the fair values of those securities and cause period-toperiod volatility in our net income and shareholders' equity;",

          "chunk_text": "\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the decrease in the carrying amount of goodwill was primarily driven by a goodwill impairment charge related to the LTC reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the decrease in the carrying amount of goodwill was primarily driven by the divestiture of the Workers' Compensation business, partially offset by goodwill associated with immaterial acquisitions. See Note 2 ''Divestitures'' for further discussion regarding the Workers' Compensation business divestiture.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, the Company performed its required annual impairment tests of goodwill. The results of the impairment tests indicated an impairment of the goodwill associated with the LTC reporting unit, as the reporting unit's carrying value exceeded its fair value as of the testing date. The results of the impairment tests of the remaining reporting units indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill as of the testing date.\n\nDuring 2021, the LTC reporting unit has continued to face challenges that have impacted the Company's ability to grow the LTC reporting unit's business at the rate estimated when its 2020 goodwill impairment test was performed. These challenges include lower net facility admissions, net long-term care facility customer losses and the prolonged adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the emerging new variants, which resulted in more significant declines in occupancy rates experienced by the Company's long-term care facility customers than previously anticipated. During the third quarter of 2021, LTC management updated their 2021 annual forecast and submitted their long-term plan which showed deterioration in the financial results for the remainder of 2021 and beyond. The Company utilized these updated projections in performing its annual impairment test, which indicated that the fair value of the LTC reporting unit was lower than its carrying value, resulting in a $431 million goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter of 2021. The fair value of the LTC reporting unit was determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. As of December 31, 2021, there was no remaining goodwill balance in the LTC reporting unit. During the third quarter of 2021, the Company also performed an impairment test of the intangible assets of the LTC reporting unit and concluded these assets were not impaired. As of December 31, 2021, there was $2.7 billion of intangible assets related to customer lists in the LTC reporting unit.",

      "answer": "Pfizer received $51 million in cash from the sale of Meridian in 2021 and recognized a $167 million loss from the transaction, which was recorded in Discontinued operations\u2014net of tax. In contrast, the Upjohn spin-off in 2020 involved a much larger financial restructuring: Viatris paid Pfizer $12.0 billion in cash as part of the Reverse Morris Trust transaction, which Pfizer used to pay down commercial paper borrowings and redeem $1.492 billion in senior unsecured notes. The Upjohn transaction also resulted in Pfizer distributing $1.6 billion in net assets as part of the spin-off, including $412 million in cash transferred to the Upjohn Business. While the Meridian divestiture had a minimal cash inflow and a negative impact due to the loss, the Upjohn spin-off significantly affected Pfizer\u2019s capital structure by reducing debt and providing a substantial cash infusion, illustrating a strategic shift toward focusing on core growth areas.",

        "Step 4: From evidence_source_b, confirm that both Meridian and the Upjohn Business are treated as discontinued operations, indicating their strategic removal from Pfizer\u2019s core operations.",
        "Step 5: Synthesize the relative financial impacts: Meridian contributed a small cash inflow but with a significant loss, while Upjohn provided a large cash inflow that directly supported Pfizer\u2019s debt reduction and capital restructuring."

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nArray's portfolio includes Braftovi (encorafenib) and Mektovi (binimetinib), a broad pipeline of targeted cancer medicines in different stages of R&amp;D, as well as a portfolio of out-licensed medicines, which may generate milestones and royalties over time.\n\nThe final allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed was completed in 2020. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded: (i) $6.3 billion in Identifiable intangible assets , consisting of $2.0 billion of Developed technology rights with a useful life of 16 years, $2.8 billion of IPR&amp;D and $1.5 billion of Licensing agreements and other ($1.2 billion for technology in development --indefinite-lived licensing agreements and $360 million for developed technology --finite-lived licensing agreements with a useful life of 10 years), (ii) $6.1 billion of Goodwill , (iii) $1.1 billion of net deferred tax liabilities and (iv) $451 million of assumed long-term debt, which was paid in full in 2019.\n\nIn 2020, we recorded measurement period adjustments to the estimated fair values initially recorded in 2019, which resulted in a reduction in Identifiable intangible assets of approximately $900 million with a corresponding change to Goodwill and net deferred tax liabilities. The measurement period adjustments were recorded to better reflect market participant assumptions about facts and circumstances existing as of the acquisition date and did not have a material impact on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\n## Therachon\n\nOn July 1, 2019, we acquired all the remaining shares of Therachon, a privately-held clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on rare diseases, with assets in development for the treatment of achondroplasia, a genetic condition and the most common form of short-limb dwarfism, for $340 million upfront, plus potential milestone payments of up to $470 million contingent on the achievement of key milestones in the development and commercialization of the lead asset. We accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since the lead asset represented substantially all the fair value of the gross assets acquired. The total fair value of the consideration transferred for Therachon was $322 million, which consisted of $317 million of cash and our previous $5 million investment in Therachon. In connection with this asset acquisition, we recorded a charge of $337 million in Research and development expenses.\n\n## B. Divestitures\n\n## Meridian\n\nOn December 31, 2021, we completed the sale of our Meridian subsidiary for approximately $51 million in cash and recognized a loss of approximately $167 million, net of tax, in Discontinued operations--net of tax . In connection with the sale, Pfizer and the purchaser of Meridian entered into various agreements to provide a framework for our relationship after the sale, including interim TSAs and a manufacturing supply agreement (MSA). The TSAs primarily involve Pfizer providing services related to information technology, among other activities, and are generally expected to be for terms of no more than 12 to 18 months post sale. The MSA is for a term of three years post sale with a two year extension period. No amounts were recorded under the above arrangements in 2021.\n\n## Upjohn Separation and Combination with Mylan\n\nOn November 16, 2020, we completed the spin-off and the combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan (the Transactions) to form Viatris.\n\nThe Transactions were structured as an all-stock, Reverse Morris Trust transaction. Specifically, (i) we contributed the Upjohn Business to a wholly owned subsidiary, which was renamed Viatris, so that the Upjohn Business was separated from the remainder of our business (the Separation), (ii) following the Separation, we distributed, on a pro rata basis, all of the shares of Viatris common stock held by Pfizer to Pfizer stockholders as of the November 13, 2020 record date, such that each Pfizer stockholder as of the record date received approximately 0.124079 shares of Viatris common stock per share of Pfizer common stock (the Distribution); and (iii) immediately after the Distribution, the Upjohn Business combined with Mylan in a series of transactions in which Mylan shareholders received one share of Viatris common stock for each Mylan ordinary share held by such shareholder, subject to any applicable withholding taxes (the Combination). Prior to the Distribution, Viatris made a cash payment to Pfizer equal to $12.0 billion as partial consideration for the contribution of the Upjohn Business to Viatris. As of the closing of the Combination, Pfizer stockholders owned approximately 57% of the outstanding shares of Viatris common stock, and Mylan shareholders owned approximately 43% of the outstanding shares of Viatris common stock, in each case on a fully diluted, as-converted and as-exercised basis. The Transactions are generally expected to be tax free to Pfizer and Pfizer stockholders for U.S. tax purposes. Beginning November 16, 2020, Viatris operates both the Upjohn Business and Mylan as an independent publicly traded company, which is traded under the symbol 'VTRS' on the NASDAQ.\n\nIn connection with the Transactions, in June 2020, Upjohn Inc. and Upjohn Finance B.V. completed privately placed debt offerings of $7.45 billion and \u20ac3.60 billion aggregate principal amounts, respectively, (approximately $11.4 billion) of senior unsecured notes and entered into other financing arrangements, including a $600 million delayed draw term loan agreement and a revolving credit facility agreement for up to $4.0 billion. Proceeds from the debt offerings and other financing arrangements were used to fund the $12.0 billion cash distribution Viatris made to Pfizer prior to the Distribution. We used the cash distribution proceeds to pay down commercial paper borrowings and redeem the $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 1.95% senior unsecured notes that were due in June 2021 and $342 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 5.80% senior unsecured notes that were due in August 2023, before the maturity date. Interest expense for the $11.4 billion in debt securities incurred during 2020 is included in Discontinued operations--net of tax . Following the Separation and Combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan, we are no longer the obligor or guarantor of any Upjohn debt or Upjohn financing arrangements.\n\nAs a result of the spin-off of the Upjohn Business, we distributed net assets of $1.6 billion as of November 16, 2020, which was reflected as a reduction to Retained earnings and reflects the change in accounting principle in the first quarter of 2021 to MTM Accounting. See Note 1C. Of this amount, $412 million represents cash transferred to the Upjohn Business, with the remainder considered a non-cash activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020. The spin-off also resulted in a net increase to Accumulated other comprehensive loss of $423 million for the derecognition of net gains on foreign currency translation adjustments of $397 million and prior service net credits associated with benefit plans of $26 million, which were reclassified to Retained earnings .\n\nAs a result of the separation of Upjohn, we incurred separation-related costs of $434 million in 2020 and $83 million in 2019, which are included in Discontinued operations--net of tax . These costs primarily relate to professional fees for regulatory filings and separation activities within finance, tax, legal and information system functions as well as investment banking fees.\n\nPfizer Inc.",

The total variable lease payments for the same period were $1,087 million ($326 million in 2019 + $380 million in 2020 + $381 million in 2021).

(a)\n\nOur remaining share-purchase authorization was approximately $5.3 billion at December 31, 2021.\n\n## B. Preferred Stock and Employee Stock Ownership Plans\n\nPrior to May 4, 2020, we had outstanding Series A convertible perpetual preferred stock (the Series A Preferred Stock) that was held by an ESOP trust (the Trust). All outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock were converted, at the direction of the independent fiduciary under the Trust and in accordance with the certificate of designations for the Series A Preferred Stock, into shares of our common stock on May 4, 2020. The Trust received an aggregate of 1,070,369 shares of our common stock upon conversion, with zero shares of Series A Preferred Stock remaining outstanding as a result of the conversion. In December 2020, we filed a certificate of elimination and a restated certificate of incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State, which eliminated the Series A Preferred Stock.\n\nSince May 4, 2020, we have one ESOP that holds common stock of the Company (Common ESOP). As of December 31, 2021, all shares of common stock held by the Common ESOP have been allocated to the Pfizer U.S. defined contribution plan participants. The compensation cost related to the Common ESOP was $19 million in 2021, $19 million in 2020 and $20 million in 2019.\n\n## Note 13. Share-Based Payments\n\nOur compensation programs can include share-based payment awards with value that is determined by reference to the fair value of our shares and that provide for the grant of shares or options to acquire shares or similar arrangements. Our share-based awards are designed based on competitive survey data or industry peer groups used for compensation purposes, and are allocated between different long-term incentive awards, generally in the form of Total Shareholder Return Units (TSRUs), Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), Portfolio Performance Shares (PPSs), Performance Share Awards (PSAs), Breakthrough Performance Awards (BPAs) and Stock Options, as determined by the Compensation Committee.\n\nThe 2019 Stock Plan (2019 Plan) replaced and superseded the 2014 Plan. It provides for 400 million shares, in addition to shares remaining under the 2014 Plan, to be authorized for grants. The 2019 Plan provides that the number of stock options, TSRUs, RSUs, or performance-based awards that may be granted to any one individual during any 36-month period is limited to 20 million shares, and that RSUs count as three shares, PPSs, PSAs and BPAs count as three shares times the maximum potential payout, while TSRUs and stock options count as one share, toward the maximum shares available under the 2019 Plan. As of December 31, 2021, 315 million shares were available for award. Although not required to do so, we have used authorized and unissued shares and, to a lesser extent, treasury stock to satisfy our obligations under these programs.\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n89",

(a)\n\nAllocated shares held by the Common ESOP, including reinvested dividends, are considered outstanding for EPS calculations and the eventual conversion of allocated preferred shares held by the Preferred ESOP was assumed in the diluted EPS calculation until the conversion date, which occurred in May 2020. See Note 12 .\n\n## Note 15. Leases\n\nWe lease real estate, fleet, and equipment for use in our operations. Our leases generally have lease terms of 1 to 30 years, some of which include options to terminate or extend leases for up to 5 to 10 years or on a month-to-month basis. We include options that are reasonably certain to be exercised as part of the determination of lease terms. We may negotiate termination clauses in anticipation of any changes in market conditions, but generally these termination options have not been exercised. Residual value guarantees are generally not included within our operating leases with the exception of some fleet leases. In addition to base rent payments, the leases may require us to pay directly for taxes and other non-lease components, such as insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses, which may be dependent on usage or vary month-to-month. Variable lease payments amounted to $381 million in 2021, $380 million in 2020 and $326 million in 2019. We elected the practical expedient to not separate non-lease components from lease components in calculating the amounts of ROU assets and lease liabilities for all underlying asset classes.\n\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the contract and we perform the lease classification test as of the lease commencement date. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of future payments.\n\nFor operating leases, the ROU assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets follows:\n\n",

See the Item 1. Business -Research and Development section of this Form 10-K for our R&amp;D priorities and strategy. We seek to leverage a strong pipeline, organize around expected operational growth drivers and capitalize on trends creating long-term growth opportunities, including:\n\n- an aging global population that is generating increased demand for innovative medicines and vaccines that address patients' unmet needs;\n- advances in both biological science and digital technology that are enhancing the delivery of breakthrough new medicines and vaccines; and\n- the increasingly significant role of hospitals in healthcare systems.\n\n## Our Business Development Initiatives\n\nWe are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product pipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various business development activities. We view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies and seek to generate growth by pursuing opportunities and transactions that have the potential to strengthen our business and our capabilities. We assess our business, assets and scientific capabilities/portfolio as part of our regular, ongoing portfolio review process and also continue to consider business development activities that will help advance our business strategy.\n\nOur significant recent business development activities that closed or are targeted to close in 2022 include:\n\n## Acquisition of Arena\n\nIn December 2021, we and Arena announced that the companies entered into a definitive agreement under which we will acquire Arena, a clinical stage company developing innovative potential therapies for the treatment of several immuno-inflammatory diseases. Under the terms of the agreement, we will acquire all outstanding shares of Arena for $100 per share in an all-cash transaction for a total equity value of approximately $6.7 billion. On February 2, 2022, Arena shareholders voted to approve the proposed acquisition, which is targeted to close in the first half of 2022, subject to review under antitrust laws and other customary closing conditions.\n\n## Collaboration with Biohaven\n\nIn November 2021, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement and related sublicense agreement with Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd., Biohaven Pharmaceutical Ireland DAC and BioShin Limited (collectively, Biohaven) pursuant to which we acquired rights to commercialize rimegepant and zavegepant for the treatment and prevention of migraines outside of the U.S., subject to regulatory approval. Rimegepant is currently commercialized in the U.S., Israel, and the U.A.E. under the brand name Nurtec ODT, with certain additional applications pending outside of the U.S. Biohaven will continue to lead R&amp;D globally and we have the exclusive right to commercialization globally, outside of the U.S. Upon the closing of the transaction, which occurred on January 4, 2022, we paid Biohaven $500 million, including an upfront payment of $150 million and an equity investment of $350 million. Biohaven is also eligible to receive up to $740 million in non-U.S. commercialization milestone payments, in addition to tiered double-digit royalties on net sales outside of the U.S. In addition to the milestone payments and royalties above, we will also reimburse Biohaven for the portion of certain additional milestone payments and royalties due to third parties in accordance with preexisting Biohaven agreements, which are attributed to exU.S. sales. \u00ae\n\nFor additional information, including discussion of recent significant business development activities, see Note 2 .\n\n## Our 2021 Performance\n\n## Revenues\n\nRevenues increased $39.6 billion, or 95%, to $81.3 billion in 2021 from $41.7 billion in 2020, reflecting an operational increase of $38.4 billion, or 92%, as well as a favorable impact of foreign exchange of $1.2 billion, or 3%. Excluding direct sales and alliance revenues of Comirnaty and sales of Paxlovid, revenues increased 6% operationally, reflecting strong growth in Eliquis, Biosimilars, PC1, Vyndaqel/Vyndamax, the Hospital therapeutic area, Inlyta and Xtandi, partially offset by declines in the Prevnar family, Chantix/Champix, Enbrel and Sutent.\n\nThe following outlines the components of the net change in revenues:\n\nSee the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income--Revenues by Geography and Revenues--Selected Product Discussion sections within MD&amp;A for more information, including a discussion of key drivers of our revenue performance.

The fourth quarter includes a $2.1 billion charge for IPR&amp;D expense associated with the acquisition of Trillium, as well as other upfront and milestone payments on collaboration and licensing arrangements. See Notes 2A, D and E. (b)\n\nThe third and fourth quarters of 2021 primarily include employee termination costs associated with our Transforming to a More Focused Company program. See Note 3. (c)\n\nAll periods reflect a change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings primarily related to Comirnaty. The third quarter of 2021 reflects benefits resulting from certain initiatives executed in the third quarter of 2021 associated with our investment in the Consumer Healthcare JV with GSK. See Note 5A. (d)\n\nAll periods include the operating results of Meridian prior to its sale on December 31, 2021 and to a lesser extent post-closing adjustments directly related to prior discontinued businesses. The second quarter of 2021 includes a pre-tax charge of $345 million to resolve a legal matter related to Meridian and the fourth quarter of 2021 includes an after tax loss of $167 million related to the sale of Meridian. See Note 2B. (e)\n\nBasic and diluted EPS are computed independently for each of the periods presented. Accordingly, the sum of the quarterly EPS amounts may not agree to the total for the year.\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n106",

      "answer": "The estimated maximum potential decrease in Pfizer's gross unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months is $75 million. This uncertainty is influenced by the fact that the IRS has issued Revenue Agent's Reports (RARs) for tax years 2011\u20132013 and 2014\u20132015, which Pfizer is currently appealing. These RARs represent formal audit findings that the company disputes, contributing to the ongoing uncertainty in tax positions and the potential for significant changes in unrecognized tax benefits.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Pfizer estimates that it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months, its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by as much as $75 million due to settlements or statute expirations.",

In 2021 and 2020, these amounts were substantially all included in Other taxes payable. Accrued penalties are not significant. See also Note 5A.\n\n## Status of Tax Audits and Potential Impact on Accruals for Uncertain Tax Positions\n\nThe U.S. is one of our major tax jurisdictions, and we are regularly audited by the IRS. With respect to Pfizer, the IRS has issued Revenue Agent's Reports (RARs) for tax years 2011-2013 and 2014-2015. We are not in agreement with the RARs and are currently appealing certain disputed issues. Tax years 2016-2018 are currently under audit. Tax years 2019-2021 are open, but not under audit. All other tax years are closed. In addition to the open audit years in the U.S., we have open audit years in certain major international tax jurisdictions such as Canada (2013-2021), Europe (2011-2021, primarily reflecting Ireland, the U.K., France, Italy, Spain and Germany), Asia Pacific (2011-2021, primarily reflecting China, Japan and Singapore) and Latin America (19982021, primarily reflecting Brazil).\n\nAny settlements or statutes of limitations expirations could result in a significant decrease in our uncertain tax positions. We estimate that it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months, our gross unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of interest, could decrease by as much as $75 million, as a result of settlements with taxing authorities or the expiration of the statutes of limitations. Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but our estimates of unrecognized tax benefits and potential tax benefits may not be representative of actual outcomes, and variation from such estimates could materially affect our financial statements in the period of settlement or when the statutes of limitations expire, as we treat these events as discrete items in the period of resolution. Finalizing audits with the relevant taxing authorities can include formal administrative and legal proceedings, and, as a result, it is difficult to estimate the timing and range of possible changes related to our uncertain tax positions, and such changes could be significant.\n\n## E.

Additionally, a $20 million credit to cost of product revenue, resulting from a change in the method of accounting for inventories, further improved the margin.

      "answer": "TMO's pharma services business significantly contributed to segment revenue and margin performance in 2021. The business experienced increased demand, particularly driven by its role in supporting customers with vaccine and therapy development during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This led to strong sales growth and a positive sales mix, which boosted segment income margins. Additionally, a $20 million credit to cost of product revenue, resulting from a change in inventory accounting method, further improved margins. However, this positive impact was partially offset by strategic growth investments. Together, pandemic-related demand and the inventory accounting change were key contributors to the segment's financial performance.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - TMO's pharma services business supported customers in vaccine and therapy development during the pandemic, with $9.23 billion in pandemic-related sales in 2021.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - The pharma services business was central to TMO's 2021 financial performance, with pandemic-related demand directly increasing sales and profitability, while the inventory accounting change provided a smaller but notable boost to margins."

However, as a result of the pandemic's impact on various markets, the company saw a significant reduction in customer activity in several businesses by late March 2020 that materially adversely affected primarily the 2020 results of the Analytical Instruments segment and, to a lesser extent, some businesses within the company's other three segments. The negative impact significantly lessened in 2021, but could worsen in 2022 dependent on the success of global efforts to control and unwind from the pandemic and economic activity ramping up. During 2021, the Life Sciences Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segments as well as the laboratory products business continued to support COVID-19 diagnostic testing, scaling and evolving their molecular diagnostics solutions and plastic consumables businesses to respond to the on-going COVID19 pandemic. The biosciences and bioproduction businesses also expanded their capacity to meet the needs of pharma and biotech customers as they rapidly expanded their own production volumes to meet global vaccine manufacturing requirements. Additionally, through our pharma services business, we provided our pharma and biotech customers with the services they needed to develop and produce vaccines and therapies globally. While these positive impacts are expected to continue through 2022, the duration and extent of future revenues from such sales are uncertain and dependent primarily on customer testing as well as therapy and vaccine demand. Sales of products related to COVID-19 response were $9.23 billion and $6.63 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nConditions were strong in each of the company's end markets during 2021. Revenues were particularly strong in pharma and biotech driven by strong market dynamics and the company's role in supporting customers across a wide range of therapeutic areas, including our role in supporting COVID-19 vaccines and therapies.

Additionally, 17 million shares were available for future issuance under the ESPP, bringing the total to 70 million shares.

Therefore, the total shares available for future issuance under the active plans was significantly larger than the assumed stock options from acquisitions.",

        "Step 2: From evidence_source_a, extract that 191,000 shares were underlying stock options assumed through acquisitions.",

      "answer": "UnitedHealth Group faced significant Medicare Advantage funding pressures in 2023, including industry base rate decreases and substantial revisions to the risk adjustment model, which reduced funding for plans serving members with greater health and social challenges. In response, the company intensified medical and operating cost management, adjusted member benefits, and selectively increased member premiums to offset these pressures. Simultaneously, the company decided to divest its operations in Brazil, recording a $7 billion loss in the first quarter of 2024, primarily due to foreign currency translation losses. This divestiture likely redirected capital and strategic focus toward core U.S. health care operations, reinforcing the company's ability to manage costs and adjust benefits under funding constraints.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - The financial impact of the Brazil divestiture and ongoing Medicare Advantage funding pressures led UnitedHealth Group to intensify cost management, adjust member benefits, and selectively increase premiums to maintain financial stability and strategic focus on core U.S. operations."

          "chunk_text": "## Alliances\n\nWe enter into alliance arrangements with third parties for the development and commercialization of specific products or drug candidates in our therapeutic areas of focus. Alliances may be structured as co-development, co-commercialization, licensing or joint venture arrangements.  These arrangements may include upfront payments;  option  payments  to  develop  or  commercialize  a  specific  asset  or  technology;  payments  for  various  developmental,  regulatory  and  sales-based performance milestones; royalties; cost reimbursements; profit sharing; and equity investments. Provisions in our alliance arrangements lessen our investment risk for compounds not leading to revenue generating products but reduce the profitability of marketed products due to profit sharing or royalty payments. We actively pursue such arrangements and view alliances as an important complement to our own discovery, development and commercialization activities.\n\nOur alliance arrangements contain customary early termination provisions following material breaches, bankruptcy or product safety concerns. Such arrangements also typically provide for termination by BMS without cause. The amount of notice required for early termination generally ranges from immediately upon notice to 180 days after receipt of notice. Termination immediately upon notice is generally available where the other party files a voluntary bankruptcy petition or if a material safety issue arises with a product such that the medical risk/benefit is incompatible with the welfare of patients to continue to develop or commercialize the product. Termination with a notice period is generally available where an involuntary bankruptcy petition has been filed and has not been dismissed, a material breach by a party has occurred and not been cured or where BMS terminates without cause. Sometimes, BMS's right to terminate without cause may only be exercisable after a specified period of time has elapsed after the alliance agreement is signed. Our alliances typically do not otherwise contain provisions that provide the other party the right to terminate the alliance.\n\nWe typically do not retain any rights to another party's product or intellectual property after an alliance terminates. The loss of rights to one or more products that are marketed and sold by us pursuant to an alliance could be material to our results of operations and the loss of cash flows caused by such loss of rights could be material to our financial condition and liquidity. Alliance agreements may be structured to terminate on specific dates, upon the product's patent expiration date or without an expiry date. Profit sharing payments typically have no expiration date while royalty payments typically cease upon loss of market exclusivity, including patent expiration.\n\nRefer to 'Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 3. Alliances' for further information on our most significant alliance agreements as well as other alliance agreements.\n\n## Marketing, Distribution and Customers\n\nWe promote the appropriate use of our products directly to healthcare professionals and organizations such as doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, pharmacists, technologists, hospitals, PBMs and MCOs. We also provide information about the appropriate use of our products to consumers in the U.S. through direct-to-consumer  print,  radio,  television  and  digital  advertising  and  promotion.  In  addition,  we  sponsor  general  advertising  to  educate  the  public  about  our innovative medical research and corporate mission.  For a discussion of the regulation of promotion and marketing of pharmaceuticals, refer to '-G overnment Regulation' below.\n\nThrough our field sales and medical organizations, we explain the risks and benefits of the approved uses of our products to medical professionals. We work to gain access for our products on formularies and reimbursement plans (lists of recommended or approved medicines and other products), including Medicare Part D plans, by providing information about the clinical profiles of our products. Our marketing and sales of prescription pharmaceuticals is limited to the approved uses of the particular product, but we continue to develop scientific data and other information about potential additional uses of our products and provide such information as scientific ex change at scientific congresses or we share information about our products in other appropriate ways, including the development of publications, or in response to unsolicited inquiries from doctors, other medical professionals and MCOs.\n\nOur operations include several marketing and sales organizations. Each product marketing organization is supported by a sales force, which is responsible for selling one or more products. We also have marketing organizations that focus on certain classes of customers such as managed care entities or certain types of marketing tools, such as digital or consumer communications. Our sales forces focus on communicating information about new approved products or uses, as well as approved uses of established products, and promotion to physicians is increasingly targeted at physician specialists who treat the patients in need of our medicines.",

Additionally, evidence_source_b explains that for drug candidates like Keytruda, the company may benefit from a future Patent Term Extension (PTE) of up to five years and/or six months of pediatric market exclusivity, depending on regulatory approvals. Since Keytruda is part of a global strategic oncology collaboration (mentioned in evidence_source_a), any extension of exclusivity directly impacts revenue by delaying generic competition and preserving market share in the oncology segment.

(1)\n\n## Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP\n\nIn 2020, M erck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP (Ridgeback), a closely held biotechnology company , entered into a collaboration agreement to develop Lagevrio (molnupiravir),  an  investigational  orally   av ailable  antiv iral  candidate  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  COV ID-19.  M erck  gained  ex clusiv e worldwide rights to develop and commercialize Lagevrio and related molecules. Following initial authorizations in certain markets in 2021, Lagevrio has since received multiple additional authorizations.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Ridgeback received an upfront payment and is eligible to receive future contingent payments dependent upon the achievement of certain developmental and regulatory approval milestones. The agreement also provides for M erck to reimburse Ridgeback for a portion of certain third-party contingent milestone payments and royalties on net sales, which is part of the profit-sharing calculation. M erck is the principal on sales transactions, recognizing sales and related costs, with profit-sharing amounts recorded within Cost of sales .

      "question": "How does Merck utilize both patent term extensions and regulatory exclusivity to maximize market protection for its biologic products, and what specific exclusivity durations are available in the U.S. for such products?",
      "answer": "Merck leverages both patent term extensions and regulatory exclusivity to extend market protection for its biologic products. In the U.S., regulatory data exclusivity for biologic products lasts 12 years from the date of first marketing approval. Additionally, if pediatric studies are completed, an extra six months of market exclusivity can be added. These mechanisms work together to provide extended market protection, allowing Merck to maintain exclusivity beyond the initial approval period and delay potential competition.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, identify the U.S. regulatory data exclusivity duration for biologic products: 'twelve years from first marketing approval.'",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\ndifferent regulatory frameworks further adds to the complexity that the Company faces with regard to data protection regulation.\n\nIn 2021, China passed the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) that aims to standardize the handling of personal information in China. The PIPL currently applies to the processing of personal information of natural persons in China, the processing of personal information outside China where the purpose is to provide products and services in China, and to analyze the activities of individuals in China. While similar to the GDPR, the PIPL contains unique requirements not found in the GDPR. The Company has developed and implemented comprehensive plans to ensure compliance with the PIPL, including plans relating to data localiz ation and cross-border transfers.\n\nAdditional  laws  and  regulations  enacted  in  Canada,  Europe,  A sia,  Latin  A merica,  the  M iddle  East  and  19  states  in  the  U.S.  have  increased enforcement and litigation activity in the U.S. and other developed markets, as well as increased regulatory cooperation among privacy authorities globally . The Company has adopted a comprehensive global privacy program to manage these evolving requirements and risks and to facilitate the transfer of personal information across international borders.\n\n## Distribution\n\nThe Company sells its human health pharmaceutical products primarily to drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government agencies and managed health care providers, such as health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers and other institutions. Human health vaccines are sold primarily to physicians, wholesalers, distributors and government entities. The Company's professional representatives communicate the effectiveness, safety and value of the Company's pharmaceutical and vaccine products to health care professionals in private practice, group practices, hospitals and managed care organizations. The Company sells its animal health products to veterinarians, distributors, animal producers, farmers and pet owners.\n\n## Raw Materials\n\nThe Company obtains raw materials essential to its business from numerous suppliers worldwide. M ost of the principal materials the Company uses in its manufacturing operations are available from more than one source. However, the Company obtains certain raw or intermediate materials primarily from only one source. The Company attempts, if possible, to mitigate the potential risk associated with raw materials, components and supplies through inventory and appropriate supplier management.\n\n## Patents, Trademarks and Licenses\n\nPatent protection is considered, in the aggregate, to be of material importance to the Company's marketing of its products in the U.S. and in most major foreign markets. Patents may not only cover a product per se , but also pharmaceutical formulations of a product, processes for making a product, including intermediates useful in those processes, and methods of treatment or other uses of a product. Patent protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the legal life of patents in individual countries. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country , depends upon the ty pe of patent and its scope of coverage.\n\nPatent  portfolios  developed  for  products  introduced  by  the  Company  normally  provide  varying  degrees  of  market  exclusivity .  Key  patents,  which generally cover the product per se , may be subject to a patent term restoration (also known as patent term extension or PTE) of up to five years in the U.S., Japan, and certain other jurisdictions. In Europe, up to five years of extended term may be available in the form of a Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC). PTEs and SPCs are awarded to offset a portion of the patent term lost during the clinical testing and regulatory review process of a product prior to approval. The Food and Drug Administration M odernization A ct includes a Pediatric Exclusivity Provision that may provide an additional six months of market exclusivity (added to the patent term for all Orange Book-listed patents, and to the regulatory data exclusivity term for small molecule and biologic products) in the U.S. for indications of new or currently marketed drugs if certain agreed upon pediatric studies are completed by the applicant. The EU also provides an additional six months of pediatric market exclusivity attached to a product's SPC term for both small molecule and biologic products. Japan attaches the additional term for pediatric studies to market exclusivity and this extension is unrelated to patent term. In some countries, one or more regulatory exclusivities, including data exclusivity , may provide  parallel  market  protection  that  is  complementary  to  patent  protection  and,  in  some  cases,  may  provide  more  effective  or  longer  lasting  marketing exclusivity than a product's patent portfolio. In the U.S., the regulatory data/marketing protection term generally runs five years from first marketing approval of a new chemical entity, extended to seven years for an orphan drug indication, and twelve years from first marketing approval of a biological product.",

(4)\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the patents in the above tables cover the product per se (also known as compound patents). For those drug candidates under review or in development, the key U.S. patents may be subject to a future PTE of up to five years and/or six months of pediatric market exclusivity . In addition, depending on the circumstances surrounding any final regulatory approval of the product, there may be other granted patents or pending patent applications that could have relevance to the product as finally approved.\n\nWhile the expiration of the compound patent generally results in loss of market exclusivity for the covered pharmaceutical product, other patents may provide additional market exclusivity associated with certain aspects of the product that extends beyond the compound patent expiration, including those derived from the initial discovery of the product's active ingredient(s) or from product-related innovation that occurs after this initial discovery . These include later-expiring patents directed to (i) processes and intermediates related to methods of manufacture of the active ingredient(s), (ii) use(s) of the product, and (iii) novel compositions and formulations of the product. The effect of product patent expiration on pharmaceutical product sales may also depend upon many other factors such as the nature of the market and the position of the product in it, the growth of the market, the complexities and economics of the process for manufacture of the active ingredient(s) of the product and the requirements of new drug provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic A ct or similar laws and regulations in other countries. In addition, in the U.S. and certain other countries, a variety of different regulatory exclusivities that impact market exclusivity may be available under relevant law.\n\nFor further information with respect to the Company's patents, see Item 1A .

      "question": "How has Abbott Laboratories' structure of Non-Employee Director Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreements evolved from its earlier programs to the 2017 Incentive Stock Program, based on the specific exhibits disclosed in its 10-K filings?",
      "answer": "Abbott Laboratories' Non-Employee Director Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreements have evolved from standalone forms under earlier programs to standardized, globally inclusive forms integrated into the 2017 Incentive Stock Program. In earlier filings, such as Exhibit 10.12 (filed April 24, 2009), and Exhibit 10.21 (2013 10-K), the agreements were distinct and not explicitly tied to a broader stock program. However, in the 2017 Incentive Stock Program, Exhibit 10.47 (filed April 28, 2017) and Exhibit 10.48 explicitly reference the 2017 Program, indicating a more unified and structured framework. Additionally, Exhibit 10.48 specifically addresses foreign non-employee directors, showing an expansion in geographic scope compared to earlier versions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, identify specific exhibits related to Non-Employee Director Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreements from earlier programs, including Exhibit 10.12 (filed April 24, 2009) and Exhibit 10.21 (2013 10-K).",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, identify the corresponding agreements under the 2017 Incentive Stock Program, specifically Exhibit 10.47 and Exhibit 10.48, both filed April 28, 2017.",
        "Step 3: Compare the structure and scope of these agreements, noting that earlier exhibits were standalone, while the 2017 exhibits are explicitly tied to a comprehensive incentive program and include provisions for foreign directors."

      "answer": "Breyanzi, as a biologic product, benefits from a 12-year period of regulatory data protection (RDP) in the U.S., during which the FDA cannot approve biosimilar versions. This extended exclusivity period provides Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) with a stable market environment to recoup investment and expand the product's therapeutic footprint. According to the company's 10-K filing, BMS is actively exploring new indications for Breyanzi, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). The exclusivity period allows BMS to strategically invest in clinical development and commercial expansion, such as pursuing the first-in-class opportunity for CAR-T in CLL, without immediate competitive threat from biosimilars. This aligns with BMS's broader R&D strategy to expand its pipeline of registrational assets and maintain leadership in hematological malignancies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Breyanzi is listed as a marketed biologic product, and U.S. law provides 12 years of RDP for innovative biologics, during which biosimilars cannot be approved.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - BMS is exploring new indications for Breyanzi, including CLL, FL, and MCL, with the potential for Breyanzi to become the first CAR-T therapy available for CLL if approved.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The 12-year RDP for Breyanzi ensures market exclusivity, enabling BMS to invest in expanding its indications in hematological malignancies without biosimilar competition, supporting long-term growth and offsetting future patent expiries of other products."

This strategic investment in cell therapy innovation and expansion into new treatment areas is directly reflected in the significant revenue growth of Breyanzi.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - 'U.S. revenues doubled in sales [for Breyanzi] primarily due to higher demand.'",

      "answer": "BMY is strategically focused on expanding its pipeline of registrational assets from six to up to twelve by leveraging its leadership in autologous CAR-T cell therapies, including Breyanzi. The company has two approved cell therapies\u2014Breyanzi and Abecma\u2014against two distinct targets, and is exploring new indications for Breyanzi such as the treatment of CLL, FL, and MCL. If approved for CLL, Breyanzi would be the first and only CAR-T therapy available for that patient population, significantly broadening its market potential. This pipeline expansion aligns with BMY\u2019s broader R&D ambition to deliver approximately ten INDs per year and increase success rates from first-in-human trials to approval to approximately 20%, supporting the growth in registrational assets.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize: BMY\u2019s strategic focus on expanding the use of Breyanzi and other CAR-T therapies directly supports its goal of increasing registrational assets from six to up to twelve by adding new indications and therapeutic areas."

      "question": "How does BMY's capital investment in CAR-T manufacturing capacity, including its Devens, Massachusetts facility, support its strategic exploration of new indications for Breyanzi in hematologic malignancies?",
      "answer": "BMY has invested capital in its Devens, Massachusetts commercial facility, which was approved by the FDA for CAR-T manufacturing in June 2023, as part of a broader investment in manufacturing infrastructure for cell therapy products like Breyanzi. This manufacturing capacity expansion enables BMY to address production constraints and maintain flexibility in meeting complex processing standards. Strategically, this investment supports BMY\u2019s exploration of new indications for Breyanzi, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), which could position Breyanzi as the first and only CAR-T therapy available for CLL patients. The manufacturing capabilities thus directly enable BMY to advance its hematology leadership and pipeline diversification.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - BMY invested in its Devens, Massachusetts facility, approved by the FDA for CAR-T manufacturing in June 2023, as part of its flexible manufacturing network to meet complex processing standards and address production constraints.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - BMY is exploring new indications for Breyanzi, including CLL, FL, and MCL, which would expand its leadership in hematologic malignancies and potentially position Breyanzi as the first CAR-T therapy available for CLL patients.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - BMY\u2019s capital investment in CAR-T manufacturing infrastructure, such as the Devens facility, directly enables the company to scale production and support clinical development for new indications of Breyanzi, aligning with its strategic focus on expanding its hematology portfolio."

      "answer": "The acquisition of CorEvitas, LLC in August 2023 provided the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment with regulatory-grade, real-world evidence solutions, which enhanced decision-making and reduced the time and cost of drug development. This strategic addition helped offset some of the negative impacts from declining demand for COVID-19-related products and services in 2024, supporting the segment's broader portfolio and positioning it to better serve pharma and biotech customers in a more muted macroeconomic environment.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, we learn that CorEvitas, LLC was acquired on August 14, 2023, and is described as a U.S.-based provider of regulatory-grade, real-world evidence for approved medical treatments and therapies. The acquisition added complementary solutions to enhance decision-making and reduce the time and cost of drug development.",

        "Step 3: Synthesizing both pieces of evidence, the acquisition of CorEvitas, LLC in 2023 directly supported the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment by expanding its offerings in real-world evidence, which became increasingly important in 2024 as the segment faced declining revenues from the waning demand for pandemic-related services."

          "chunk_text": "\nSince 2020, the Life Sciences Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segments as well as the laboratory products business have supported COVID-19 diagnostic testing. Additionally, our pharma services business has provided our pharma and biotech customers with the services they needed to develop and produce vaccines and therapies globally. Since the company's acquisition of PPD in December 2021, the clinical research business has continued to play a leading role in supporting the clinical trials for COV ID-19 vaccines and therapies. These positive impacts continued at much lower levels in 2024 as customer testing as well as therapy and vaccine demand declined. Sales of products related to COVID-19 testing were $0.10 billion and $0.33 billion in 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nDuring 2024, all of our end markets were negatively impacted by a more muted macroeconomic environment and low economic activity in China. Revenues from pharma and biotech and diagnostics and healthcare customers were also negatively impacted by reduced demand for COVID-19 related products and services. As a result, revenues in these end markets declined slightly in the year. Revenues in the academic and government and industrial and applied markets increased slightly as we saw the benefits of our investments into high-impact innovation. During 2024, all geographies were negatively impacted by the more muted macroeconomic environment. Sales grew slightly in Asia-Pacific, including China. Sales growth in Europe was flat and sales in North America declined slightly due to decreased demand for COVID-19 related products. Contributions to organic revenue during 2024 from the Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics, and Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segments were offset by declines in the Life Sciences Solutions segment.\n\nThe company continues to execute its proven growth strategy which consists of three pillars:\n\n- High-impact innovation,\n- Our trusted partner status with customers, and\n- Our unparalleled commercial engine.\n\nGAAP operating income margin and adjusted operating income margin decreased in 2024 due primarily to unfavorable business mix and strategic investments, partially offset by productivity improvements. The decreases in GAAP operating income margin during 2024 were more than offset by lower levels of amortization expense. We estimate that charges for restructuring and related actions incurred for headcount reductions and facility consolidations, which resulted in charges of approximately $0.3 billion in 2024 and $0.3 billion in 2023, will realize annual cost savings of approx imately $0.2 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively, primarily due to reduced employee and facility expenses.\n\nThe company's references to strategic investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, research and development projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience, as well as incentive compensation and recognition for employees. The company's references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system to address inflation, including reduced costs resulting from implementing continuous improvement methodologies, global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing.\n\n## Notable Recent Acquisitions\n\nOn January 3, 2023, the company acquired, within the Specialty Diagnostics segment, The Binding Site Group, a U.K.-based provider of specialty diagnostic assays and instruments to improve the diagnosis and management of blood cancers and immune system disorders.

A decrease in inventories provided cash of $0.60 billion. A decrease in accounts payable used cash of $0.50 billion, and changes in other assets and liabilities used cash of $0.80 billion primarily due to the timing of payments for compensation and income taxes. Cash payments for income taxes were $1.48 billion during 2023.\n\nThe company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates, if any, for one or more of the matters described under the heading 'Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters' in Note 5 could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Investing Activities\n\nDuring 2024, the acquisition of Olink Holding AB (publ) used cash of $3.13 billion.

          "chunk_text": "\nSince 2020, the Life Sciences Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segments as well as the laboratory products business have supported COVID-19 diagnostic testing. Additionally, our pharma services business has provided our pharma and biotech customers with the services they needed to develop and produce vaccines and therapies globally. Since the company's acquisition of PPD in December 2021, the clinical research business has continued to play a leading role in supporting the clinical trials for COV ID-19 vaccines and therapies. These positive impacts continued at much lower levels in 2024 as customer testing as well as therapy and vaccine demand declined. Sales of products related to COVID-19 testing were $0.10 billion and $0.33 billion in 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nDuring 2024, all of our end markets were negatively impacted by a more muted macroeconomic environment and low economic activity in China. Revenues from pharma and biotech and diagnostics and healthcare customers were also negatively impacted by reduced demand for COVID-19 related products and services. As a result, revenues in these end markets declined slightly in the year. Revenues in the academic and government and industrial and applied markets increased slightly as we saw the benefits of our investments into high-impact innovation. During 2024, all geographies were negatively impacted by the more muted macroeconomic environment. Sales grew slightly in Asia-Pacific, including China. Sales growth in Europe was flat and sales in North America declined slightly due to decreased demand for COVID-19 related products. Contributions to organic revenue during 2024 from the Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics, and Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segments were offset by declines in the Life Sciences Solutions segment.\n\nThe company continues to execute its proven growth strategy which consists of three pillars:\n\n- High-impact innovation,\n- Our trusted partner status with customers, and\n- Our unparalleled commercial engine.\n\nGAAP operating income margin and adjusted operating income margin decreased in 2024 due primarily to unfavorable business mix and strategic investments, partially offset by productivity improvements. The decreases in GAAP operating income margin during 2024 were more than offset by lower levels of amortization expense. We estimate that charges for restructuring and related actions incurred for headcount reductions and facility consolidations, which resulted in charges of approximately $0.3 billion in 2024 and $0.3 billion in 2023, will realize annual cost savings of approx imately $0.2 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively, primarily due to reduced employee and facility expenses.\n\nThe company's references to strategic investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, research and development projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience, as well as incentive compensation and recognition for employees. The company's references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system to address inflation, including reduced costs resulting from implementing continuous improvement methodologies, global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing.\n\n## Notable Recent Acquisitions\n\nOn January 3, 2023, the company acquired, within the Specialty Diagnostics segment, The Binding Site Group, a U.K.-based provider of specialty diagnostic assays and instruments to improve the diagnosis and management of blood cancers and immune system disorders. The acquisition expands the segment's portfolio with the addition of pioneering innovation in diagnostics and monitoring for multiple myeloma.\n\nOn August 14, 2023, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, CorEvitas, LLC, a U.S.-based provider of regulatorygrade, real-world evidence for approved medical treatments and therapies. The acquisition expands the segment's portfolio with the addition of highly complementary real-world evidence solutions to enhance decision-making as well as the time and cost of drug development.\n\nOn July 10, 2024, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Olink Holding AB (publ), a Swedish-based provider of next-generation proteomics solutions. The acquisition enhances the segment's capabilities in the high-growth proteomics market with the addition of highly differentiated solutions.

Lebrikizumab has received approval for atopic dermatitis in the EU and Japan, and is under regulatory review in the U.S. for the same indication, making it one approved or under review indication.

      "answer": "Merck's collaboration strategy in precision molecular targeting is demonstrated through two key partnerships: with AstraZeneca on MK-7339 (Lynparza), an oral PARP inhibitor being evaluated in combination with pembrolizumab for expanded indications in NSCLC and SCLC, and with Eisai on MK-7902 (Lenvima), an oral receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor being assessed with pembrolizumab for esophageal and gastric cancers. These collaborations align with Merck\u2019s strategy to expand its oncology portfolio through targeted therapies in combination with Keytruda, leveraging external innovation while maintaining leadership in immuno-oncology.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, extract that MK-7339 (Lynparza) is in development for NSCLC (June 2019 entry) and SCLC (December 2020 entry) under Phase 3 trials.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, identify that MK-7339 is being developed in collaboration with AstraZeneca and is under evaluation in combination with pembrolizumab for expanded oncology indications.",

      "question": "How much total financial commitment and shared development cost has Merck incurred or anticipated in relation to V940 (mRNA-4157), and how does this tie into Merck's broader immuno-oncology strategy as outlined in its 2023 10-K filing?",
      "answer": "Merck incurred a $250 million payment in 2022 upon exercising its option to jointly develop and commercialize V940 (mRNA-4157) with Moderna. Additionally, Merck is sharing development costs equally with Moderna for this investigational individualized neoantigen therapy, which is being evaluated in combination with Keytruda in multiple Phase 3 clinical trials. This commitment aligns with Merck's immuno-oncology strategy, which includes V940 (mRNA-4157) as a key program being tested in the INTerpath-001 and INTerpath-002 trials for melanoma and NSCLC, respectively. The therapy has received Breakthrough Therapy and PRIME designations, underscoring its strategic importance in Merck's oncology pipeline.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Merck made a $250 million payment in 2022 to Moderna upon exercising its option to jointly develop V940 (mRNA-4157), which was charged to R&D expenses.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - Merck and Moderna are sharing development costs and potential profits equally for V940 (mRNA-4157).",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b - V940 (mRNA-4157) is an investigational individualized neoantigen therapy being evaluated in combination with Keytruda in Phase 3 trials (INTerpath-001 for melanoma and INTerpath-002 for NSCLC).",
        "Step 4: Extract from evidence_source_b - V940 (mRNA-4157) has received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA and PRIME designation from the EMA for use in high-risk melanoma, and is a key part of Merck's immuno-oncology strategic pillar.",
        "Step 5: Synthesize - Merck's $250 million upfront investment and shared cost structure with Moderna reflect a significant financial and strategic commitment to V940 (mRNA-4157), which is positioned as a core component of Merck's immuno-oncology portfolio, specifically targeting melanoma and NSCLC within its broader oncology pipeline."

      "answer": "MK-7902 (Lenvima) is being evaluated in combination with Keytruda for expanded indications in esophageal and gastric cancers, as stated in evidence_source_b. This aligns with Merck's broader oncology strategy focused on immuno-oncology and combination therapies, particularly leveraging Keytruda across multiple tumor types. The evidence also shows that Merck is pursuing multiple combination regimens with Keytruda, including with MK-1308A, MK-4280A, and MK-7684A, as well as partnering with other companies like Eisai for MK-7902 development. This reflects a deliberate strategy to extend Keytruda's reach through molecular targeting combinations to solid tumors in high-need areas like gastrointestinal cancers.",

In the U.S. Pension Plans, Emerging Markets Equities increased by $33 million (from $707 million in 2022 to $740 million in 2023). In the International Pension Plans, Emerging Markets Equities increased by $73 million (from $59 million in 2022 to $66 million in 2023 for International Pension Plans' direct Emerging Markets Equities holdings, and from $111 million in 2022 to $110 million in 2023 for the Investment Funds category which includes Emerging Markets Equities).",

        "Step 6: Sum the increases: $33 million (U.S.) + $7 million (International direct) - $1 million (International through Investment Funds) = $39 million net increase, but since the question asks for total increase (not net change), we sum absolute increases only: $33 million + $7 million = $40 million increase (ignoring the $1 million decrease)."

This development timeline allows Gilead to maximize revenue potential before biosimilar competition emerges.

      "answer": "Biktarvy generated $11,850 million in total revenue in 2023, an increase from $10,390 million in 2022, representing a 14% growth. Given that Biktarvy is a key revenue driver, Gilead may need to prioritize extending its patent protection or developing follow-on therapies to maintain market exclusivity and revenue stability. The 10-K filing highlights that patent expiration dates for principal products, including those in fixed-dose combinations like Biktarvy, are critical for long-term revenue planning. If Biktarvy\u2019s patent expires sooner than anticipated, the growth momentum may not be sustainable due to potential generic competition.",

      "answer": "Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy is being evaluated in breast cancer as a first-line treatment for PD-L1 negative metastatic TNBC and HR+/HER2- chemo-naive metastatic breast cancer. In collaboration with Merck, it is also being tested in combination with pembrolizumab as a first-line treatment for PD-L1 positive metastatic TNBC and as an adjuvant treatment for early TNBC. In genitourinary cancer, it is being evaluated as a second-line treatment for metastatic UC, for which the FDA granted accelerated approval for Trodelvy in April 2021. The collaboration with Merck directly enables the testing of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy in combination with pembrolizumab, thereby expanding its potential indications to include PD-L1 positive metastatic TNBC and early TNBC adjuvant therapy.",
