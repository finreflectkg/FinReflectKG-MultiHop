      "question": "How do the changes in LTIP units and other unit issuances during 2023 affect the total equity of SPG as reported in its 2023 10-K filing?",
      "answer": "The changes in LTIP units and other unit issuances contributed to a net increase in total equity. Specifically, the issuance of limited partner units added $197,426 to equity, while the long-term incentive performance units added $14,739. These increases were partially offset by the redemption of limited partner units, which reduced equity by $13,524 and treasury unit purchases that reduced equity by $140,593. Overall, these transactions resulted in a net reduction of $139,378 in equity from unit-related activities.",

      "answer": "LTIP units are treated as participating securities under the two-class method of computing earnings per share because they entitle participants to receive distributions equal to 10% of the regular quarterly distributions paid on a unit of the Operating Partnership. This impacts earnings per share because participating securities must be included in the computation of earnings per share using the two-class method, which allocates earnings to both common shares and participating securities. Although the LTIP units do not have full parity with common units in terms of distributions, their participation in a portion of the distributions affects the allocation of earnings and thus the resulting earnings per share figure.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - LTIP units are granted under the 2019 Plan and participants receive distributions equal to 10% of the regular quarterly distributions paid on a unit of the Operating Partnership.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - LTIP units are considered potentially dilutive securities, and distributions are accrued when declared.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Because LTIP unit holders receive a portion of the distributions, they are classified as participating securities, which requires the use of the two-class method in earnings per share calculations, thereby directly influencing reported EPS."

      "question": "How does the increased use of e-commerce by retail tenants, as mentioned in the risk factors, contribute to the difficulty Simon Property Group (SPG) faces in leasing spaces and maintaining rental rates at its properties?",
      "answer": "The increased use of e-commerce by retail tenants has led to lower demand for physical retail space, which directly contributes to higher vacancy rates at SPG's properties. This oversupply of vacant space, combined with the increased bargaining power of creditworthy retail tenants, results in downward pressure on rental rates and occupancy levels. Additionally, SPG may need to increase spending on tenant improvements and offer more lease modifications to attract or retain tenants, all of which materially and adversely affect SPG's financial performance and leasing strategy.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - 'Vacant space at our properties could materially and adversely affect us' is listed as a key risk factor.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - 'There has been lower demand from retail tenants for space, due to certain retailers increasing their use of e-commerce websites to distribute their merchandise.'",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The increased use of e-commerce directly correlates with reduced demand for physical retail space, leading to higher vacancy rates at SPG properties.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize further - Higher vacancy rates and lower tenant demand lead to increased tenant bargaining power, which causes downward pressure on rental rates and forces SPG to spend more on tenant improvements and lease modifications.",
        "Step 5: Conclude - These combined effects create material adverse impacts on SPG\u2019s leasing strategy and financial performance."

      "answer": "The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 introduced partnership tax audit rules that assess taxes, interest, or penalties at the partnership level for audit adjustments to income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit items. Simon Property Group (SPG), through its investments in 84 joint venture properties and entities like Kl\u00e9pierre and The Taubman Realty Group, LLC, could be required to bear the economic burden of these taxes, interest, and penalties even though SPG and its subsidiary REITs may not otherwise have been subject to additional corporate-level taxes had they owned the assets directly. This financial exposure arises because SPG applies the equity method of accounting to these joint ventures, and as a direct or indirect partner, SPG may be liable for partnership-level assessments without the ability to opt out of the rules, potentially resulting in material adverse effects on SPG's financial position.",

Under the rules, among other changes and subject to certain exceptions, any audit adjustment to items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit of a partnership (and any partner's distributive share thereof) is determined, and taxes, interest, or penalties attributable thereto could be assessed and collected, at the partnership level. Absent available elections, it is possible that a partnership in which we directly or indirectly invest, could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties as a result of an audit adjustment, and we, as a direct or indirect partner of these  partnerships,  could  be  required  to  bear  the  economic  burden  of  those  taxes,  interest,  and  penalties  even though  Simon  and  the  Subsidiary  REITs,  as  REITs,  may  not  otherwise  have  been  required  to  pay  additional corporate-level taxes had they owned the assets of the partnership directly. The partnership tax audit rules apply to the  Operating  Partnership  and  its  subsidiaries  that  are  classified  as  partnerships  for  U.S.  federal  income  tax purposes.

New legislation (including the TCJA, and any technical corrections legislation), Treasury  regulations,  administrative  interpretations  or  court  decisions  could  significantly  and  negatively  affect  the ability of Simon and certain subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership to qualify to be taxed as REITs and/or the U.S. federal income tax consequences to us and our investors of such qualification.\n\nThe TCJA has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. businesses and their owners, including REITs and their stockholders. A change made by the TCJA that could affect us and our stockholders is that it generally limits the deduction for net business interest expense in excess of 30% of a business's adjusted taxable income except for taxpayers that engage in certain real estate businesses and elect out of this rule (provided that such electing taxpayers must use an alternative depreciation system for certain property).\n\n## Risks Relating to Joint Ventures\n\n## We have limited control with respect to some properties that are partially owned or managed by third parties, which may adversely affect our ability to sell or refinance them.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we owned interests in 101 income-producing properties with other parties. Of those, 17 properties are included in our consolidated financial statements. We apply the equity method of accounting to the other 84 properties (the joint venture properties) and our investments in Kl\u00e9pierre (a publicly traded, Paris-based real estate company) and The Taubman Realty Group, LLC, or TRG, as well as our investments in certain entities involved in  retail  operations,  such  as  J.C.

Of the joint venture properties for which we do not serve as general partner or property manager, 23 are in our international joint ventures. These international  properties  are  managed locally by joint ventures in which we share control of the properties with our partner.

In  addition,  these  agreements  contain  other  covenants requiring compliance with financial ratios. Furthermore, the amount of debt that we may incur is limited as a practical matter by our desire to maintain acceptable ratings for the debt securities of the Operating Partnership. We strive to maintain investment grade ratings at all  times  for  various  business  reasons,  including  their  effect  on  our  ability  to access attractive capital, but we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so in the future.\n\nIf  Simon's  Board  of  Directors  determines  to  seek  additional  capital,  we  may  raise  such  capital  by  offering equity  or  incurring  debt,  creating  joint  ventures  with  existing  ownership  interests  in  properties,  entering  into  joint venture  arrangements  for  new  development  projects,  retaining  cash  flows  or  a  combination  of  these  methods.  If Simon's Board of Directors determines to raise equity capital, it may, without stockholder approval, issue additional shares of common stock or other capital stock. Simon's Board of Directors may issue a number of shares up to the amount of our authorized capital or may issue units in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration as it deems  appropriate.  We  may  also  raise  additional  capital  by  issuing  common  units  of  partnership  interest  in  the Operating Partnership, or units.  Such securities  also  may  include  additional  classes  of  Simon's  preferred  stock  or preferred units of partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, or preferred units, which may be convertible into common  stock  or  units,  as  the  case  may  be.  Existing  stockholders  and  unitholders  have  no  preemptive  right  to purchase  shares  or  units  in  any  subsequent  issuances  of  securities  by  us. Any  issuance  of  equity  could  dilute  a stockholder's investment in Simon or a limited partner's investment in the Operating Partnership.\n\nWe expect most future  borrowings  will  be  made  through  the  Operating  Partnership  or  its  subsidiaries.  We might,  however,  incur  borrowings  through  other  entities  that  would  be  reloaned  to  the  Operating  Partnership. Borrowings  may  be  in  the  form  of  bank  borrowings,  publicly  and  privately  placed  debt  instruments,  or  purchase money  obligations  to  the  sellers  of  properties.  Any  such  indebtedness  may  be  secured  or  unsecured.  Any  such indebtedness may also have full or limited recourse to the borrower or be cross-collateralized with other debt, or may be  fully  or  partially  guaranteed  by  the  Operating  Partnership.  We  issue  unsecured  debt  securities  through  the Operating Partnership, but we may issue other debt securities which may be convertible into common or preferred stock or be accompanied by warrants to purchase common or preferred stock. We also may sell or securitize our lease receivables. Although we may borrow to fund the payment of dividends, we currently have no expectation that we will regularly do so.\n\nThe Operating Partnership has a $4.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, or the Credit Facility and a $3.5 billion supplemental unsecured revolving credit facility, or Supplemental Facility, or together, the Credit Facilities.

The initial maturity date of the Credit Facility is June 30, 2024. The Credit Facility can be extended for two additional six-month periods to June 30, 2025, at our sole option, subject to satisfying certain customary conditions precedent.\n\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at our election, at either (i) (x) for Term Benchmark Loans, the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, the applicable Local Rate, the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate, or the Adjusted TIBOR Rate, (y) for RFR Loans, if denominated in Sterling, SONIA plus a benchmark adjustment and if denominated in Dollars, Daily Simple SOFR plus a benchmark adjustment, or (z) for Daily SOFR Loans, the Adjusted Floating Overnight Daily SOFR Rate, in each case of clauses (x) through (z) above, plus a margin determined by our corporate credit rating of between 0.650% and 1.400% or (ii) for loans denominated in U.S. Dollars only, the base rate (which rate is equal to the  greatest  of  the  prime  rate,  the  federal  funds  effective  rate  plus  0.500%  or Adjusted  Term  SOFR  Rate  for  one month plus 1.000%) (the 'Base Rate'), plus a margin determined by our corporate credit rating of between 0.000% and 0.400%.

These swaps were designated as fair value hedges, had an aggregate notional amount of $600.0 million, had an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and expired in January 2022. The 2.250% Notes were subsequently repaid in full on January 14, 2022. In addition, we have three interest rate swap agreements related to a portion of our 3.000% senior unsecured notes due 2023 (the '3.000% Notes'). These swaps have been designated as fair value hedges, have an aggregate notional amount of $500.0 million, have an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and expire in June 2023.\n\nChanges in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt. Variable rate debt as of December 31, 2021 consisted of $4.4 billion under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, $1.4 billion under the 2021 Credit Facility, $1.0 billion under the 2021 Term Loan, $938.2 million under the 2021 EUR Three Year Delayed Draw Term Loan, $3.0 billion under the 2021 USD 364-Day Delayed Draw Term Loan, $1.5 billion under the 2021 USD Two Year Delayed Draw Term Loan, $600.0 million under the interest rate swap agreements related to the 2.250% Notes and $500.0 million under the interest rate swap agreements related to the 3.000% Notes. A 10% increase in current interest rates would result in an additional $16.3 million of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\n## Foreign Currency Risk\n\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in connection with our foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures internationally. Any transaction denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar is reported in U.S. Dollars at the applicable exchange rate. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period. The cumulative translation effect is included in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We may enter into additional foreign currency financial instruments in anticipation of future transactions to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. For the year ended December 31, 2021, 44% of our revenues and 52% of our total operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies.",

The Company provides for accelerated vesting and extended exercise periods of stock options and restricted stock units upon an employee's death or permanent disability, or upon an employee's qualified retirement, provided certain eligibility criteria are met. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation expense for stock options and time-based restricted stock units ('RSUs') over the shorter of (i) the vesting period or (ii) the period from the date of grant to the date the employee becomes eligible for such benefits due to death, disability or qualified retirement, which may occur upon grant. The expense recognized includes the impact of forfeitures as they occur. Equity awards typically vest ratably. Awards of RSUs and stock options granted prior to March 10, 2023 generally vest over four years. In December 2022, the Company's Compensation Committee changed the terms of its awards to generally vest over three years. The change in vesting terms is applicable for new awards granted beginning on March 10, 2023 and does not change the vesting terms applicable to grants awarded prior to March 10, 2023.\n\nThe Company grants performance-based restricted stock units ('PSUs') to its executive officers. Threshold, target and maximum parameters are established for a three-year performance period at the time of grant. The metrics are used to calculate the number of shares that will be issuable when the awards vest, which may range from zero to 200% of the target amounts. The Company recognizes compensation expense for PSUs over the three-year vesting period, subject to adjustment based on the date the employee becomes eligible for retirement benefits as well as performance relative to grant parameters. The Company's PSUs granted in 2024 also include a market condition component.\n\nThe fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the fair value of RSUs and PSUs is based on the fair value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. For the component of the PSUs subject to a market condition, fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which uses multiple input variables to determine the probability of satisfying the market condition requirements. The Company recognizes all stock-based compensation expense in Selling, general, administrative and development expense.\n\nIn connection with the vesting of restricted stock units, the Company withholds from issuance a number of shares of common stock to satisfy certain employee tax withholding obligations arising from such vesting. The shares withheld are considered constructively retired. The Company recognizes the fair value of the shares withheld in Additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has withheld from issuance an aggregate of 3.3 million shares, including 0.3 million shares related to the vesting of restricted stock units during the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\nLitigation Costs -The Company periodically becomes involved in various claims and lawsuits that are incidental to its business. The Company regularly monitors the status of pending legal actions to evaluate both the magnitude and likelihood of any potential loss. The Company accrues for these potential losses when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss, or possible range of loss, can be reasonably estimated. Should the ultimate losses on contingencies or litigation vary from estimates, adjustments to those liabilities may be required. The Company also incurs legal costs in connection with these matters and records estimates of these expenses, which are reflected in Selling, general, administrative and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\n\nEarnings Per Common Share -Basic and Diluted -Basic net income per common share represents net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share represents net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and any dilutive common share equivalents, including (A) shares issuable upon the vesting of RSUs and exercise of stock options and (B) shares expected to be earned upon the achievement of the parameters established for PSUs, each to the extent not anti-dilutive. The Company uses the treasury stock method to calculate the effect of its outstanding RSUs, PSUs and stock options.\n\nRetirement Plan -The Company has a 401(k) plan covering nearly all eligible employees who meet certain age and employment requirements. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company matched 100% of the first 5% of a participant's contributions. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company contributed $15.0 million, $15.6 million and $15.8 million to the plan, respectively.\n\nStonepeak Development PartnershipDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with Stonepeak (as defined in note 15) to form a joint venture to construct a new data center in Denver, CO (the 'Stonepeak Development Partnership'). At formation, the Company contributed assets with a value of $14.6 million to the Stonepeak Development Partnership and acquired a minority ownership interest (Stonepeak holds the controlling interests). The Company accounts for the Stonepeak Development Partnership as an equity method investment. Under this method, investments are",

Vesting of RSUs is subject generally to the employee's continued employment or death, disability or qualified retirement (each as defined in the applicable RSU award agreement).\n\nPerformance-Based Restricted Stock UnitsDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company's Compensation Committee (the 'Compensation Committee') granted an aggregate of 87,550 PSUs (the '2024 PSUs') to its executive officers and established the performance and market metrics for these awards. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company's Compensation Committee granted an aggregate of 118,684 PSUs (the '2023 PSUs') and 98,542 PSUs (the '2022 PSUs'), respectively, to its ex ecutive officers and established the performance metrics for these awards.\n\nThreshold, target and maximum parameters were established for the metrics for a three-year performance period with respect to each of the 2024 PSUs, the 2023 PSUs and the 2022 PSUs and will be used to calculate the number of shares that will be issuable when each award vests, which may range from zero to 200% of the target amounts. At the end of each three-year performance period, the number of shares that vest will depend on the degree of achievement against the pre-established goals. PSUs will be paid out in common stock at the end of each performance period, subject generally to the executive's continued employment or death, disability or qualified retirement (each as defined in the applicable PSU award agreement). PSUs will accrue dividend equivalents prior to vesting, which will be paid out only in respect of shares that actually vest.\n\nThe 2024 PSUs include a market condition component based on relative total shareholder return as measured against the REIT constituents included in the S&amp;P 500 Index.

      "question": "How did AMT use its 2021 credit facilities to refinance senior notes before the 2024 Notes offering, and what was the total principal amount repaid using the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility?",
      "answer": "AMT used the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility to repay three tranches of senior notes maturing in 2024: $500.0 million of 0.600% Notes on January 12, 2024; $1.0 billion of 5.00% Notes on February 14, 2024; and $650.0 million of 3.375% Notes on May 15, 2024. This totals $2.15 billion in principal repayments made using the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility and the 2021 Credit Facility. Subsequently, the net proceeds of approximately $1,183.7 million from the 2024 Notes offering were used to repay the indebtedness under the same credit facilities, effectively refinancing a portion of the earlier borrowings.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - AMT repaid $500.0 million of 0.600% Notes, $1.0 billion of 5.00% Notes, and $650.0 million of 3.375% Notes using borrowings from the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility and 2021 Credit Facility.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The net proceeds of $1,183.7 million from the 2024 Notes offering were used to repay existing indebtedness under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility and the 2021 Credit Facility.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The $2.15 billion in senior note repayments using the credit facilities was partially refinanced through the 2024 Notes offering, which contributed $1.1837 billion back into repaying the credit facilities."
