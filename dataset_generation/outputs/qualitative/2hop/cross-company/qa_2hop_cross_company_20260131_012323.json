          "chunk_text": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Recent Business Environment\n\nDuring 2024, the price of crude oil remained near the middle of the pre-COVID 10-year range (2010-2019), as markets remained balanced. Through the first nine months of the year, natural gas prices declined towards the middle of the 10-year range due to strong supply and lower demand. In the fourth quarter, natural gas prices increased on rising demand driven by colder weather in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nRefining margins declined in 2024 from high 2023 levels as increased supply from industry capacity additions outpaced record global demand and remain near the bottom of the 10-year range. Chemical margins improved slightly in 2024 but remained well below the 10-year range driven by over-supply, primarily in Asia.\n\nThe general rate of inflation across major countries peaked in 2022, rising from already elevated levels in 2021, due to additional impacts on energy and other commodities from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Inflation has trended down since 2023 as a result of aggressive monetary tightening by major central banks and slowing  global  economic  growth.  However,  there  has  been  significant  variation  on  the  pace  of  change  across  OECD  and  non-OECD  countries.  With  inflation gradually approaching the official targets in the  U.S. and  Eurozone, the  Federal  Reserve and the  European  Central  Bank began lowering interest rates in 2024. Meanwhile, China has been under persistent deflationary pressure since 2023.\n\nThe Corporation closely monitors market trends and works to mitigate both operating and capital cost impacts in all price environments. Organizational changes implemented over the past several years enabled the Corporation to capture $12.1 billion of structural cost savings versus 2019, including $2.4 billion of savings during 2024, through increased operational efficiencies, workforce reductions, divestment-related reductions, and other cost-saving measures. The Company sees additional opportunities in areas such as supply chain efficiency, improved maintenance and turnarounds, modernized data management, centralization of activities, and simplified business processes. These savings are key drivers to further reduce our structural costs by $6 billion by 2030, thereby improving the earnings power of the Corporation. ( 1 )\n\nRefer to Frequently Used Terms for definition of structural cost savings. (1)\n\n## Transportation of Kazakhstan Production\n\nThe Corporation holds a 25 percent interest in Tengizchevroil, LLP (TCO), which operates the Tengiz and Korolev oil fields in Kazakhstan, and a 16.8 percent working interest in the Kashagan field in Kazakhstan. Oil production from those operations is exported primarily through the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), in which the Corporation holds a 7.5 percent interest. CPC traverses parts of Kazakhstan and Russia to tanker-loading facilities on the Russian coast of the Black Sea. In the event geopolitical issues escalate in the region, including ongoing military conflict, it is possible that the transportation of Kazakhstan oil through the CPC pipeline could be disrupted, curtailed, temporarily suspended, or otherwise restricted. In such a case, the Corporation could experience a loss of cash flows of uncertain duration from its operations in Kazakhstan. For reference, after-tax  earnings related to the Corporation's interests in Kazakhstan in 2024 were approx imately $1.9 billion, and its share of combined oil and gas production was approximately 260 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day.",

At December 31, 2024, the company's carrying value of its investment in TCO was about $73 higher than the amount of underlying equity in TCO's net assets. This difference results from  Chevron acquiring a portion of its interest in TCO at a value greater than the underlying book value for that portion of TCO's net assets. Included in the investment is a loan to TCO to fund the development of the Wellhead Pressure Management Project (WPMP) and Future Growth Project (FGP) with a principal balance of $4,500.\n\nCaspian Pipeline Consortium Chevron has a 15 percent interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which provides the critical export route for crude oil from both TCO and Karachaganak.\n\nAngola LNG Limited Chevron has a 36.4 percent interest in Angola LNG  Limited, which processes and liquefies natural gas produced in Angola for delivery to international markets.\n\nChevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC Chevron owns 50 percent of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC.

For example, many of the early licenses issued under the first four licensing rounds provided an initial term of six  years with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of the initial term, subject to ex tension for a further 40 years. At the end of any such 40-year term, licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on a case-by-case basis until they become producing areas; or licenses terminate in all other areas. The majority of traditional licenses currently  issued  have  an  initial  ex ploration  term  of  four  years  with  a  second  term  ex tension  of  four  years,  and  a  final  production  term  of  18  years,  with  a mandatory relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term.\n\n## Africa\n\n## Angola\n\nExploration and production activities are governed by either production sharing agreements or other concession contracts with initial exploration terms ranging from three to four years with options to extend from one to five years. The production periods range from 20 to 30 years, with extensions subject to negotiation with the National Concessionaire.\n\n## Mozambique\n\nExploration and production activities are generally governed by concession contracts with the G overnment of the Republic of Mozambique, represented by the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy. An interest in Area 4 offshore Mozambique was acquired in 2017. Terms for Area 4 are governed by the Exploration and Production Concession Contract (EPCC) for Area 4 Offshore of the Rovuma Block. The EPCC expires 30 years after an approved plan of development becomes effective for a given discovery area.\n\n## Nigeria\n\nExploration and production activities are governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) with the national oil company, the  Nigerian  National  Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCL). NNPCL typically holds the underlying license or lease.  The terms of the  PSCs are generally 30 years (comprised of a 10-year exploration period and a 20-year production period).\n\nThe 2021 Petroleum Industry Act will govern any further renewals to the term of the PSCs, licenses, or leases.\n\n## Asia\n\n## Azerbaijan\n\nThe production sharing agreement (PSA) for the development of the Azeri-Chirag-G unashli field was established for an initial period of 30 years starting from the PSA execution date in 1994. The PSA was amended in September 2017 to extend the term by 25 years to 2049.\n\n## Indonesia\n\nExploration and production activities in Indonesia are generally governed by cooperation contracts, usually in the form of a production sharing contract (PSC). The current PSCs have an exploration period of six years, which can be extended once for a period of four years with a total contract period of 30 years including an exploitation period. PSC terms can be extended for a maximum of 20 years for each extension with the approval of the government.\n\n## Kazakhstan\n\nOnshore exploration  and  production  activities  are  governed  by  the  production  license,  which  includes  ex ploration  activities  and  joint  venture  agreements negotiated with the Republic of Kazakhstan. Existing production operations have a 40-year production period that commenced in 1993.\n\nOffshore exploration and production activities are governed by a production sharing agreement negotiated with the Republic of Kazakhstan. The exploration period is six  years followed by separate appraisal periods for each discovery. The production period for each discovery, which includes development, is 20 years from the date of declaration of commerciality with the possibility of two 10-year ex tensions.\n\n## Malaysia\n\nProduction activities are governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) negotiated with the national oil company. The PSCs have production terms of 25 years. Extensions are generally subject to the national oil company's prior written approval.",

        "Step 1: From the ExxonMobil 2024 10-K filing, in the Angola section, it is explicitly stated that 'During the year, a total of 5.6 net exploratory and development wells were completed.'",

        "Step 3: To calculate the total number of net wells completed in Angola by both companies, the explicitly stated number from ExxonMobil (5.6) is used, and Chevron's lack of reporting on well completions in Angola implies no contribution from Chevron to the total."

Throughout the document, certain totals and percentages may not sum to their component parts due to rounding.\n\n## Business Environment and Outlook\n\nChevron Corporation is a global energy company with direct and indirect subsidiaries and affiliates that conduct substantial business activities in the following countries: Angola, Argentina, Australia,  Bangladesh,  Brazil,  Canada,  China,  Egypt,  Equatorial  G uinea,  Israel,  Kazakhstan,  Mex ico,  Nigeria,  the  Partitioned  Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States and Venezuela.\n\nThe company's objective is to safely deliver higher returns, lower carbon and superior shareholder value in any business environment. Earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment. The most significant factor affecting the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil, which is determined in global markets outside of the company's control. In the company's downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. Periods of sustained lower commodity prices could result in the impairment or write-off of specific assets in future periods and cause the  company  to  adjust  operating  ex penses,  including  employee  reductions,  and  capital  ex penditures,  along  with  other  measures  intended  to  improve  financial performance.\n\nSome governments, companies, communities and other stakeholders are supporting efforts to address climate change. International initiatives and national, regional and state legislation and regulations that aim to directly or indirectly reduce GHG  emissions are in various stages of design, adoption and implementation. These policies and programs, some of which support the global net zero emissions ambitions of the Paris Agreement, can change the amount of energy consumed, the rate of energy-demand growth, the energy mix and the relative economics of one fuel versus another. Implementation of jurisdiction-specific policies and programs can be dependent on, and can affect the pace of, technological advancements; the granting of necessary permits by governing authorities; the availability and acceptability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon credits; the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability-related standards; evolving regulatory or other requirements affecting ESG  standards or disclosures and evolving standards and regulations for tracking, reporting, marketing and advertising relating to emissions and emission reductions and removals.\n\nSome of these policies and programs include renewable and low carbon fuel standards, such as the Renewable Fuel Standard program in the U.S. and California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard; programs that price GHG emissions, including",

      "answer": "Chevron produced 55 thousand barrels per day (MBD) of crude oil in Angola in 2023, while ExxonMobil operates under production sharing agreements with exploration terms ranging from 3 to 4 years, with options to extend. Chevron's higher production volume indicates a more established operational presence in Angola compared to ExxonMobil, which is still navigating exploration phases with potential for future development.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Chevron's crude oil production in Angola was 55 MBD in 2023.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - ExxonMobil's operations in Angola are governed by production sharing agreements with initial exploration terms ranging from 3 to 4 years, with options to extend.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The difference in crude oil production between Chevron and ExxonMobil in Angola reflects their respective operational scales and exploration phases, with Chevron having a more mature production setup and ExxonMobil still in earlier exploration stages with potential for future development."

      "question": "How did Chevron and ExxonMobil's combined oil-equivalent production volumes change from 2022 to 2023, and what might this indicate about their production strategies in the current energy market?",
      "answer": "Chevron's total oil-equivalent production decreased from 11,229 million barrels in 2022 to 11,069 million barrels in 2023, a decline of 160 million barrels. ExxonMobil's oil-equivalent production remained flat at 3,738 thousand barrels daily in 2023 compared to 3,737 thousand barrels daily in 2022. The combined production decline of 160 million barrels from Chevron suggests a potential strategic reduction or plateau in production volumes, while ExxonMobil's stable output indicates a maintenance of existing production levels. This could reflect differing approaches to navigating the current energy market conditions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From Chevron's 10-K filing, the total oil-equivalent production for 2022 is 11,229 million barrels and for 2023 is 11,069 million barrels, showing a decrease of 160 million barrels.",
        "Step 2: From ExxonMobil's 10-K filing, the oil-equivalent production for 2022 is 3,737 thousand barrels daily and for 2023 is 3,738 thousand barrels daily, showing an increase of 1 thousand barrels daily.",
        "Step 3: Combining the data, Chevron's production decline contrasts with ExxonMobil's stable output, indicating potentially different production strategies in response to the energy market dynamics."

      "answer": "Chevron (CVX) reported a 29 million barrel decrease in proved reserves in the Delaware and Midland basins in 2023 due to reservoir performance, signaling a material impact on reserve estimates in unconventional resources. ExxonMobil (XOM), which also operates in unconventional basins like the Permian, explicitly includes 'reservoir performance, including variability and timing factors applicable to unconventional resources' as a risk factor affecting its forward-looking statements, particularly for projects tied to achieving net-zero emissions targets in the Permian Basin by 2030. This shows that reservoir performance issues, such as those observed by CVX, could directly affect XOM's ability to meet production and emissions goals in similar unconventional plays.",

In contrast, XOM emphasizes rigorous technical oversight through its dedicated Global Reserves and Resources group, which utilizes integrated geological, engineering, and production data\u2014including well logs, reservoir core samples, and 3-D/4-D seismic data\u2014to estimate proved reserves with reasonable certainty. XOM\u2019s process includes mandatory review and endorsement by its oversight group before any changes to reserves estimates are made in the central database. This highlights that while CVX explicitly ties reservoir performance to uncertainty in reserves and production forecasts, XOM institutionalizes technical oversight and data integration to manage the impact of reservoir performance on reserves estimation.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - CVX reported proved reserves of 11.1 billion barrels of oil-equivalent at year-end 2023, with a reserve replacement ratio of 86% in 2023, and explicitly links reservoir performance to uncertainty in production estimates.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - XOM utilizes integrated data (well logs, core samples, seismic data) and maintains a dedicated Global Reserves and Resources group to oversee reserves estimation, requiring rigorous review before any changes to reserves estimates are approved.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While CVX highlights reservoir performance as a source of uncertainty in reserves and production outlook, XOM institutionalizes technical oversight and data integration to manage reservoir performance impacts, showing differing approaches to handling the same risk factor."

Prudhoe Bay, the largest conventional oil field in North America, is the site of a large waterflood and enhanced oil recovery operation, supported by a large gas and water processing operation. Field installations include seven production facilities, two gas plants, two seawater plants and a central power station. In 2024, on average, there were two rigs drilling throughout the year.\n\n## Greater Kuparuk Area\n\nThe Greater Kuparuk Area includes the Kuparuk River Unit, which consists of the Kuparuk Field and six satellite fields. Field installations include three central production facilities which separate oil, natural gas and water, and a seawater treatment plant. In 2024, we operated two drilling rigs and two workover rigs. The Nuna project, which targets the Moraine reservoir, was sanctioned in 2023 and achieved first oil in the fourth quarter of 2024. The Coyote reservoir discovered in 2021 progressed to development in 2023 with additional wells drilled in 2024 and planned for 2025.",

Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources, including natural gas. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to:\n\n- Whether and to what extent legislation or regulation is enacted;\n- The timing of the introduction of such legislation or regulation;\n- The nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions) or regulation;\n- The price placed on GHG emissions (either by the market or through a tax);\n- The GHG emissions reductions required;\n- The price and availability of offsets;\n- The amount and allocation of allowances;\n- Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services;\n- Any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature); and\n- Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services.\n\nSee Item 1A.

The strategy sets out our choices around portfolio composition, emissions reductions, targets and incentives, emissions-related technology development, and our climate-related policy and finance sector engagement.\n\nOur Climate Risk Strategy is intended to enable us to responsibly meet the global demand for energy, deliver competitive returns on and of capital and work to meet our previously established emissions-reduction targets. First, meeting global energy demand requires a focus on delivering production that will best compete in any energy mix scenario. This production will be delivered from resources with a competitive cost of supply and low GHG intensity, as well as portfolio diversity by market and asset type. Next, in delivering competitive returns, ConocoPhillips has been a leader in shifting the exploration and production sector's value proposition away from one focused on production toward one focused on returns. Finally, to drive accountability for the emissions that are within our control, we are progressing toward our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity targets.\n\n59\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K",

In particular, GHG  emissions-related legislation, regulations, and other government actions, and shifting customer and consumer preferences and other private efforts aimed at reducing GHG  emissions may result in increased and substantial capital, compliance, operating, and maintenance costs and could, among other things, reduce demand for hydrocarbons and the company's hydrocarbonbased products; increase demand for lower carbon products and alternative energy sources; make the company's products more expensive; adversely affect the economic feasibility of the company's resources; impact or limit our business plans; and adversely affect the company's sales volumes, revenues, margins and reputation. For example, some jurisdictions are in various stages of design, adoption, and implementation of policies and programs that cap emissions and/or require short-, medium-, and long-term GHG reductions by operators at the asset or facility level, which may not be technologically feasible, or which could require significant capital ex penditure, increase costs of or limit production, result in impairment of assets and limit Chevron's ability to cost-effectively reduce G HG  emissions across its global portfolio. Additionally, some jurisdictions are in various stages of enacting or implementing legislation that imposes retroactive liability on estimated past GHG emissions by certain energy producers and refiners.\n\nThe ultimate effect of international agreements; national, regional, and state legislation and regulation; and government and private actions related to GHG  emissions and climate change on the company's financial performance, and the timing of these effects, will depend on a number of factors. Such factors include, among others, the sectors covered, the GHG emissions reductions required, the use of standardized carbon accounting, the extent to which Chevron would be able to receive, generate, purchase, or retire credits, the price and availability of credits and the ex tent to which the company is able to recover, or continue to recover, the costs incurred through the pricing of the company's products in the competitive marketplace. Further, the ultimate impact of GHG  emissions and climate change-related agreements, legislation, regulation, and government actions on the company's financial performance is highly uncertain because the company is unable to predict with certainty, for a multitude of individual jurisdictions, the outcome of political decision-making processes and legal challenges, including the actual laws and regulations  enacted,  the  variables  and  trade-offs  that  inevitably  occur  in  connection  with  such  processes,  and  market  conditions,  including  the  responses  of consumers to such changes.\n\nAttention to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters impacts our company Attention to ESG matters, including those related to climate change and sustainability, evolving societal, investor and governmental pressure on companies to address ESG  matters, and potential customer and consumer use of substitutes to  Chevron's products have resulted and may continue to result in changes to the portfolio and company activities, increased costs, reduced demand for our products, reduced profits, increased investigations and litigation or threats thereof, negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets, impaired participation in public discourse and debate by the company relating to mandatory and voluntary standards and regulations, and damage to our reputation. For example, increasing attention to ESG  matters, including climate change, has resulted and may result in the future in shifting demand for our hydrocarbon products, and have resulted in additional litigation and governmental investigations, or threats thereof, against the company. For instance, we have received investigative requests and demands from the U.S. Congress for information relating to climate change, methane leak detection and repair, and other topics, and further requests and/or  demands  are  possible. At  this  time,  Chevron  cannot  predict  the  ultimate  impact  any  Congressional  or  other  investigations  may  have  on  the  company. Information related to climate-change related litigation matters is included in Note 16 Litigation under the heading 'Climate Change.'\n\nSome stakeholders, including but not limited to sovereign wealth, pension, and endowment funds, have been divesting and promoting divestment of or screening out of fossil fuel equities and urging lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. Further, voluntary carbon-related and targetsetting frameworks have been developed that may limit the ability of certain sectors, including the oil and gas sector, from accessing capital, and may result in exclusion of the company's equity or debt from being included as an investment option in portfolios. In addition, some stakeholders, including some of our investors, have divergent and evolving views on our ESG-related strategies and priorities, vis-\u00e0-vis our lines of business, calling for focus on increased production of oil and gas products rather than lower carbon business lines and climate-related targets.  These circumstances, among others, may result in pressure from activists on production;  unfavorable  reputational  impacts,  including  inaccurate  perceptions  or  a  misrepresentation  of  our  actual  ESG   policies,  practices  and  performance; diversion of management's attention and resources; and proxy fights, among other material adverse impacts on our businesses.",

This reflects a scenario where the presence of hydrocarbons is known, but reserve recognition is delayed due to complex project economics and development planning. ConocoPhillips explicitly identifies 'potential failures or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas developments' as a material risk factor in its 2022 10-K. Chevron's disclosure illustrates a real-world example of this risk, where long-standing exploratory wells remain unevaluated for reserve classification under SEC rules, demonstrating how even established hydrocarbon discoveries may not translate into proved reserves in a timely manner.

To the extent  these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods could be materially adversely affected.\n\nExisting and future laws, regulations and internal initiatives relating to global climate change, such as limitations on GHG emissions may impact or limit our business plans, result in significant expenditures, promote alternative uses of energy or reduce demand for our products.\n\nContinuing political and social attention to the issue of global climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit GHG emissions, such as cap and trade regimes, specific emission standards, carbon taxes, restrictive permitting, increased fuel efficiency standards and incentives or mandates for renewable energy.  Although we may support many of these legislative and regulatory measures, how and when they are enacted could result in a material adverse effect to our business, financial condition, results of operations  and cash flows in future periods.\n\nFor example, in November 2021, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency published a Proposed Rule that would revise the regulations governing the emission of GHG and volatile organic compounds from new oil and gas production facilities, and emission guidelines for states to use when revising Clean Air Act implementation plans to limit GHG emissions from existing oil and gas facilities.  Although the company supports the direct federal regulation of methane from new and existing sources, the final form and substance of any regulations are not currently known and could result in additional capital expenditures and compliance, operating and maintenance costs, any of which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\nAdditionally, in 2021, the U.S. joined the international community at the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26). At the conclusion of COP26, the U.S. and nearly 200 other counties agreed to the Glasgow Climate Pact, committing to revisiting and strengthening their current emissions targets to 2030 in 2022 and finalizing the outstanding elements of the Paris Agreement.  In addition, our operations continue in countries around the world which are party to the Paris Agreement.  The implementation of current agreements and regulatory measures, as well as any future agreements or measures addressing climate change and GHG emissions, may adversely impact the demand for our products, impose taxes on our products or operations or require us to purchase emission credits or reduce emission of GHGs from our operations.  As a result, we may experience declines in commodity prices or incur substantial capital expenditures and compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs, any of which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\nIn September 2021, we announced an improvement to our Paris-aligned climate risk framework, whereby we committed to an improvement to our targets for reduc ing our scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity on both a gross operated and net equity basis and reaffirmed our commitment to advocate for the reduction of scope 3 emissions through our support for a U.S. carbon price.  Compliance with, and achievement of, climate change-related internal initiatives such as the foregoing  may increase costs, require  us to purchase emission credits, or limit or impact our business plans.  If we are not successful in select internal initiatives,  we may be adversely affected and potentially need to reduce economic end-of-field life of certain assets and impair associated net book value.\n\nIncreasing attention to global climate change has also resulted in pressure from and upon stockholders, financial institutions and/or financial markets to modify their relationships with oil and gas companies and to limit investments and/or funding to such companies.  For example, Harvard University announced in September 2021 that it will stop investing  its $42 billion endowment in fossil fuels and will let its current  investments expire without renewal.  As public pressure continues to mount, our access to capital on terms we find favorable (if it is available at all) may be limited and our costs may increase, our reputation could be damaged or our business and results of operations may be otherwise adversely affected.\n\nFurthermore, increasing attention to global climate change has resulted in an increased likelihood of governmental investigations and private litigation, which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business. Beginning in 2017, cities, counties, governments and other entities in several states in the U.S. have filed lawsuits against oil and gas companies, including ConocoPhillips, seeking compensatory damages and equitable relief to",

International agreements and national, regional, and state legislation and regulatory measures that aim to directly or indirectly limit or reduce GHG emissions are in various stages of implementation. The company is currently subject to implemented programs in certain jurisdictions such as the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard program, the European Union Emissions Trading System, and the California cap-and-trade program and low carbon fuel standard obligations. Further, the Paris Agreement went into effect in November 2016, and a number of countries in which we operate may adopt additional policies to meet their Paris Agreement goals. Globally, multiple jurisdictions are considering adopting or are in the process of implementing laws or regulations to directly regulate GHG emissions through similar or other mechanisms, such as a carbon tax, a cap-and-trade program,  or  performance  standards,  or  to  indirectly  advance  reduction  of  GHG  emissions  through  restrictive  permitting,  trade tariffs,  minimum  renewable  usage  requirements,  increased  GHG  reporting  and  climate-related  disclosure  requirements,  or  tax advantages or other incentives to promote the use of alternative energy, fuel sources or lower-carbon technologies. GHG emissions that may be directly regulated through such efforts include, among others, those associated with the company's exploration and production of hydrocarbons; the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil; power generation; the conversion of crude  oil  and  natural  gas  into  refined  hydrocarbon  products;  the  processing,  liquefaction,  and  regasification  of  natural  gas;  the transportation  of  crude  oil,  natural  gas,  and  related  products;  and  customers'  use  of  the  company's  hydrocarbon  products. Indirect  regulation of GHG emissions could include, among other things, bans or restrictions on technologies or products that use the company's hydrocarbon products. Many of these actions, as well as customers' preferences and use of the company's products or substitute products, and actions taken by the company's competitors in response to legislation and regulations, are beyond the company's control.\n\nSimilar  to  any  significant  changes  in  the  regulatory  environment,  GHG  emissions  and  climate  change-related  legislation, regulation, or other government actions may curtail profitability in the oil and gas sector, or render the extraction of the company's hydrocarbon resources economically infeasible. In particular, GHG  emissions-related legislation, regulations, and other government actions and shifting customer preferences and other private efforts aimed at reducing GHG emissions may result in increased and substantial capital, compliance, operating, and maintenance costs and could, among other things, reduce demand for hydrocarbons and the company's hydrocarbon-based products; increase demand for lower carbon products and alternative energy sources;  make  the  company's  products  more  expensive;  adversely  affect  the  economic  feasibility  of  the  company's  resources; impact  or  limit  our  business  plans;  and  adversely  affect  the  company's  sales  volumes,  revenues,  margins  and  reputation.  The ultimate  effect  of  international  agreements;  national,  regional,  and  state  legislation  and  regulation;  and  government  and  private actions related to GHG emissions and climate change on the company's financial performance, and the timing of these effects, will depend on a number of factors. Such factors include, among others, the sectors covered, the GHG emissions reductions required, the  extent  to  which Chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits and the extent to which  the  company  is  able  to  recover  the  costs  incurred  through  the  pricing  of  the  company's  products  in  the  competitive marketplace. Further, the ultimate impact of GHG emissions and climate change-related agreements, legislation, regulation, and government actions  on  the  company's  financial  performance  is  highly  uncertain  because  the  company  is  unable  to  predict  with certainty, for a multitude of individual jurisdictions, the outcome of political decision-making processes, including the actual laws and regulations enacted, the variables and tradeoffs that inevitably occur in connection with such processes, and market conditions.\n\nIncreasing attention to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters may impact our business Increasing attention to ESG matters, including those related to climate change and sustainability, increasing societal, investor and legislative pressure on companies to address ESG matters, and potential customer use of substitutes to Chevron's products may result in increased costs, reduced demand for our products, reduced profits, increased investigations and litigation or threats thereof, negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets, and damage to our reputation. Increasing attention to climate change, for example, may result in demand shifts for our hydrocarbon products and additional governmental investigations and private litigation, or threats thereof,  against  the  company.

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips acquired approximately 225,000 net acres in the Delaware Basin from Shell in December 2021, which significantly expanded its footprint in a key unconventional play. This acquisition likely reinforced ConocoPhillips' commitment to the basin, as evidenced by its corporate structure and strategic focus on resource-rich North American unconventional plays. Meanwhile, Chevron reported that higher commodity prices in 2021 led to a 107 million barrel increase in U.S. proved reserves, with the Midland and Delaware basins being key contributors. This reserve growth, combined with Chevron's active extensions and discoveries in the Delaware Basin, suggests that Chevron also increased its development activity in the region. Therefore, both companies were incentivized to deepen their investment in the Delaware Basin, with ConocoPhillips expanding via acquisitions and Chevron through organic reserve growth driven by higher prices and exploration success.",

Total company production for the year was 1,567 MBOED.\n\nConocoPhillips was incorporated in the state of Delaware on November 16, 2001, in connection with, and in anticipation of, the merger between Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Company.  The merger between Conoco and Phillips was consummated on August 30, 2002.  In April 2012, ConocoPhillips completed the separation of the downstream business into an independent, publicly traded energy company, Phillips 66.\n\nOn January 15, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Concho Resources Inc. (Concho), an independent oil and gas exploration and production company with operations in New Mexico and West Texas  focused on the Permian Basin.  For additional information related to this transaction, see Note 3 .\n\nOn December 1, 2021, we completed our acquisition of Shell Enterprises LLC's (Shell) assets in the Delaware Basin. Assets acquired include approximately 225,000 net acres of producing properties located entirely in Texas.  For additional information related to this transaction, see Note 3 .\n\n## Segment and Geographic Information\n\nWe manage our operations through six operating segments, defined by geographic region: Alaska; Lower 48; Canada; Europe, Middle East and North Africa; Asia Pacific; and Other International.  For operating segment and geographic information, see Note 23 .\n\nWe explore for,  produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and NGLs on a worldwide basis.

      "answer": "To calculate the number of days of ConocoPhillips' NGL production that could be supported by Chevron's annual reserve additions: Chevron added 107 million barrels of U.S. proved reserves in 2021, primarily from activity in the Delaware Basin. ConocoPhillips reports an average daily production of 27 million barrels per day (NGL MBD) from the Delaware Basin. Dividing Chevron's annual reserve addition by ConocoPhillips' daily production gives 107,000,000 \u00f7 27,000,000 = approximately 3.96 days.

      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From ConocoPhillips' 10-K filing, we identify that NFE4 (a joint venture with QatarEnergy) has a 12.5% interest in the NFE LNG project, and NFS3 (also a joint venture with QatarEnergy) has a 25% interest in the NFS LNG project. However, the filing does not explicitly state the gross LNG capacity of these projects.",
        "Step 2: From ExxonMobil's 10-K filing, we learn that through its joint ventures with QatarEnergy, ExxonMobil participated in 52.3 million metric tons per year of gross LNG capacity as of year-end 2023.",
        "Step 3: Since both companies have joint ventures with QatarEnergy in Qatar\u2019s LNG sector, and only ExxonMobil explicitly reports its share of the gross LNG capacity, we conclude that the total gross LNG capacity associated with both companies through QatarEnergy is at least 52.3 million metric tons per year, with ConocoPhillips' contribution not quantified in the provided excerpt.",
        "Step 4: Given the explicit data in the ExxonMobil filing and the lack of full capacity details in the ConocoPhillips filing, the question is grounded in the 52.3 million metric tons per year figure from ExxonMobil and the context of shared QatarEnergy LNG investments."

Meanwhile, Chevron experienced a net decrease of 275 million BOE in proved reserves in the Delaware Basin in 2023, primarily due to portfolio optimization and reservoir performance issues.

      "answer": "Chevron reports its Qatar operations in terms of average daily net production, specifying that QatarEnergy LNG produces 13 thousand barrels per day (MBD) of crude oil, 8 MBD of natural gas liquids (NGL), and 374 million cubic feet per day (MMCFD) of natural gas, resulting in a total of 83 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED) at a 30% interest. ExxonMobil, on the other hand, reports its Qatar operations in terms of gross capacity, noting participation in 52.3 million metric tons per year of liquefied natural gas (LNG) capacity and 3.4 billion cubic feet per day of flowing gas capacity. Chevron provides net production figures across hydrocarbon types, while ExxonMobil focuses on LNG and gas capacity metrics without disclosing net production volumes.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Chevron's average daily net production in Qatar includes 13 MBD crude oil, 8 MBD NGL, 374 MMCFD natural gas, totaling 83 MBOED at a 30% interest.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - ExxonMobil reports 52.3 million metric tons per year of LNG capacity and 3.4 billion cubic feet per day of flowing gas capacity in Qatar, without net production figures.",

Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, is the operator of APLNG's production and pipeline system, while we operate the LNG facility.\n\nIn 2012, APLNG executed an $8.5 billion project finance facility that became non-recourse following financial completion in 2017. The facility is currently composed of a financing agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a commercial bank facility and two United States Private Placement note facilities. APLNG principal and interest payments commenced in March 2017 and are scheduled to occur bi-annually until September 2030. At December 31, 2024, a balance of $4.0 billion was outstanding on the facilities. See Note 9 .\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investment in APLNG was approximately $5.0 billion.\n\n## PALNG\n\nPALNG is a joint venture for the development of a large-scale LNG facility. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investment in PALNG was approximately $1.5 billion. See Note 3 .\n\n## N3\n\nN3 is a joint venture that owns an integrated large-scale LNG project located in Qatar. We have terminal and pipeline use agreements with Golden Pass LNG Terminal and affiliated Golden Pass Pipeline near Sabine Pass, Texas, intended to provide us with terminal and pipeline capacity for the receipt, storage and regasification of LNG purchased from N3. Currently, the LNG from N3 is being sold to markets outside of the U.S.\n\n## NFE4\n\nNFE4 is a joint venture participating in the NFE LNG project. NFE4 has a 12.5 percent interest in the NFE project. See Note 3 .\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, we were notified that an affiliate of QatarEnergy transferred a 5 percent joint venture interest in NFE4 to an affiliate of China National Petroleum Corporation. As a result, we have concluded NFE4 is a VIE as it currently requires advances from the joint venture participants to fund the project. We are not the primary beneficiary of the VIE because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance of NFE4, which involve activities related to the production and commercialization of natural gas, as well as LNG processing and export marketing. As a result, we do not consolidate NFE4, and it is accounted for under the equity method. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity is included in the total carrying value of our equity method investments in Qatar. This equity together with the guarantee is the only financial support that we have provided NFE4. See Note 9 .\n\n## NFS3\n\nNFS3 is a joint venture participating in the NFS LNG project. NFS3 has a 25 percent interest in the NFS project. See Note 3 .\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investments in Qatar was approximately $1.4 billion.\n\n## Loans\n\nAs part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities. Included in such activity are loans to certain affiliated and non-affiliated companies.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, there were no outstanding loans to affiliated companies.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n92",

          "chunk_text": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## BUSINESS RESULTS\n\n## Upstream\n\nExxonMobil has a diverse growth portfolio of exploration and development opportunities, which allows the Corporation to be selective in our investments, maximizing shareholder value and mitigating political and technical risks. ExxonMobil's competitive strengths enable the Upstream's business strategy, which is focused on developing  an  industry-leading  portfolio  underpinned  by  advantaged  growth  projects,  applying  ExxonMobil's  technology  to  enhance  value  and  improve development efficiency, and leveraging the unique capabilities of the Company's global projects organization to deliver projects on time and in line with budgets.\n\nThe Upstream capital program is focused on low cost-of-supply opportunities. ExxonMobil has a strong pipeline of development projects, including continued growth in Guyana and the Permian Basin, as well as LNG expansion opportunities in Qatar, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea, and the United States. As future development projects and drilling activities bring new production online, the Corporation expects a shift in the geographic mix and in the type of opportunities from which volumes are produced. Based on the current investment plans, the proportion of oil-equivalent production from the Americas is generally expected to increase over the next several years. Currently about two thirds of the Corporation's global production comes from unconventional, deepwater, and LNG  resources. This proportion is generally expected to grow.\n\nThe Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups, operational outages, reservoir performance, regulatory changes, the impact of fiscal and commercial terms, asset sales, weather events, price effects on production sharing contracts, changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment, international trade patterns and relations, and other factors described in Item 1A.\n\nIn 2024, crude and gas prices were within the pre-COVID 10-year historical range (2010-2019). ExxonMobil believes prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand, with the demand side largely being a function of general economic activities, levels of prosperity, technology advances, consumer preference, and government policies. On the supply side, prices may be significantly impacted by political events, the actions of OPEC or OPEC+ and other large government resource owners, alternative energy sources, and other factors.\n\n## Key Recent Events\n\nGuyana: Liza Destiny, Liza Unity and Prosperity floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessels continued to produce above investment basis capacity in 2024. The combined gross production from the three operating vessels exceeded 615 thousand barrels of oil per day (kbd) in 2024 and exceeded 650 kbd in the fourth quarter of 2024. Y ellowtail, Uaru and Whiptail, the fourth, fifth and six th developments on the Stabroek Block, respectively, are progressing on schedule and each has an investment basis capacity of approximately 250 kbd. We announced plans for two additional developments and anticipate eight FPSO vessels will be in operation on the Stabroek Block by year-end 2030. We are working with the government of Guyana to secure regulatory approvals for the seventh project.\n\nPermian: ExxonMobil successfully closed the Pioneer Natural Resources Company (Pioneer) acquisition in May 2024, significantly increasing our Permian footprint. Total production volumes averaged approximately 1,185 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day (koebd) in 2024, approximately 570 koebd higher than the previous year. ExxonMobil operations continue to deliver industry-leading capital efficiency and cost performance by leveraging scale, integration, and technology. Examples include deploying ExxonMobil cube design and proprietary proppant as well as leading capabilities and technology in drilling and completions. ExxonMobil remains on track to achieve industry-leading plans of Scope 1 and 2 net zero greenhouse gas emissions in the heritage Permian Basin unconventional operated assets by 2030, and in Pioneer assets by 2035. ExxonMobil expects to roughly double production in the Permian Basin to approximately 2.3 Moebd by 2030. (1)\n\nLNG: ExxonMobil continued work on LNG growth projects in 2024. Production commenced from two new gas wells in Papua New G uinea (PNG ), marking completion of the Angore project and additional supply to support LNG  export from the PNG  LNG  joint venture. In Mozambique, the Rovuma LNG  project began the front-end engineering and design stage in 2024, in support of a final investment decision in 2026, to develop the Area 4 offshore gas resources. Construction continues on the Golden Pass LNG project with Train 1 mechanical completion and first LNG production expected at the end of 2025.\n\nHeritage Permian Basin assets exclude assets acquired as part of the acquisition of Pioneer that closed May 3, 2024.

      "answer": "Chevron has a 36.4 percent interest in Angola LNG Limited, and ExxonMobil reported $3,207 million in long-lived assets in Angola as of December 31, 2021. Since Chevron's interest in Angola LNG Limited is an equity investment and ExxonMobil's figure represents total long-lived assets in Angola (not equity-based), the question asks for a direct sum of the two distinct financial exposures in Angola. Therefore, the combined value is $3,207 million from ExxonMobil plus the face value of Chevron\u2019s equity stake in Angola LNG Limited (which is not numerically provided but is explicitly stated as 36.4% ownership).",

At December 31, 2021, the company's carrying value of its investment in TCO was about $100 higher than the amount of underlying equity in TCO's net assets. This difference results from Chevron acquiring a portion of its interest in TCO at a value greater than the underlying book value for that portion of TCO's net assets. Included in the investment is a loan to TCO to fund the development of the FGP/WPMP with a balance of $4,500.\n\nPetropiar Chevron has a 30 percent interest in Petropiar, a joint stock company which operates the heavy oil Huyapari Field and upgrading project in Venezuela's Orinoco Belt. In 2020, the company fully impaired its investments in the Petropiar affiliate and, effective July 1, 2020, began accounting for this venture as a non-equity method investment.\n\nPetroboscan Chevron  has  a  39.2  percent  interest  in  Petroboscan,  a  joint  stock  company  which  operates  the  Boscan  Field  in Venezuela.  In  2020,  the  company  fully  impaired  its  investments  in  the  Petroboscan  affiliate  and,  effective  July  1,  2020,  began accounting  for  this  venture  as  a  non-equity  method  investment.  The  company  also  has  an  outstanding  long-term  loan  to Petroboscan of $560, which has been fully provisioned for at year-end 2021.\n\nCaspian Pipeline Consortium Chevron has a 15 percent interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which provides the critical export route for crude oil from both TCO and Karachaganak.\n\nAngola  LNG Limited Chevron  has  a  36.4  percent  interest  in Angola  LNG  Limited,  which  processes  and  liquefies  natural  gas produced in Angola for delivery to international markets.\n\nChevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC Chevron owns 50 percent of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC. The other half is owned by Phillips 66.\n\nGS Caltex Corporation Chevron owns 50 percent of GS Caltex Corporation, a joint venture with GS Energy in South Korea. The joint venture imports, refines and markets petroleum products, petrochemicals and lubricants.",

Earnings were positively impacted by:\n\n- Higher realized natural gas, crude oil and NGL prices.\n- Higher LNG sales prices, reflected in equity in earnings of affiliates.\n- Higher sales volumes of crude oil and LNG.\n\nEarnings were negatively impacted by:\n\n- Higher taxes.\n- Higher DD&amp;A expenses and production and operating expenses.  Partly offsetting the increase in DD&amp;A expenses were lower rates from positive reserve revisions.\n\n## Consolidated Production\n\nAverage consolidated production increased 39 MBOED in 2021, compared with 2020.  The consolidated production increase was primarily due to:\n\n- Higher production in Libya due to the absence of a forced shutdown of the Es Sider export terminal and other eastern export terminals.\n- Improved well performance in Norway.\n- New production from Norway drilling activities, including our Tor II redevelopment project which achieved full production in 2021.\n\nThese production increases were partly offset by:\n\n- Normal field decline.",

          "chunk_text": "The historical cost basis of our 37.5 percent share of net assets on the books of APLNG was $ 5,523 million, resulting in a basis difference of $ 51 million on our books.  The basis difference, which is substantially all associated with PP&amp;E and subject to amortization, has been allocated on a relative fair value basis to individual production license areas owned by APLNG.  Any future additional payments are expected to be allocated in a similar manner.  As the joint venture produces natural gas from each license, we amortize the basis difference allocated to that license using the unit-of-production  method.  Included in net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips for 2021, 2020 and 2019 was after-tax expense of $39 million, $41 million and $36 million, respectively,  representing the amortization of this basis difference on currently  producing licenses.\n\n## QG3\n\nQG3 is a joint venture that owns an integrated large-scale LNG project located in Qatar.  We provided project financing, with a current outstanding balance of $ 114 million as described below under 'Loans.'  At December 31, 2021, the book value of our equity method investment in QG3, excluding the project financing, was $ 736 million. We have terminal and pipeline use agreements with Golden Pass LNG Terminal and affiliated Golden Pass Pipeline near Sabine Pass, Texas, intended to provide us with terminal and pipeline capacity for the receipt, storage and regasification of LNG purchased from QG3.  We previously held a12.4 percent interest in Golden Pass LNG Terminal and Golden Pass Pipeline, but we sold those interests in the second quarter of 2019 while retaining the basic use agreements.  Currently, the LNG from QG3 is being sold to markets outside of the U.S. See Note 3 .\n\n## Loans\n\nAs part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities.  Included in such activity are loans to certain affiliated and non-affiliated companies.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, significant loans to affiliated companies include $114 million in project financing to QG3 which is recorded within the 'Accounts  and notes receivable-related parties' line on our consolidated balance sheet.  QG3 secured project financing of $ 4.0 billion in December 2005, consisting of $1.3 billion of loans from export credit agencies (ECA), $ 1.5 billion from commercial banks and $1.2 billion from ConocoPhillips.  The ConocoPhillips loan facilities have substantially the same terms as the ECA and commercial bank facilities.  On December 15, 2011, QG3 achieved financial completion and all project loan facilities became nonrecourse to the project participants. Semi-annual repayments began in January 2011 and will extend through July 2022.\n\n## Note 5-Investment in Cenovus Energy\n\nOur investment in Cenovus Energy (CVE) common shares is carried on our balance sheet at fair value.\n\n",
