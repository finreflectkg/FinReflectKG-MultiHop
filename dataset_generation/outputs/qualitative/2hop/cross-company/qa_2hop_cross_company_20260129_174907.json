      "question": "How does the volatility in capital markets specifically impact both American Express's capital adequacy strategy and BlackRock's business performance, and what are the financial implications for each company's approach to managing this macroeconomic risk?",
      "answer": "American Express specifically notes that volatility in capital markets influences its balance sheet management and capital adequacy strategy, prompting the company to maintain capital levels above regulatory minimums, particularly within a 10 to 11 percent target range for its Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) risk-based capital ratio. This approach ensures flexibility to support future business growth and withstand adverse market conditions. Meanwhile, BlackRock identifies capital markets volatility as a key risk factor that could materially affect its business performance, particularly by influencing demand for its investment products and the value of its $10.0 trillion in assets under management (AUM) as of December 31, 2023. The financial implication for American Express is a more conservative capital strategy to maintain regulatory and investor confidence, while for BlackRock, the impact is more direct on revenue and asset valuation, as its business model is highly dependent on market performance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - American Express's capital adequacy strategy is shaped by capital markets volatility, with a CET1 target range of 10 to 11 percent to maintain flexibility and support growth.",

      "question": "How do the compensation equity reviews at American Express and BlackRock differ in terms of stated outcomes, and what does this imply about their respective approaches to pay equity?",
      "answer": "American Express explicitly states that after conducting compensation equity reviews, they made adjustments where inconsistencies were found and believe they maintained 100% pay equity across genders globally and across races and ethnicities in the United States in 2023. In contrast, while BlackRock describes a strong pay-for-performance culture and a comprehensive compensation process, it does not state any specific outcome metrics or assurance of pay equity across gender or racial lines. This implies that American Express takes a more outcome-focused and quantitatively transparent approach to pay equity, whereas BlackRock emphasizes process and policy without specifying measurable results.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From AXP_10k_2023.pdf, American Express conducted reviews of compensation practices and made adjustments where inconsistencies were found, resulting in a claim of 100% pay equity globally across genders and in the U.S. across races and ethnicities.",
        "Step 2: From BLK_10k_2023.pdf, BlackRock describes its compensation philosophy as aligned with performance and market benchmarks but does not provide specific outcomes or assurance regarding pay equity across demographic groups.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the differences in stated outcomes: AXP provides a definitive metric (100% pay equity), while BLK does not, indicating different levels of transparency and outcome-based accountability in their approaches to compensation equity."

Similarly, Visa states that a copy of any omitted schedule will be furnished supplementally to the SEC upon request, with the possibility that the parties may request confidential treatment under Rule 24b-2 of the Exchange Act for any document so furnished.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Schwab omits schedules pursuant to Item 601(b)(2) and agrees to furnish supplementally a copy of such schedules to the SEC upon request.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Visa also omits schedules under Item 601(b)(2) and states it will furnish omitted schedules upon request, with potential confidential treatment under Rule 24b-2.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies rely on the same regulatory provision (Item 601(b)(2)) to omit schedules, and both commit to providing the omitted materials to the SEC upon request, though Visa also notes the potential for confidential treatment."

      "question": "What is the combined carrying value of preferred stock for both Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Visa (V) in 2022, and how does the structure of their preferred stock offerings differ based on the series and valuation methods disclosed in their respective 10-K filings?",
      "answer": "The combined carrying value of preferred stock for Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Visa (V) in 2022 is $11,226 million. This is calculated by adding the total carrying value of preferred stock from Schwab in 2022, which is $9,954 million, to Visa\u2019s book value of preferred stock in 2022, which is $1,272 million. Schwab\u2019s preferred stock consists of multiple series (A through J) with fixed or fixed-to-floating rate structures, each having a $1,000 or $100,000 liquidation preference per share and specific redemption and reset dates. In contrast, Visa\u2019s preferred stock is categorized into Series B and Series C, with the primary distinction being their as-converted and book values, and no explicit rate or reset details provided in the evidence. The structure of Schwab\u2019s preferred stock is more complex and diversified across various series, while Visa\u2019s preferred stock disclosures reflect a simpler bifurcation into two series with significant differences in their as-converted versus book values.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Schwab's total preferred stock carrying value at December 31, 2022, is $9,954 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Visa's total book value of preferred stock as of September 30, 2022, is $1,272 million.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the combined carrying value by summing the values from Step 1 and Step 2: $9,954 million + $1,272 million = $11,226 million.",
        "Step 4: Analyze the structure of Schwab's preferred stock, which includes multiple series (A through J) with fixed or fixed-to-floating rate structures, specific redemption dates, and reset mechanisms.",
        "Step 5: Analyze the structure of Visa's preferred stock, which is divided into Series B and Series C, with disclosed as-converted and book values but without detailed rate or reset information.",
        "Step 6: Contrast the two structures, noting that Schwab\u2019s preferred stock offerings are more granular and structured with specific financial terms, while Visa\u2019s disclosures focus on broader series classifications and valuation differences."

      "question": "How does Schwab's and Visa's exposure to settlement risk differ in terms of the mechanisms that mitigate potential losses, given Schwab's requirement for client deposits in excess of regulatory requirements and Visa's indemnification obligations tied to unsettled payment transactions?",
      "answer": "Schwab mitigates settlement risk by requiring client deposits in excess of regulatory requirements for certain trades, which significantly reduces the likelihood of losses from client failure to fulfill obligations, and thus no liability has been recognized. In contrast, Visa faces settlement risk due to its indemnification obligations for unsettled Visa card payment transactions, where it may not recover payments made in the event of client insolvency or settlement failure, exposing it to potential liquidity and financial loss. Therefore, Schwab's risk is largely neutralized by its preemptive deposit requirements, while Visa's risk remains active and contingent on the creditworthiness and settlement performance of its clients.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A (Schwab) - 'We have established procedures to reduce this risk by requiring deposits from clients in excess of amounts prescribed by regulatory requirements for certain types of trades, and therefore the potential to make payments under these client transactions is remote. Accordingly, no liability has been recognized for these transactions.'",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B (Visa) - 'Our indemnification exposure is generally limited to the amount of unsettled Visa card payment transactions at any point in time and any subsequent amounts that may fall due relating to adjustments for previously processed transactions.' and 'Even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure or insolvency, we may be unable to recover the amount of such payment.'",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Schwab\u2019s risk is mitigated through excess client deposits, eliminating the need to recognize a liability, whereas Visa\u2019s settlement risk is active and tied to unsettled transactions, with potential for unrecoverable loss."

In certain instances, we may indemnify issuers or acquirers in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system. This indemnification creates settlement risk for us due to the timing difference between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Our indemnification exposure is generally limited to the amount of unsettled Visa card payment transactions at any point in time and any subsequent amounts that may fall due relating to adjustments for previously processed transactions. Changes in the credit standing of our clients or concurrent settlement failures or insolvencies involving  more  than  one  of  our  largest  clients,  several  of  our  smaller  clients,  or  systemic  operational  failures  could expose us to liquidity risk, and negatively impact our financial position. Even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure or insolvency, we may be unable to recover the amount of such payment. This could expose us to significant  losses  and  harm  our  business.  See Note  12-Settlement  Guarantee  Management to  our  consolidated financial statements included in Item 8-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.\n\n## Technology and Cybersecurity Risks\n\n## Failure to anticipate, adapt to, or keep pace with, new technologies in the payments industry could harm our business and impact future growth.\n\nThe  global  payments  industry  is  undergoing  significant  and  rapid  technological  change,  including  increased proliferation of mobile and other proximity and in-app payment technologies, ecommerce, tokenization, cryptocurrencies, distributed ledger and blockchain technologies, cloud-based encryption and authorization, and new authentication technologies such as biometrics, FIDO 2.0, 3D Secure 2.0 and dynamic cardholder verification values or dCVV2. As  a  result,  we  expect  new  services  and  technologies  to  continue  to  emerge  and  evolve,  including  those developed by Visa such as our new flows offerings. In addition to our own initiatives and innovations, we work closely with third parties, including potential competitors, for the development of, and access to, new technologies. It is difficult, however,  to  predict  which  technological  developments  or  innovations  will  become  widely  adopted  and  how  those technologies  may  be  regulated.  Moreover,  some  of  the  new  technologies  could  be  subject  to  intellectual  propertyrelated  lawsuits  or  claims,  potentially  impacting  our  development  efforts  and/or  requiring  us  to  obtain  licenses, implement  design  changes  or  discontinue  our  use.  If  we  or  our  partners  fail  to  adapt  and  keep  pace  with  new technologies in the payments space in a timely manner, it could harm our ability to compete, decrease the value of our products and services to our clients, impact our intellectual property or licensing rights, harm our business and impact our future growth.\n\n## A disruption, failure or breach of our networks or systems, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could harm our business.\n\nOur cybersecurity and processing systems, as well as those of financial institutions, merchants and third-party service providers, have experienced and may continue to experience errors, interruptions, delays or damage from a number of causes, including power outages, hardware, software and network failures, computer viruses, ransomware, malware  or  other  destructive  software,  internal  design,  manual  or  user  errors,  cyber-attacks,  terrorism,  workplace violence  or  wrongdoing,  catastrophic  events,  natural  disasters,  severe  weather  conditions  and  other  effects  from climate change. In addition, there is risk that third party suppliers of hardware and infrastructure required to operate our data centers and support employee productivity could be impacted by supply chain disruptions, such as manufacturing, shipping delays, and service disruption due to cyber-attacks. An extended supply chain or service disruption could also impact processing or delivery of technology services.\n\nFurthermore, our visibility  and  role  in  the  global  payments  industry  also  puts  our  company  at  a  greater  risk  of being targeted by hackers. In the normal course of our business, we have been the target of malicious cyber-attack attempts. For example, in response to U.S. and European sanctions against Russia earlier this year, we saw increased cyber-threats from state sponsored or nation-state actors. We have been, and may continue to be, impacted by attacks and data security breaches of financial institutions, merchants, and third-party service providers. We are also aware of instances  where  nation  states  have  sponsored  attacks  against  some  of  our  financial  institution  clients,  and  other instances where merchants and issuers have encountered substantial data",

      "question": "What is the combined notional amount of written credit default swaps held by Bank of America (BAC) and MetLife (MET) as of December 31, 2023, and how does each company's utilization of these instruments differ in terms of hedging designation?",
      "answer": "The combined notional amount of written credit default swaps held by Bank of America (BAC) and MetLife (MET) as of December 31, 2023, is $289.1 billion (BAC) + $0 billion (MET) = $289.1 billion. Bank of America reports a notional amount of $289.1 billion in written credit default swaps and accounts for them as part of its credit derivatives portfolio. MetLife, although it actively utilizes credit default swaps, only enters into purchased credit default swaps for hedging credit risk and does not report any notional amount for written credit default swaps. Furthermore, MetLife utilizes these instruments in nonqualifying hedging relationships, while BAC does not specify a hedging designation for its written credit default swaps.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Bank of America (BAC) discloses a notional amount of $289.1 billion in written credit default swaps as of December 31, 2023.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - MetLife (MET) utilizes credit default swaps but only enters into purchased credit default swaps and does not report any notional amount for written credit default swaps.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Combine the notional amounts from both companies and contrast their utilization: BAC holds written credit default swaps, while MET only purchases them and uses them in nonqualifying hedging relationships."

Derivatives (continued)\n\nTo  a  lesser  ex tent,  the  Company  uses  ex change-traded  currency  futures  to  hedge  currency  mismatches  between  assets  and  liabilities,  and  to  hedge  minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity products issued by the Company. The Company utilizes exchange-traded currency futures in nonqualifying hedging relationships.\n\n## Credit Derivatives\n\nThe Company enters into purchased credit default swaps to hedge against credit-related changes in the value of its investments. In a credit default swap transaction, the Company agrees with another party to pay, at specified intervals, a premium to hedge credit risk. If a credit event occurs, as defined by the contract, the contract may be cash settled or it may be settled gross by the delivery of par quantities of the referenced investment equal to the specified swap notional amount in exchange for the payment of cash amounts by the counterparty equal to the par value of the investment surrendered. Credit events vary by type of issuer but typically include bankruptcy, failure  to  pay  debt  obligations  and  involuntary  restructuring  for  corporate  obligors,  as  well  as  repudiation,  moratorium  or  governmental  intervention  for  sovereign obligors. In each case, payout on a credit default swap is triggered only after the relevant third party, Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee determines that a credit event has occurred. The Company utilizes credit default swaps in nonqualifying hedging relationships.\n\nThe Company enters into written credit default swaps to synthetically create credit investments that are either more expensive to acquire or otherwise unavailable in the cash markets. These transactions are a combination of a derivative and one or more cash instruments, such as U.S. government and agency, or other fixed maturity securities AFS. These credit default swaps are not designated as hedging instruments.\n\nThe Company enters into forwards to lock in the price to be paid for forward purchases of certain securities. The price is agreed upon at the time of the contract and payment for the contract is made at a specified future date. When the primary purpose of entering into these transactions is to hedge against the risk of changes in purchase price due to changes in credit spreads, the Company designates these transactions as credit forwards. The Company utilizes credit forwards in cash flow hedging relationships.\n\n## Equity Derivatives\n\nThe Company uses a variety of equity derivatives to reduce its exposure to equity market risk, including equity index options, equity variance swaps, exchangetraded equity futures and equity total return swaps.\n\nEquity index options are used by the Company primarily to hedge minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity products issued by the Company. To hedge against changes in equity indices, the Company enters into contracts to sell the underlying equity index within a limited time at a contracted price. The contracts will be net settled in cash based on differentials in the indices at the time of ex ercise and the strike price. Certain of these contracts may also contain settlement provisions linked to interest rates. In certain instances, the Company may enter into a combination of transactions to hedge changes in equity indices within a pre-determined range through the purchase and sale of options. The Company utilizes equity index options in nonqualifying hedging relationships.\n\nEquity variance swaps are used by the Company primarily to hedge minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity products issued by the Company. In an equity variance swap, the Company agrees with another party to exchange amounts in the future, based on changes in equity volatility over a defined period. The Company utilizes equity variance swaps in nonqualifying hedging relationships.\n\nIn exchange-traded equity futures transactions, the Company agrees to purchase or sell a specified number of contracts, the value of which is determined by the different classes of equity securities, to post variation margin on a daily basis in an amount equal to the difference in the daily market values of those contracts and to pledge initial margin based on futures exchange requirements. The Company enters into exchange-traded futures with regulated futures commission merchants that are members of the exchange. Exchange-traded equity futures are used primarily to hedge minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity products issued by the Company. The Company utilizes exchange-traded equity futures in nonqualifying hedging relationships.",

      "answer": "BAC explicitly reports the fair value of its Non-Agency RMBS at $533 million with a yield of 11.48%, included under 'Non-agency residential' in the Mortgage-backed securities section. In contrast, MET does not disclose the fair value of non-agency RMBS directly; instead, it presents these securities using NAIC designations for modeled securities, without specifying a dollar value or yield. This highlights a divergence in transparency and classification methodology between the two financial institutions regarding the same type of asset.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - BAC reports the fair value of its Non-Agency RMBS at $533 million with an 11.48% yield under the 'Non-agency residential' category in the Mortgage-backed securities section.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - MET states that it presents non-agency RMBS using NAIC designations for modeled securities, without specifying a dollar value or yield.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The contrast lies in BAC's explicit fair value disclosure of Non-Agency RMBS versus MET's use of NAIC designations without directly stating values, reflecting differing approaches to transparency and classification."

      "question": "How does the impact of poor investment performance on performance fee volatility differ between BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, given their respective exposures and revenue structures?",
      "answer": "BlackRock's performance fees, which amounted to $1.2 billion or 6% of total revenue in 2024, are expected to become more volatile due to the increasing proportion of private markets products in its performance fee-generating assets, including from the GIP Acquisition and proposed HPS Acquisition. These private market products result in performance fees being recognized over longer multi-year periods compared to more liquid products, thereby increasing earnings volatility. In contrast, Goldman Sachs highlights that poor investment performance could lead to client shifts toward products with lower fees or alternative offerings, directly impacting its asset management and wealth management businesses. While Goldman does not quantify its performance fee exposure, it emphasizes that poor performance could reduce client inflows and increase withdrawals, affecting revenue stability. Thus, while both firms are exposed to investment performance risk, BlackRock's exposure is quantified and tied to structural changes in its asset composition, whereas Goldman's risk is more qualitative and tied to client behavior.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - BlackRock's performance fees represented $1.2 billion or 6% of total revenue in 2024, and volatility is expected to increase due to the growing share of private markets products.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both firms face volatility from poor investment performance, but the mechanism and quantification differ: BlackRock has a structural and measurable exposure tied to private markets and performance fee timing, while Goldman's exposure is more behavioral and qualitative, centered on client preference shifts."

          "chunk_text": "## Geopolitical unrest and other events outside of BlackRock's control could adversely affect the global economy or specific international, regional and domestic markets, which may cause BlackRock's AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\nGeopolitical risks, including those arising from  trade tension and/or the im position of trade tariffs, terrorist activity or acts of civil or international hostility, could have an adverse im pact on BlackR ock. For instance, the U kraine-R ussia and M iddle E ast conflicts have and m ay continue to result in geopolitical instability and adversely affect the global econom y, supply chains, specific m arkets and operations. Strategic com petition between the U S and C hina and resulting tensions and heightened levels of political polarization have also contributed to uncertainty in the geopolitical and regulatory landscapes. Sim ilarly, other events outside of BlackR ock's control, including the im pact of natural disasters, clim ate-related events, pandem ics or health crises m ay arise from  tim e to tim e and be accom panied by governm ental actions that m ay increase international tension or im pact the U S or global econom y in ways that are uncertain. Any such events and responses, including regulatory developm ents, m ay cause significant volatility and declines in the global m arkets, disproportionate im pacts to certain industries or sectors, disruptions to com m erce (including to econom ic activity, travel and supply chains), loss of life and property dam age, and m ay adversely affect the global econom y or capital m arkets, as well as the C om pany's products, operations, clients, vendors and em ployees, which m ay cause BlackR ock's AU M , revenue and earnings to decline. BlackR ock's exposure to geopolitical risks m ay be heightened to the extent such risks arise in countries in which BlackR ock currently operates or seeks to expand its presence.\n\n## Climate-related risks could adversely affect BlackRock's business, products, operations and clients, which may cause BlackRock's AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\nBlackR ock's business and those of its clients could be im pacted by clim ate-related risks. C lim ate-related risks m ay im pact BlackR ock through changes in the physical clim ate or from the process of transitioning to a low-carbon econom y. C lim ate-related physical risks arise from  the direct im pacts of a changing clim ate in the short- and long-term . Such risks m ay include the risks of extrem e weather events and changes in tem perature, which m ay dam age infrastructure and facilities, including BlackR ock's physical assets, as well as disrupt connectivity or supply chains. C lim ate-related transition risks arise from  exposure to the transition to a low-carbon econom y through policy, regulatory, technology and m arket changes. For instance, divergent existing and future clim ate regulations or guidance, as well as differing perspectives of stakeholders regarding clim ate im pacts, have affected and may continue to affect BlackR ock's business activities and reputation, increase scrutiny and com plicate com pliance requirem ents.\n\nClim ate-related physical and transition risks could also im pact BlackR ock's business both directly and indirectly through adverse im pacts to its clients' investm ents, including as a result of declines in asset values, changes in client preferences, increased regulatory and com pliance costs and significant business disruptions. Any of these risks m ay cause the Company's AUM , revenue and earnings to decline.\n\n## RISKS RE LATE D  TO IN VE STME N T PE R FO R MAN CE\n\nPoor investment performance could lead to the loss of clients and may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\nThe Com pany's m anagem ent believes that investm ent perform ance, including the efficient delivery of beta, is one of the m ost im portant factors for the growth and retention of AU M . Poor investm ent perform ance relative to applicable portfolio benchm arks, aggregate fee levels or com petitors m ay cause AU M , revenue and earnings to decline as a result of:\n\n- client withdrawals in favor of better perform ing products offered by com petitors;\n- client shifts to products that charge lower fees;\n- the dim inishing ability to attract additional funds from  existing and new clients;\n- reduced, m inim al or no perform ance fees;\n- an im pairm ent to the value of intangible assets and goodwill; or\n- a decrease in the valuations of seed and co-investm ent capital.\n\n## Performance fees may increase volatility of both revenue and earnings.\n\nA portion of BlackR ock's revenue is derived from  perform ance fees on investm ent advisory assignm ents. P erform ance fees represented $1.2 billion, or 6%, of total revenue for the year ended D ecem ber 31, 2024. Generally, the C om pany is entitled to a perform ance fee only if the agreem ent under which it is m anaging the assets provides for one and if returns on the related portfolio exceed agreed-upon periodic or cum ulative return targets. If these targets are not exceeded, a perform ance fee for that period will not be earned and, if targets are based on cum ulative returns, the C om pany m ay not earn perform ance fees in future periods. T he volatility of the C om pany's future revenue and earnings m ay also be affected due to private m arkets becom ing an increasing com ponent of the overall com position of the C om pany's perform ance fee generating assets, including from  the C om pany's acquisition of G I P  (the 'G I P  Acquisition') and its proposed acquisition of H P S (the 'H P S Acquisition'). I n particular, the C om pany expects that as it m anages m ore private m arkets products, its perform ance fees will generally be recognized over substantially longer m ulti-year periods than those associated with m ore liquid products.\n\n## Failure to identify errors in the quantitative models BlackRock utilizes to manage its business could adversely affect product performance and client relationships.\n\nBlackR ock em ploys various quantitative m odels to support its investm ent processes, including those related to risk assessm ent, portfolio m anagem ent, trading and hedging activities and product valuations. Any errors or lim itations in the underlying m odels, m odel inputs or assum ptions, including those from  third-party sources, as well as any failure of BlackR ock's governance, approval, testing, validation and m onitoring standards in respect of such m odels, m odel inputs or assum ptions, the failure to tim ely update such m odels, m odel inputs or assum ptions or errors in how such m odels are used, could have adverse effects on BlackR ock's business and reputation. These risks m ay be heightened by the rapid growth and complexity of new m odels, evolving data sets and standards, and m arket volatility.",

Goldman Sachs (GS), on the other hand, reports transfers between levels at the beginning of the reporting period in which they occur. Additionally, GS specifies that if a derivative is transferred into Level 3 during a reporting period, its entire gain or loss for the period is classified in Level 3, which affects the unrealized gains or losses still held at the reporting date. BLK focuses on the allocation of net income (loss) related to securities held by CIPs to NCI, while GS emphasizes that Level 3 classification includes derivatives with at least one significant Level 3 input, and that changes in observable inputs can still result in Level 3 classification.",

In som e instances, these operations are also affected by U S laws and regulations that have extra-territorial application.\n\nBelow is a sum m ary of certain international regulatory standards to which BlackR ock is subject. It is not m eant to be com prehensive as there are parallel legal and regulatory arrangem ents in force in m any jurisdictions where BlackR ock's subsidiaries conduct business.\n\nOf note am ong the various other international regulations to which BlackR ock is subject, are the extensive and com plex regulatory reporting requirem ents that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels (thresholds) across the holdings of m anaged funds and accounts and those of the C om pany.\n\n## Regulation in E ME A\n\nThe FCA currently regulates certain BlackR ock subsidiaries in the U K. It is also responsible for the conduct of business regulation of the U K branch of one of BlackR ock's U S subsidiaries. In addition, the P rudential R egulation Authority ('P R A') regulates one BlackR ock U K insurance subsidiary. Authorization by the F C A and (where relevant) the P R A is required to conduct certain financial services-related business in the U K under the F inancial Services and M arkets Act 2000 (the 'F SM A'). T he F C A's rules adopted under the F SM A govern the m ajority of a firm 's capital and liquidity resources requirem ents, senior m anagem ent arrangem ents, conduct of business and client assets requirem ents, interaction with clients, and system s and controls, whereas the rules of the P R A focus solely on the prudential requirem ents that apply to BlackR ock's U K-based insurance subsidiary. T he F C A supervises BlackR ock's U K-regulated subsidiaries through a com bination of proactive engagem ent, event-driven and reactive supervision and them atic reviews in order to m onitor BlackR ock's com pliance with regulatory requirem ents. Breaches of the F C A's rules m ay result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against BlackR ock's U K-regulated subsidiaries and/or its em ployees. T he F C A's C onsum er D uty requires BlackR ock's U K authorized firm s to act to deliver good outcom es for retail custom ers taking into account products and services, price and value and consum er understanding and support.\n\nI n addition, BlackR ock has regulated entities in F rance, G erm any, I reland, Jersey, Luxem bourg, the N etherlands and Switzerland.

T he U K G overnm ent and the F C A have also enacted the new O F R  providing a fast-track fram ework for non-U K funds to be recognized and registered for m arketing to retail investors in the U K after Brexit.\n\nThe E U  has seen an increase in C om m on Supervisory Actions by E SM A to coordinate supervisory action by national E U  regulators, m ost notably in areas such as sustainabilityrelated product features and disclosures, product governance, liquidity m anagem ent and fund costs and charges. BlackR ock's E U  operations m ay be affected to the extent this initiative results in form al legislation or action.\n\nEU M em ber States, the U K and m any other non-U S jurisdictions have adopted statutes and/or regulations concerning privacy and data protection and requiring notification of personal data security breaches if certain thresholds are m et.

F ollowing Brexit, the U K onshored the GD P R  into national law ('U K G D P R '), which becam e effective in 2021. In June 2021, the E C  published a new set of standard contractual clauses, which only apply to the transfer of personal data outside of the E U  to a country not approved by the E U  as providing an adequate level of protection for the processing of personal data. T he E U 's adequacy decision with respect to the U K, which allows the continued flow of personal data from  the E U  to the U K, will be regularly reviewed and m ay be revoked if the U K diverges from  its current adequate data protection laws. T he U K has developed its own international data transfer agreem ent, which was im plem ented in M arch 2022.

          "chunk_text": "In 2024, the SEC issued guidance addressing the rules governing liquidity risk management of open-end management investment companies, such as mutual funds, and adopted amendments to the reporting requirements for certain registered investment companies, requiring such investment companies to,  among  other  things,  file  reports  about  their  portfolios  and each of their portfolio holdings on a monthly basis within 30 days of the end of each month (compared to 60 days of the end of the fiscal quarter under  the  previous  rule)  and,  for  open-end  management  investment companies such as mutual funds, to identify and provide certain information about the service providers used to fulfill the rules governing liquidity risk management. Compliance with these amendments is required by November 17, 2025. Timely compliance with these accelerated or new reporting requirements will require us to enhance systems and disclosure controls and procedures.\n\nCertain  of  our  European  subsidiaries,  including  GSBE  in  the  E.U.  and GSAMI  in  the  U.K.,  are  subject  to  MiFID  II  and/or  related  regulations (including the U.K. legislation making such regulations part of U.K. law), which govern the approval, organizational, marketing and reporting requirements of E.U. or U.K.-based investment managers and the ability of investment fund managers located outside the E.U. or the U.K. to access those markets. Goldman Sachs Asset Management BV is subject to similar requirements as a management company licensed under the E.U. Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) Directive  and  the  E.U.  Alternative  Investment  Fund  Managers  (AIFM) Directive  with  additional  authorizations  for  certain  activities  regulated under MiFID II. Our asset management business in the E.U. and the U.K. significantly  depends  on  our  ability  to  delegate  parts  of  our  activities  to other affiliates.\n\nGSAMI is also subject to the prudential regime for U.K. investment firms, the  Investment  Firms  Prudential  Regime,  which  governs  the  prudential requirements for U.K. investment firms prudentially regulated by the FCA.\n\n## Consumer Regulation\n\nOur  U.S.  consumer-oriented  activities  are  subject  to  supervision  and regulation by the CFPB with respect to federal consumer protection laws, including  laws  relating  to  fair  lending  and  the  prohibition  of  unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale or provision  of  consumer  financial  products  and  services.  Our  consumeroriented  activities  are  also  subject  to  various  state  and  local  consumer protection laws, rules and regulations, which, among other things, impose obligations  relating  to  marketing,  origination,  servicing  and  collections activities  in  our  consumer  businesses.  In  addition,  our  U.K.  consumer deposit-taking activities are subject to U.K. consumer protection laws and regulations.\n\n## Compensation Practices\n\nOur compensation practices are subject to oversight by the FRB and, with respect  to  some  of  our  subsidiaries  and  employees,  by  other  regulatory bodies worldwide.\n\nThe FSB has released standards for implementation by local regulators that are  designed  to  encourage  sound  compensation  practices  at  banks  and other financial companies. The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have also  provided  guidance  designed  to  ensure  that  incentive  compensation arrangements  at  banking  organizations  take  into  account  risk  and  are consistent  with  safe  and  sound  practices.  The  guidance  sets  forth  the following  three  key  principles  with  respect  to  incentive  compensation arrangements: (i) the arrangements should provide employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that  does  not  encourage  employees  to  expose  their  organizations  to imprudent risk; (ii) the arrangements should be compatible with effective controls  and  risk  management;  and  (iii)  the  arrangements  should  be supported  by  strong  corporate  governance.  The  guidance  provides  that supervisory  findings with  respect to  incentive  compensation  will  be incorporated,  as  appropriate,  into  the  organization's  supervisory  ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. The guidance also notes that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk  management,  control  or  governance  processes  pose  a  risk  to  the organization's safety and soundness.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires U.S. financial regulators, including the FRB and  SEC,  to  adopt  rules  on  incentive-based  payment  arrangements  at specified  regulated  entities  having  at  least  $1  billion  in  total  assets.  The U.S.  financial  regulators  proposed  revised  rules  in  2016,  which  have  not been finalized. In accordance with an SEC rule, securities exchanges have adopted  rules  mandating,  in  the  case  of  a  restatement,  the  recovery  or 'clawback'  of  excess  incentive-based  compensation  paid  to  current  or former  executive  officers  and  requiring  listed  issuers  to  disclose  any recovery analysis where recovery is triggered by a restatement.\n\nThe NYDFS'  guidance  emphasizes  that  any  incentive  compensation arrangements tied to employee performance indicators at banking institutions  regulated  by  the  NYDFS,  including  GS  Bank  USA,  must  be subject to effective risk management, oversight and control.\n\nIn the E.U., certain provisions in the CRR and CRD are designed to meet the  FSB's  compensation  standards.  These  provisions  limit  the  ratio  of variable  to  fixed  compensation  of  all  employees  at  GSBE  and  of  certain employees at our other operating subsidiaries in the E.U., including those employees  identified  as  having  a  material  impact  on  the  risk  profile  of regulated  entities.  CRR  II  and  CRD  V  amended  certain  aspects  of  these rules,  including,  by  increasing  minimum  variable  compensation  deferral periods.",

      "answer": "The weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for U.S. pension benefits at MetLife in 2024 is 6.00%. This rate is based on anticipated performance of the asset sectors in which the plans invest, weighted by target allocation percentages and informed by long-term historical returns. In contrast, Capital One classifies certain investment securities as high-quality debt instruments, including those issued and guaranteed by the U.S. government and its agencies, which are considered to have no risk of impairment due to credit factors. This conservative investment strategy aligns with risk-averse asset allocation, similar to MetLife\u2019s reliance on high-quality debt instruments to construct a hypothetical portfolio that matches future pension obligations. Both companies incorporate high-quality debt instruments into their financial planning, but MetLife uses them to project returns on pension assets, while Capital One uses them to mitigate credit loss risk in its investment portfolio.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_b - MetLife\u2019s weighted average expected rate of return on U.S. pension plan assets is 6.00% for 2024.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - Capital One identifies high-quality debt instruments, including U.S. government-issued and guaranteed securities, which are considered to have no credit impairment risk.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies rely on high-quality debt instruments, but with different strategic purposes: MetLife uses them to project expected returns on pension assets, while Capital One uses them to manage credit risk in its investment portfolio."

Fair value, also referred to as an exit price, is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value accounting guidance provides a three-level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments. This hierarchy is based on the markets in which the assets or liabilities trade and whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable. The fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Fair value, also referred to as an exit price, is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.

The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Level 1: Level 2:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Valuation is based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

The price of each security is confirmed by comparing such price to other vendor prices before it is finalized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| RMBS and CMBS are generally classified as Level 2 or 3. When significant assumptions are not consistently observable, fair values are derived using the best available data. Such data may include quotes provided by dealers, valuation from external pricing services, independent pricing models, or other model-based valuation techniques, for example, calculation of the present values of future cash flows incorporating assumptions such as benchmark yields, spreads, prepayment speeds, credit ratings and losses. Generally, the external pricing services utilize observable market data to the extent available. Pricing models may be used, which can vary by asset class, and may also incorporate available trade, bid and other market information. Across asset classes, information such as trader/dealer inputs, credit spreads, forward curves and prepayment speeds are used to help determine appropriate valuations. Because many fixed income securities do not trade on a daily basis, the pricing models may apply available information through processes such as benchmarking curves, grouping securities based on their characteristics and using matrix pricing to prepare valuations. In addition, model processes are used by the pricing services to develop prepayment assumptions. | RMBS and CMBS are generally classified as Level 2 or 3.

AXP stated that it is currently assessing the updated guidance and its impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. Similarly, MA is in the process of evaluating when it will adopt this guidance. Both companies will be required to implement new tabular disclosures within a Note to their Consolidated Financial Statements, disaggregating defined expense categories from the expense report lines presented on their Consolidated Statements of Income.

The updated guidance requires enhanced disclosures for significant expenses by reportable operating segment. Significant expense categories and amounts are those regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and included in the measure of a segment's profit or loss. The updated guidance also requires us to disclose the title and position of our CODM, including an explanation of how our CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. We adopted the updated guidance for the annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2024, which did not result in a material impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 24 for related disclosures about our reportable operating segments.\n\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued updated accounting guidance on Disclosures for Income Taxes, effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The updated guidance requires additional disclosure and disaggregated information in the Income Tax Rate reconciliation using both percentages and reporting currency amounts, with additional qualitative explanations of individually significant reconciling items. The updated guidance also requires disclosure of the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by jurisdictional categories (federal (national), state and foreign). We are currently assessing the updated guidance, however it is not expected to have a material impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued updated accounting guidance on the Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and for interim reporting periods beginning December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted.

      "question": "How do the AML/CFT compliance obligations under the EU's 6th Anti-Money Laundering Directive impact the transaction monitoring systems and cross-border data transfer mechanisms of American Express and Mastercard, given their respective reliance on binding corporate rules and standard contractual clauses for EU-U.S. data transfers?",
      "answer": "The AML/CFT compliance obligations under the EU's 6th Anti-Money Laundering Directive significantly shape the transaction monitoring systems and cross-border data transfer mechanisms of both American Express and Mastercard. American Express notes that numerous countries have enacted or proposed enhanced AML/CFT legislation, including the transposition of the 5th and 6th EU Anti-Money Laundering Directives into local laws, which require companies to establish robust AML/CFT programs that include policies for collecting and verifying customer information and monitoring for suspicious transactions. These requirements directly influence how American Express designs and operates its transaction monitoring systems to ensure compliance with the heightened standards under the Directive. Similarly, Mastercard states that it has implemented a comprehensive AML/CFT program, including internal controls and a designated compliance officer, to prevent its network from being used for illicit activity and to address legal requirements stemming from laws like the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and the EU's evolving AML/CFT frameworks. The 6th Directive\u2019s emphasis on stricter monitoring and reporting obligations reinforces the need for both companies to maintain rigorous transaction surveillance systems. Additionally, American Express relies on binding corporate rules and standard contractual clauses as compliant transfer mechanisms to move EU personal data across borders, which are essential for supporting its global AML/CFT compliance operations. These data transfer mechanisms must remain compliant with EU data protection laws, including those influenced by the 6th Directive, to ensure uninterrupted cross-border transaction monitoring and reporting. Therefore, the Directive not only shapes how both companies monitor transactions to meet AML/CFT standards but also dictates the legal frameworks they must follow for cross-border data flows critical to their compliance programs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - American Express is subject to the 6th EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive and relies on binding corporate rules and standard contractual clauses for cross-border data transfers.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Mastercard has implemented a comprehensive AML/CFT program with internal controls and a compliance officer to meet obligations under global AML/CFT laws, including the EU\u2019s evolving frameworks.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies must align their transaction monitoring systems with the 6th Directive\u2019s requirements, while American Express must also ensure its cross-border data transfer mechanisms (e.g., binding corporate rules) support global compliance efforts under the same regulatory framework."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nThe EU and UK General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) impose legal and compliance obligations on companies that process personal data of individuals in the EU and UK, irrespective of the geographical location of the company, with the potential for significant fines for non-compliance (up to 4 percent of total annual worldwide revenue). These laws include, among other things, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches, in certain circumstances, to affected individuals and supervisory authorities and restrictions on the cross-border transfers of EU or UK personal data. We rely on a variety of compliant transfer mechanisms to transfer this personal data, including the use of binding corporate rules and standard contractual clauses. In 2023, the EU and UK regulators approved the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the UK Data Bridge, enabling easier transfers of EU and UK personal data to participating companies in the United States. We are also subject to certain data protection laws in Member States in the EU, which may be more stringent than the EU GDPR. Our data protection programs have become the subject of heightened scrutiny in certain Member States in the EU and we continue to make changes to our privacy practices and data management to comply with these requirements.\n\n## Anti-Money Laundering, Countering the Financing of Terrorism, E conomic Sanctions and Anti-Corruption Compliance\n\nWe are subject to significant supervision and regulation, and an increasingly stringent enforcement environment, with respect to compliance with anti-money laundering (AML), countering the financing of terrorism (CFT), sanctions and anti-corruption laws and regulations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs and policies and procedures for AML/CFT, sanctions and anti-corruption compliance could have material financial, legal and reputational consequences. Additionally, our AML/CFT, sanctions and anti-corruption compliance programs may limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities or affect our relationships with certain partners, service providers and other third parties.\n\nAnti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism\n\nWe are subject to a significant number of AML/CFT laws and regulations globally.\n\nIn the United States, the majority of AML/CFT requirements are derived from the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act and the accompanying regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (collectively referred to as the Bank Secrecy Act), as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. The Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (the AMLA), enacted in January 2021, amended the Bank Secrecy Act and is intended to comprehensively reform and modernize U.S. AML/CFT laws. Many of the statutory provisions in the AMLA will require additional rulemakings, reports and other measures, and the impact of the AMLA will depend on, among other things, rulemaking and implementation guidance.\n\nIn Europe, AML/CFT requirements are largely the result of countries transposing the 5th and 6th EU Anti-Money Laundering Directives (and preceding EU AntiMoney Laundering Directives) into local laws and regulations. Numerous other countries have also enacted or proposed new or enhanced AML/CFT legislation and regulations applicable to American Express.\n\nAmong other things, these laws and regulations generally require us to establish AML/CFT programs that meet certain standards, including policies and procedures to collect information from and verify the identities of our customers, and to monitor for and report suspicious transactions, in addition to other information gathering and recordkeeping requirements. Our AML/CFT programs have become the subject of heightened scrutiny and any errors, failures or delays in complying with AML/CFT laws, deficiencies in our AML/CFT programs or association of our business with money laundering, terrorist financing, tax fraud or other illicit activity can give rise to significant supervisory, criminal and civil proceedings and lawsuits, which could result in significant penalties and forfeiture of assets, loss of licenses or restrictions on business activities, or other enforcement actions.\n\n## Economic Sanctions\n\nNational governments and international bodies, such as the United Nations and the EU, have imposed economic sanctions against individuals, entities, vessels, governments, regions and countries that endanger their interests or violate international norms of behavior. Sanctions have been used to advance a range of foreign policy goals, including conflict resolution, counterterrorism, counternarcotics and promotion of democracy and human rights, among other national and international interests. We maintain a global sanctions compliance program designed to meet the requirements of applicable sanctions regimes. Failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to serious legal and reputational consequences, including criminal penalties.\n\nThe United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions involving targeted jurisdictions, parties or activities. The U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) administers most U.S. sanctions. OFAC regulations prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in financial transactions with or relating to, or other dealings involving, a targeted individual, entity, vessel, government or country without a license or other authorization. OFAC regulations require U.S. persons to block property and property interests of parties on OFAC's Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List and entities owned 50 percent or more by one or more Specially Designated Nationals. Blocked property (e.g., bank deposits or other financial assets) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Regulatory authorities in other international jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom and Member States in the EU, administer similar programs to U.S. sanction programs.",

We  take  measures  to  prevent  transacEons  that  do  not  comply  with  OFAC  and  other  applicable s a ncEons,  including  establishing  a  risk-based  compliance  program  that  has  policies,  procedures  and  controls  designed  to  prevent  us  from  having  unlawful business dealings with prohibited countries, regions, individuals or enEEes.

In the U.S., these obligaEons include requiring the screening of account holders and merchants against  OFAC sancEons lists (including the  SDN  List).

AuthoriEes in the EU are also revising standards relaEng to the authenEcaEon of transacEons, which may increase the number of transacEons that consumers abandon if we are unable to ensure a frictionless authentication experience under the new standards.\n\nRegulaHon of Internet and High-Risk Merchant Categories.

Aspects of our operaEons or business are subject to increasingly complex and fragmented privacy, data, AI and i nformaEon security laws and regulaEons in the U.S., the EU and elsewhere around the world.  For example, in the U.S., we and our customers are respecEvely s ubject to, a mong other laws and regulaEons, Federal Trade Commission and federal banking agency informaEon safeguarding requirements under the GrammLeach-Bliley Act (GLBA) that require, among other things, the maintenance of a wriNen, comprehensive informaEon security program and, increasingly, a number of  s ta te   da ta   a nd  pri va cy  l a ws .

In the EU, we are s ubject to the General Data ProtecEon RegulaEon (the 'GDPR') and its equivalent in the U.K., which requires, among other things, a comprehensive privacy, data protecEon and informaEon security program to protect the personal and sensiEve data of EEA residents.  Several regulators and policymakers around the globe use  the  GDPR  as  a  reference  to  adopt  new  or  updated  privacy,  data  protecEon  and  informaEon  security  laws  and  regulaEons,  although  divergences  have occurred. Laws and regulaEons in this area are constantly evolving due to several factors, including increasing data collecEon and data flows, numerous data breaches and security incidents, more sensiEve data categories, and emerging technologies such as AI (which is now subject to regulaEon in the EU as well as other places).

      "answer": "Both American Express and Mastercard are subject to AML/CFT laws globally, but the way these obligations impact their compliance strategies and business risks differs. American Express notes that increased regulatory scrutiny has led to higher compliance costs, the need to enhance programs, and the risk of enforcement actions if deficiencies are found. They have also voluntarily reported certain transactions to OFAC, including those related to Iran, which could lead to reputational harm and restrictions on business activities. Mastercard, on the other hand, emphasizes a comprehensive AML/CFT program that includes policies, procedures, and internal controls to prevent illicit activity on its network. It also mandates that issuers and acquirers comply with local and international sanctions, including screening against OFAC lists.

New laws or regulations could similarly affect our business, increase the costs and complexity of doing business, impact what we are able to charge for, or offer in connection with, our products and services, impose conflicting obligations, and require us to change certain of our business practices and invest significant management attention and resources, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Political developments can result in legislative and regulatory uncertainty and changes to supervisory and enforcement priorities. In addition, legislators and regulators around the world are aware of each other's approaches to the regulation of the financial services industry. Consequently, a development in one country, state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another.\n\nIf we fail to satisfy regulatory requirements or maintain our financial holding company status, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, and we may be restricted in our ability to take certain capital actions (such as declaring dividends or repurchasing outstanding shares) or engage in certain business activities or acquisitions, which could compromise our competitive position. Additionally, our banking regulators have wide discretion in the examination and the enforcement of applicable banking statutes and regulations and may restrict our ability to engage in certain business activities or acquisitions or require us to maintain more capital. In 2024, we became a Category III firm for purposes of the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies' tailoring framework, resulting in us becoming subject to heightened regulatory expectations and more stringent regulatory requirements. As we continue to grow, these expectations and requirements may further increase, such as if we become a Category II firm, which may increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our business.\n\nLegislators and regulators continue to focus on the operation of card networks, including interchange fees paid to card issuers in payment networks such as Visa and Mastercard, network routing practices and the fees merchants are charged to accept cards. While in some cases our business is subject to exemptions related to certain of these regulations, there is no guarantee that such ex emptions will continue to be available and even where we are not directly regulated, regulation of bankcard fees significantly negatively impacts the discount revenue derived from our business, including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees. In some cases, regulations also extend, or may extend, to certain aspects of our business, such as network and cobrand arrangements, new products or services we may offer, or the terms of card acceptance for merchants, including terms relating to non-discrimination and honor-all-cards. For example, we have exited our network licensing businesses in the EU and Australia as a result of regulation in those jurisdictions. In addition, there is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the EU. See 'Supervision and Regulation - Payments Regulation' under 'Business' for more information. Given differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements, we are subject to regulatory action, penalties and the possibility we will not be able to maintain our existing cobrand and agent relationships in the EU. In addition, a number of federal and state laws to regulate various aspects of network operations are being considered or have passed, including regarding information associated with electronic transactions (such as the use of specific merchant categories codes or limitations on the use of transaction data) and pricing of electronic transactions (such as interchange fees on sales tax  or gratuities).\n\nLegislators and regulators also continue to focus on consumer protection, including product design and pricing constructs, account management and security, credit bureau reporting, disclosure rules, marketing and debt collection practices. This focus has included fees associated with card and banking products, such as a rule issued by the CFPB related to credit card fees for late payments (which is currently stayed); interest rates, such as recent proposals to cap credit card interest rates; rewards programs, such as the recent inquiries by the CFPB and DOT focused on credit card and airline rewards programs; and factors considered by financial institutions in providing services, such as 'fair access' laws. Any new requirements or increased enforcement of existing requirements could materially and adversely impact our revenue growth and profitability, including, as a result of increased scrutiny of our pricing, underwriting and account management practices; the imposition of fines and customer remediation; higher compliance costs; reputational harm; restrictions on our ability to issue cards, appropriately price for the value of our products or work with certain business partners; and changes to our business practices generally.\n\nWe are subject to significant supervision and regulation with respect to compliance with AML/CFT laws, sanctions regimes and anti-corruption laws in numerous jurisdictions. As regulators increase their focus in these areas, new technologies such as digital currencies develop, near real-time money movement solutions are adopted, we introduce new products like checking accounts and geopolitical tensions increase, we face increased costs related to oversight, supervision and potential fines. Our AML/CFT, sanctions and anti-corruption compliance programs have become the subject of heightened scrutiny, and we are working to make enhancements to our existing programs, policies and procedures and to identify and remediate deficiencies. For example, we recently voluntarily reported certain transactions and accounts to OFAC, some of which related to Iran, as described in 'Supervision and Regulation - Anti-Money Laundering, Countering the Financing of Terrorism, Economic Sanctions and Anti-Corruption Compliance' under 'Business.' Errors, failures or delays in complying with AML/CFT, sanctions and anti-corruption laws, deficiencies in our related compliance programs or association of our business with money laundering, terrorist financing, tax fraud or other illicit activities or sanctioned persons, entities, governments or countries can give rise to significant supervisory, criminal and civil proceedings and lawsuits, which could result in significant penalties and forfeiture of assets, loss of licenses or restrictions on business activities, or other enforcement actions, and our reputation may suffer due to our customers' association with certain countries, persons or entities or the existence of any such transactions. Additionally, our AML/CFT, sanctions and anti-corruption compliance programs may limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities or affect our relationships with certain partners, service providers and other third parties.\n\nSee 'Supervision and Regulation' under 'Business' for more information about certain laws and regulations to which we are subject and their impact on us.",

We  have i mplemented a comprehensive  AML/CFT program, comprised of policies,  procedures  and  internal  controls,  including  the  designaEon  of  a  compliance  officer, which is  designed  to  prevent  our  payments  network  from  being  used  to  facilitate  money  laundering  and  other  illicit  acEvity  and  to  address  these  legal  and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks.

AuthoriEes in the EU are also revising standards relaEng to the authenEcaEon of transacEons, which may increase the number of transacEons that consumers abandon if we are unable to ensure a frictionless authentication experience under the new standards.\n\nRegulaHon of Internet and High-Risk Merchant Categories.

Aspects of our operaEons or business are subject to increasingly complex and fragmented privacy, data, AI and i nformaEon security laws and regulaEons in the U.S., the EU and elsewhere around the world.

In the EU, we are s ubject to the General Data ProtecEon RegulaEon (the 'GDPR') and its equivalent in the U.K., which requires, among other things, a comprehensive privacy, data protecEon and informaEon security program to protect the personal and sensiEve data of EEA residents.  Several regulators and policymakers around the globe use  the  GDPR  as  a  reference  to  adopt  new  or  updated  privacy,  data  protecEon  and  informaEon  security  laws  and  regulaEons,  although  divergences  have occurred. Laws and regulaEons in this area are constantly evolving due to several factors, including increasing data collecEon and data flows, numerous data breaches and security incidents, more sensiEve data categories, and emerging technologies such as AI (which is now subject to regulaEon in the EU as well as other places).

      "answer": "American Express and Mastercard both face intense competition from China UnionPay, which is positioned as the third-largest global card network by purchase volume. This influences their strategic focus on differentiated offerings and pricing pressures. American Express emphasizes the importance of features like rewards programs, travel benefits, and partnerships to attract high-spending customers and key business partners, as it competes not only with China UnionPay but also with Visa and Mastercard. Mastercard, on the other hand, faces pricing pressures from China UnionPay and others, which leads it to offer incentives and support to issuers and acquirers to promote its payment products. Both companies must innovate and differentiate their offerings to maintain market position in the face of these competitive dynamics.",

The payments industry continues to undergo dynamic changes in response to evolving technologies, consumer habits and merchant needs.\n\nAs a card issuer, we compete with financial institutions that issue general-purpose credit and debit cards, as well as businesses that issue private label cards, operate mobile wallets, provide payment services or extend credit. We face intense competition in the premium space and for cobrand relationships, as both card issuer and network competitors have targeted high-spending customers and key business partners with attractive value propositions. We also face competition for partners and other differentiated offerings, such as lounge space in U.S. and global hub airports, dining and event reservation and operational capabilities and other experiential offerings to customers. Our banking products also face strong competition, such as with respect to the rates offered on deposits.\n\nOur global card network competes in the global payments industry with other card networks, including, among others, Visa, China UnionPay, Mastercard, JCB, Discover and Diners Club International (which is owned by Discover). We are the fourth largest general-purpose card network globally based on purchase volume, behind Visa, China UnionPay and Mastercard. In addition to such networks, we compete against a range of companies globally, including merchant acquirers, processors and web- and mobile-based payment platforms (e.g., Alipay, PayPal and Shop Pay), as well as regional payment networks (such as the National Payments Corporation of India).\n\nThe principal competitive factors that affect card-issuing, merchant and network businesses include:\n\n- The features, value and quality of the products and services, including customer care, rewards programs and offers, partnerships, travel and lifestylerelated benefits (including lounges, dining and other entertainment), banking services and digital and mobile services, as well as the costs associated with providing such features and services\n- Reputation and brand recognition\n- The number, spending characteristics and credit performance of customers\n- The quantity, diversity and quality of the establishments where the cards can be used\n- The attractiveness of the value proposition to card issuers, merchant acquirers, third-party processors, cardholders, corporate clients, merchants and other payment intermediaries (including the relative cost and ease of using or accepting the products and services, and capabilities such as fraud prevention and data analytics)\n- The number, quality and cost of other cards and other forms of payment and financing available to customers, as well as the integration and connectivity of those products\n- The security of cardholder, merchant and network partner information\n- The success of marketing and promotional campaigns\n- The speed of innovation and investment in systems, technologies and product and service offerings\n- The nature and quality of expense management tools, electronic payment methods and data capture and reporting capabilities, particularly for business customers\n\nAnother aspect of competition is the dynamic and rapid growth of alternative payment and financing mechanisms, systems and products, which include payment facilitators and aggregators, digital payment, open banking and electronic wallet platforms, point-of-sale lenders and buy now, pay later products, real-time settlement and processing systems, financial technology companies, digital currencies developed by both central banks and the private sector, blockchain and similar distributed ledger technologies, prepaid systems and gift cards, and systems linked to customer accounts or that provide payment solutions. The integration of new or evolving technologies, such as generative artificial intelligence, has the potential to create new or better competitor products, alter the competitive environment and disintermediate our relationship with customers. Additionally, various competitors are integrating more financial services into their product offerings and competitors are seeking to attain the benefits of an integrated payments platform, such as ours.",

We compete in all categories of payments (including paper-based payments and all forms of electronic payments) as well as in all categories in which we provide services and solutions:\n\n- General Purpose Payments Networks. We compete worldwide with payments networks such as Visa, American Express, JCB, China UnionPay and Discover, among others . These  compeEtors  tend  to  offer  a  range  of  card-based  payment  products.  Some  compeEtors  have  more  market  share  than  we  do  in  certain juri s di cEons .

We conEnue to face intense compeEEve pressure on the prices we charge our issuers and acquirers, and we seek to enter into business agreements with them through which we offer incentives and other support to issue and promote our payment products.\n- Debit and Local Networks. We compete with ATM and point-of-sale debit networks. In various countries, local debit brands serve as the main domesEc brands, while  our  brands  are  used  mostly  to  enable  cross-border  transacEons  (typically  represenEng  a  small  porEon  of  overall  transacEon  volume).

We  face  compeEEon  in  the  ACH  and  real-Eme  account-based  payments  space  from  providers  of  infrastructure, applicaEons  and  services. As  these  real-Eme  account-based  proposiEons  mature,  we  face  a  possible  increase  in  compeEEon  for  our  exisEng  domesEc person-to-merchant ('P2M') and person-to-person ('P2P') transacEon market share. Similarly, as interlinking of these infrastructures is further explored, they could  disrupt  our  exisEng  cross-border  P2M  and  P2P  market  share. Also,  several  industry  iniEaEves  are  experimenEng  with  the  concept  of  account-based global schemes, which could lead to a disruption of the clearing and settlement options utilized in various currencies.\n- Digital  Wallets and other  Fintechs. As the global payments industry becomes more complex, we face increasing compeEEon from fintechs and other emerging payments providers, both for customers and data. Many of these providers have developed payments systems focused on online acEvity in e-commerce and mobile  channels  (in  some  cases,  expanding  to  other  channels),  and  may  process  payments  using  in-house  account  transfers,  real-Eme  account-based payments  networks  or  global  or  local  networks,  in  addiEon  to  card.  Examples  include  digital  wallet  providers,  point-of-sale  financing/buy-now-pay-later providers,  mobile  operator  services,  mobile  phone-based  money  transfer  and  microfinancing  services,  device  manufacturers,  B2B  accounts  payable  and accounts receivable providers.\n- Digital Public Infrastructure and Other Government-Backed SoluGLYPH&lt;c=27,font=/QPPBAA+CalibriBoldItalic&gt;ons. Governments have been focused on creaEng and expanding local digital payments structures. Increasingly,  these  structures  include  digital  public  infrastructure  (DPI),  which  is  owned  by  governments  and  oVen  supported  by  third  parEes,  and  aim  to provide payments services as a public good.

      "answer": "American Express faces significant risks related to its investments in open banking and other emerging technologies, including the possibility that the adoption of these technologies could increase operational complexity, expose the company to new risks, and require substantial expenditures without guaranteed returns. These risks are compounded by the competitive landscape, where larger or more agile competitors may outpace American Express in developing and deploying such technologies. In contrast, Mastercard actively integrates open banking into its broader services portfolio, positioning it as a key differentiator that enhances its payment capabilities and drives market wins. Mastercard\u2019s strategic emphasis on combining open banking with other services supports its goal of accelerating financial performance and expanding its transaction volume. Therefore, while American Express views open banking as a competitive risk requiring significant investment, Mastercard treats it as a strategic asset that enhances its value proposition and revenue generation.",

These risks to our brand and reputation, as well as other risks described in this Risk Factors section, are heightened by the increasing sophistication and availability of artificial intelligence technology, including by assisting with the creation of deepfakes and increasing the velocity of distribution of disinformation. Although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand, negative perceptions or publicity could materially and adversely affect our business volumes, revenues and profitability.\n\nWe face increased scrutiny from stakeholders who have diverging views related to business practices and company activities, which could result in reputational harm, litigation, enforcement actions and other adverse consequences. In addition, we are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and legal risks related to environmental, social and governance topics, such as those arising from new disclosure requirements in certain jurisdictions. Inaccurate perceptions or mischaracterizations of disclosures on these topics, or our goals and initiatives, while outside of our control, could impact our reputation, colleague hiring and retention and public perceptions of our business.\n\n## If we are not able to successfully invest in, and compete with respect to, technological developments and new products and services across all our businesses, our revenue and profitability could be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes.

Incorporating new technologies into our products and services, including developing the appropriate governance and controls consistent with regulatory expectations, requires substantial expenditures and takes considerable time, and may have unintended consequences or ultimately be unsuccessful. We expect that new technologies in the payments industry will continue to emerge, and these new technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, our ex isting technology.\n\nThe process of developing new products and services, enhancing existing products and services and adapting to technological changes and evolving industry standards is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly impede our ability to compete effectively. Our competitors may develop products, platforms or technologies that become more widely adopted by consumers, merchants or service providers than ours, including as a result of increased involvement by technology companies in the payments industry and our competitors' greater scale or ability to pursue and adopt new technologies. In addition, we may underestimate the resources needed and overestimate our ability to develop new products and services, particularly beyond our traditional card products and travel-related services.\n\nThe use of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, including generative artificial intelligence, has increased rapidly with the increasing sophistication and applications of the technology. Our and our partners' use of artificial intelligence and machine learning is subject to various risks including flaws in models or datasets that may result in biased or inaccurate results, unintended or unexpected outcomes, ethical considerations regarding artificial intelligence, infringement of intellectual property rights, ex posure of proprietary or personal information, heightened security risks and the ability to safely deploy and implement governance and controls for artificial intelligence systems. The complex ity of these technologies can make it difficult to assess proper operation, reduce error, or understand and explain their outputs. Adverse consequences of artificial intelligence and machine learning remain uncertain but could include flaws in the decisions, predictions, outputs or analysis such technologies produce and subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, heightened regulatory scrutiny and brand or reputational harm.\n\nOur ability to adopt new technologies may be inhibited by the emergence of industry-wide standards, a changing legislative and regulatory environment, an inability to develop appropriate governance and controls, a lack of internal product and engineering expertise, resistance to change from Card Members, merchants or service providers, lack of appropriate change management processes or the complexity of our systems. In addition, our adoption of new technologies and our introduction of new products and services may increase operational complexity and risk, and expose us to new or enhanced risks, particularly in areas where we have less experience or our existing governance and control systems may be insufficient, which could require us to make substantial expenditures or subject us to legal liability, heightened regulatory scrutiny and brand or reputational harm.\n\n## We may not be successful in realizing the benefits associated with our acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and investment activity, and our business and reputation could be materially adversely affected.\n\nWe have acquired a number of businesses and have made a number of strategic investments, and continue to evaluate potential transactions. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, value potential investment or acquisition opportunities accurately, negotiate acceptable terms for those opportunities, or complete proposed acquisitions and investments. The process of integrating an acquired company, business or technology could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, including in integrating systems and personnel or further developing the acquired business or technology, result in unanticipated liabilities, including legal claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes and information security vulnerabilities or breaches (including from not integrating the acquired company, business or technology quickly or appropriately, from activities that occurred prior to the acquisition, from inadequate systems or controls of the acquired company, and from exposure to third party relationships of the acquired company or business or new laws and regulations), and harm our business generally. Expanding to new businesses, geographies or customer types through acquisitions may subject us to new risks and we may not have the relevant expertise or business structure to achieve the desired results. It may take us longer than ex pected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions, and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could materially adversely affect our business and operating results, including as a result of write-downs of goodwill and other intangible assets.",

We  focus  on  enabling  consumer  payments,  providing  consumers  with  choice  and  flexibility  to  transact  across  mulEple  payment  rails (i ncl udi ng ca rds , rea l -ti me pa yments  a nd a ccount-ba s ed tra ns a ctions ), while ens uring tha t a ll pa yments  a re s a fe, s ecure a nd s ea mles s . We do s o by:\n\n- Capturing the significant secular opportunity of ca s h dis pla cement by increasing acceptance through advancing technology and partnering with players across the payments ecosystem, as well as by opening up closed-loop and domesEc networks. We also pursue incremental volume and transacEons by extending our reach across under-penetrated card verticals (such as bill pay) and real-time account-based payments\n- Driving  brand  preference  through  compelling  consumer  experiences by  offering  relevant  value  proposiEons  to  consumers  (including  features,  benefits  and experiences),  providing  comprehensive  digital  funcEonality  (such  as  Digital  First),  delivering  enhanced  security  and  funcEonality  (increasing  tokenizaEon, s ca l i ng a uthe nti ca ti on a nd s tre a ml i ni ng onl i ne  che ckout) a nd dri vi ng i ncrea s ed a pprova l , s pend a nd a ctiva ti on ra tes\n- InvesGLYPH&lt;c=27,font=/QPPBAA+CalibriBoldItalic&gt; ng  in the future and driving market transformaGLYPH&lt;c=27,font=/QPPBAA+CalibriBoldItalic&gt;on by extending the reach of our network to enable the tokenizaEon of credenEals, idenEEes, assets and data  and  the  exchange  of  those  items  between  counterparEes  (providing  security,  privacy  and  control).  We  also  seek  to  achieve  this  transformaEon  by modernizing our card switch to meet evolving needs\n\nCommercial  and  new  payment  flows. We  focus  on  capturing  opportuniEes  in  commercial  payments  (both  point-of-sale  purchases  and  invoiced  payments)  and disbursements  and  remiNances  (specifically,  through  Mastercard  Move,  our  collecEon  of  money  movement  capabiliEes  that  provides  soluEons  for  money tra ns fers  to cons umers from consumers, businesses or governments).

Our services and other soluEons, which are interdependent with our payment network, drive value for our customers and the broader payments ecosystem. We offer security soluEons, consumer acquisiEon and engagement, business and market insights, gateway, processing and open banking, among  other  services  and  soluEons  (including  ACH  batch  and  real-Eme  account-based  payments  and  soluEons).   As  we  drive  value,  our  services  and  other s ol uti ons  genera te revenue while helping to accelerate our overall financial performance. We do so by:\n\n- Differentiating our payments capabilities by combining our wide range of services and soluEons in various ways to meet the needs and prioriEes of our  partners, which helps drive market wins and payments growth\n- Enhancing and expanding our suite of services to beNer serve our exisEng customers, including across new buying centers and new capability areas, as well as to reach new customers\n- Scaling distribuGLYPH&lt;c=27,font=/QPPBAA+CalibriBoldItalic&gt;on by  us i ng  our  te chnol ogy  pl a Sorms   to  ena ble  us   to  s wi tch  more  tra ns a cEons   a nd  deliver  more  s ervices   per  tra ns a cEon,  s elling  directly  to customers  through  a  dedicated  sales  force  and  global  account  teams,  and  embedding  services  with  partners  (such  as  tech  plaSorms,  system  integrators, processors and other networks) to deliver those services at scale",

This results in a difference of $13.1 billion, with Citibank holding significantly higher liquidity commitments in asset-backed structures compared to Bank of America.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Bank of America's liquidity commitments to unconsolidated municipal bond trusts totaled $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2024.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Citibank had liquidity commitments of $14.9 billion to consolidated asset-backed commercial paper conduits as of December 31, 2024.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the difference between the two commitments: $14.9 billion (Citibank) - $1.8 billion (Bank of America) = $13.1 billion.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The comparison reveals that Citibank has a significantly higher liquidity exposure to asset-backed structures than Bank of America as of the reporting date."

The  loans  are  sold  on  a  non-recourse  basis  to consolidated trusts. The securitizations are ongoing, whereas additional receivables will be funded into the trusts by either loan repayments or proceeds from securities issued to third parties, depending on the securitization structure. The Corporation's continuing  involvement  with  the  securitization  trusts  includes  servicing  the receivables  and  holding  various  subordinated  interests,  including  an  undivided seller's interest in th e cred it card  receivab les and  owning certain retained  interests.\n\nAt December 3 1, 202 4 and 2023, the carrying values of the receivables in the trusts  totaled  $18.1  billion  and  $16.6  billion,  wh ich   are  includ ed   in  loans  and leases, and the carrying values of senior debt securities that were issued to thirdparty  investors  from  the  trusts  totaled  $ 8.0  billion  and   $7.8  b illion,  wh ich   are included in long-term debt.\n\n## Resecuritization Trusts\n\nThe  Corporation  transfers  securities,  typically  MBS,  into  resecuritization  VIEs generally at the request of customers seeking securities with specific characteristics. Generally , there are no significant ongoing activities performed in a resecuritization trust, and no single investor has the unilateral ability to liquidate the trust.\n\nThe Corporation resecuritized $23.9 billion, $8.6  billion,  and  $21.8  billion  of securities during 202 4, 2023 and 2022, respectively . Securities transferred into resecuritization  VIEs  were  measured  at  fair  value  with  changes  in  fair  value recorded in market making  and  similar activities prior to the resecuritization and, accordingly ,  no  gain  or  loss  on  sale  was  record ed .  Securities  received   from  th e resecuritization VIEs were recognized at their fair value of $3.6 billion, $2.4 billion and $2.4 billion during 202 4, 2023 and 2022, respectively . In 202 4, 2023 and 2022, substantially all of the securities were classified as trading account assets. Substantially  all  of  the  trading  account  securities  carried  at  fair  value  were categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## Customer VIEs\n\nCustomer VIEs include credit-linked, equity-linked and commodity-linked note VIEs, repackaging VIEs and asset acquisition VIEs, which are typically created on behalf of customers who wish to obtain market or credit exposure to a specific company, index, commodity or financial instrument.\n\nThe  Corporation's  involvement  in  the  VIE  is  limited  to  its  loss  exposure.  Th e Corporation's maximum  loss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated customer VIEs totaled $1.1 billion and $952 million at December 3 1, 202 4 and 2023, including the notional amount of derivatives to which the Corporation is a counterparty, net of losses previously recorded, and the Corporation's investment, if any, in securities issued by the VIEs.\n\n## Municipal Bond Trusts\n\nThe Corporation administers municipal bond trusts that hold highly-rated, long-term, fixed-rate municipal bonds. The trusts obtain financing by issuing floating-rate trust certificates  that  reprice  on  a  weekly  or  other  short-term  basis  to  third-party investors.\n\nThe  Corporation's  liquidity  commitments  to  unconsolidated  municipal  bond trusts, including those for which the Corporation was transferor, totaled $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

This analysis is subject to certain estimates, estimation methodologies, judgments and uncertainties. Uncertainties include potential ratings limitations that certain entities may have with respect to permissible counterparties, as well as general subjective counterparty behavior. For example, certain corporate customers and markets counterparties could re-evaluate their business relationships with Citi and limit transactions in certain contracts or market instruments with Citi. Changes in counterparty behavior could impact Citi's funding and liquidity, as well as the results of operations of certain of its businesses. The actual impact to Citigroup or Citibank is unpredictable and may differ materially from the potential funding and liquidity impacts described below. For additional information on the impact of credit rating changes on Citi and its applicable subsidiaries, see 'Risk Factors-Liquidity Risks' above.\n\n## Citigroup Inc. and Citibank-Potential Derivative Triggers\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, Citi estimates that a hypothetical one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating across all three major rating agencies could impact funding and liquidity due to derivative triggers by approximately $0.1 billion, unchanged from September 30, 2024, for Citigroup Inc., and $0.1 billion, unchanged from September 30, 2024, for Citibank. Other funding sources, such as secured financing transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely affected.\n\nIn total, as of December 31, 2024, Citi estimates that a one-notch downgrade of Citigroup Inc. and Citibank across all three major rating agencies could result in increased aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately $0.2 billion, compared to $0.2 billion as of September 30, 2024. As detailed under 'High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA)' above, Citigroup has various liquidity resources available to its bank and non-bank entities in part as a contingency for the potential events described above.\n\nIn addition, a broad range of mitigating actions are currently included in Citigroup's and Citibank's contingency funding plans. For Citigroup, these mitigating factors include, but are not limited to, accessing surplus funding capacity from existing clients, tailoring levels of secured lending and adjusting the size of select trading books and collateralized borrowings at certain Citibank subsidiaries. Mitigating actions available to Citibank include, but are not limited to, selling or financing highly liquid government securities, tailoring levels of secured lending, adjusting the size of select trading assets, reducing loan originations and renewals, raising additional deposits or borrowing from the FHLB or central banks. Citi believes these mitigating actions could substantially reduce the funding and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades described above.\n\n## Citibank-Additional Potential Impacts\n\nIn addition to the above derivative triggers, Citi believes that a potential downgrade of Citibank's senior debt/long-term rating across any of the three major rating agencies could also have an adverse impact on the commercial paper/short-term rating of Citibank. Citibank has provided liquidity commitments to consolidated asset-backed commercial paper conduits, primarily in the form of asset purchase agreements. As of December 31, 2024, Citibank had liquidity commitments of approximately $14.9 billion to consolidated asset-backed commercial paper conduits (compared to $11.0 billion at December 31, 2023) (see Note 23).",

      "question": "How does the inclusion of a 'downside scenario' in both Bank of America's and Citigroup's allowance for credit loss calculations reflect their differing macroeconomic assumptions and impact their provisioning strategies for loan losses in 2024?",
      "answer": "Bank of America incorporates a 'downside scenario' that assumes continued inflation and interest rates above baseline levels, which increases uncertainty and affects the allowance for credit losses. This contrasts with Citigroup\u2019s use of a downside scenario as part of a three-scenario framework (base, upside, downside), where the downside scenario informs the quantitative component of the ACL, particularly over an eight-quarter reasonable and supportable forecast period. Both institutions use these downside assumptions to shape their provisioning strategies, but BAC emphasizes interrelated macroeconomic variables like GDP and unemployment, while Citi focuses on forward-looking forecasts and qualitative adjustments to address risks not captured quantitatively.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - BAC includes a downside scenario reflecting continued inflation and interest rates above baseline, which influences the allowance for credit losses based on macroeconomic variables like GDP growth (2.4%) and unemployment rate (4.2%) as of December 31, 2024.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Citi uses a downside scenario as part of a three-scenario model (base, upside, downside) over an eight-quarter R&S period, with the ACLL to EOP loans at 6.4% for Branded Cards and 11.3% for Retail Services as of December 31, 2024.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies use a downside macroeconomic scenario in their allowance for credit loss modeling, but BAC emphasizes GDP and unemployment dynamics, while Citi integrates these into a broader ACL framework with both quantitative and qualitative components."

Our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is discussed in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 5 - Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to th e Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe  determination  of  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  is  based  on  numerous estimates and assumptions, which require a high degree of judgment and are often interrelated.  A  critical  jud gment  in  th e  p rocess  is  th e  weigh ting  of  our  forward looking  macroeconomic  scenarios  that  are  incorporated  into  our  quantitative models. As any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain, the Corporation uses multiple macroeconomic scenarios in its expected credit losses (ECL) calculation, which  have  included  a  baseline  scenario  derived  from  consensus  estimates,  an adverse scenario reflecting a moderate recession, a downside scenario reflecting continued  inflation  and  interest  rates  above  the  baseline  scenario,  a  tail  risk scenario  similar  to  th e  severely  ad verse  scenario  used   in  stress  testing  and   an upside scenario that considers the potential for improvement above the baseline scenario.  The  overall  economic  outlook  is  weighted  to  reflect  a  moderate  growth environment, with lower gross domestic product (GDP)  growth and higher unemployment rate expectations  as  compared  to  what  we  experienced  in  202 4. Generally ,  as  th e  consensus  estimates  improve  or  deteriorate,  th e  allowance  for credit losses will change in a similar direction.\n\nThere are multiple variables that drive the macroeconomic scenarios with the key variables including, but not limited to, U.S. real GDP and unemployment rates. As of December 31, 2024, the latest consensus estimate for the U.S.  average unemployment rate for the fourth quarter of 202 4 was 4.2 percent, and U.S. real GDP was  forecasted  to  grow  2.4  percent  year-over-year  in  the  fourth  quarter  of 2024,  reflecting  a  strong  labor  market  and  steady  growth  compared  to  our macroeconomic  outlook  as  of  December  3 1,  2023,  and  were  factored  into  our allowance for credit losses estimate as of December 31, 2024. In addition, the table below presents the weighted macroeconomic outlook for U.S. average unemployment rate and U.S. real GDP.\n\n## Table 45 Key Allowance Variables\n\n",

Changes in the ACL are reflected as Provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income for each reporting period.

      "question": "How does the impact of data localization regulations on American Express's international growth strategy compare to Bank of America's exposure to similar regulatory constraints, based on their respective 2024 10-K filings?",
      "answer": "American Express highlights that data localization regulations could hinder its international growth by limiting its ability to replicate its business model abroad and face challenges in acquiring new card members and merchants. Bank of America, on the other hand, is subject to evolving legal and regulatory expectations around data localization, which could lead to reputational, legal, and operational risks if their data practices are inconsistent with jurisdictional requirements. Both firms face regulatory constraints, but American Express's business model is more directly impacted in terms of international expansion, while Bank of America's exposure centers on compliance and reputational risks.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From AXP 2024 10-K, data localization is explicitly mentioned as a potential barrier to international growth, affecting the company's ability to replicate its business model and acquire new international customers.",
        "Step 2: From BAC 2024 10-K, data localization is part of a broader set of evolving legal and regulatory requirements (LRRs) that include risks related to inconsistent application of privacy and data protection laws across jurisdictions.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are impacted by data localization, but in different ways: AXP faces operational and market-entry challenges in international growth, while BAC faces compliance and reputational risks due to inconsistent regulatory expectations across jurisdictions."

          "chunk_text": "## Changes in accounting standards or assum ptions in applying accounting policies could adversely affect us.\n\nAccounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported value of our assets or  liabilities  and   results  of  operations  and  are  critical  because  they  require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that  are  inherently  uncertain.  If  assumptions,  estimates  or  judgments  are erroneously  applied,  we  could  be  required  to  correct  and  restate  prior-period financial  statements.  Accounting  standard-setters  and  those  who  interpret  the accounting standards, including the SEC, banking regulators and our independent registered public accounting firm may also amend or even reverse their previous interpretations  or  positions  on  how  various  standards  should  be  applied.  These changes may be difficult to predict and could impact the preparation and reporting of our financial statements, including the application of new or revised standards retrospectively ,  resulting  in  unexpected  losses,  revisions  to  prior-period   financial statements and other adverse impacts to us, including legal and regulatory risk.\n\n## We may be adversely affected by changes in U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws and regulations.\n\nWe  could  be  adversely  affected  if  U.S.  and  foreign  governmental  authorities further change tax laws, including changes to the T ax Cuts and Jobs Act of 20 1 7 and  Inflation Reduction  Act of 2022.  Also, new  guidelines issued by  the Organization  for  Economic  Cooperation  and  Development  (OECD),  which  are currently being enacted into law in some OECD countries in which we operate, are expected to impose a 15 percent global minimum tax on a country-by-country basis. Any implementation of and/or change in U.S. and foreign tax laws and regulations or  interpretations  of  current  or  future  tax  laws  and   regulations  could   materially adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax liabilities and results of operations. U.S. and foreign tax laws are complex and our judgments, interpretations or applications of such tax laws could differ from that of the relevant governmental authority . This could  result  in  additional  tax  liab ilities  and   interest,  p enalties,  th e  red uction  of certain  tax  benefits  and/or  the  requirement  to  make  adjustments  to  amounts recorded, which could be material.\n\nAlso, we have U.K. net deferred tax assets (DT A) which consist primarily of net operating  losses  that  are  expected  to  be  realized  in  a  U.K.  subsidiary  over  an extended number of years. Adverse developments with respect to tax laws or to other material factors, such as prolonged worsening of international capital markets or changes in the ability of our U.K. subsidiary to conduct business in the markets outside the U.K., could lead our management to reassess and/or change its current conclusion that no valuation allowance is necessary with respect to our U.K. net DTA.\n\n## Reputation\n\n## Damage  to  our  reputation  could  harm   our  businesses,  including  our competitive position and business prospects.\n\nOur ability to attract and retain clients, investors and employees is impacted by our reputation. Harm to our reputation can arise from various sources, including actual or perceived activities of our officers, directors, employees, other representatives, clients and third parties, including counterparties, such as fraud, misconduct and unethical behavior, adequacy of our ability to detect, prevent and/or respond  to  fraud  perpetrated  against  our  clients,  and  the  handling  of  related disputes regarding the use of our products and services, including electronic payments, effectiveness of our internal controls, the fees charged to our clients, including overdraft and non-sufficient funds fees, compensation practices, lending practices, suitability or reasonableness of particular trading or investment strategies, the services offered to our clients, the reliability  of  our  research   and   mod els  and   p roh ib iting  clients  from  engaging  in certain transactions.\n\nOur reputation may also be harmed by actual or perceived failure to deliver the products,  standards  of  service  and  quality  expected  by  our  clients  and  the community,  including  the  overstatement  or  mislabeling  of  the  environmental benefits of our products, services or transactions, the failure to protect our clients and/or recognize and address client complaints, compliance failures, technology changes,  the  implementation,  management  and  use  of  emerging  technologies, including  AI,  th e  failure  to  maintain  effective  d ata  management,  cybersecurity incidents and information and security breaches affecting us and our employees, clients and third parties, which have occurred and which we expect to continue to occur with increased frequency and severity , prolonged or repeated system outages, our privacy policies, the unintended disclosure of or failure to safeguard personal, proprietary  or  confidential  information,  the  breach  of  our  fiduciary  obligations, employment  practices  and  the  handling  of  widespread  health  emergencies  or pandemics.  Our  reputation  may  also  be  harmed  by  litigation  and/or  regulatory matters and their outcomes, and/or criticism or challenges by third parties, relating to  the  topics  discussed  above  or  otherwise.  Challenges  and  criticisms  to  our environmental and social practices and disclosures, and those of our clients and third parties, including from third parties, who may have diverging views regarding those practices and disclosures, may also harm our reputation.\n\nIncreases in market interest rates have resulted in increased focus on asset and liability management, including HTM and AFS securities and related unrealized losses. Perceptions of our liquidity and financial condition, actions by the financial services industry generally, or by certain members or individuals in the industry may harm  our  reputation.  Adverse  publicity  or  negative  information  posted  on  social media by employees, the media or otherwise, whether or not factually correct, may trigger  a  loss  of  trust  or  confidence  on  the  part  of  clients,  counterparties, shareholders,  investors,  debt  holders,  market  analysts,  other  relevant  parties  or regulators, adversely impacting our business prospects and results of operations.\n\nWe are  subject  to  complex  and  evolving  LRRs  and  interpretations,  including regarding  fair  lending  activity ,  UDAAP ,  electronic  funds  transfers,  know-yourcustomer requirements, data protection and privacy (including the GDPR and the CCPA), cross-border data movement and data localization, cybersecurity , the use and development of AI, data and technology and other matters, as well as evolving and expansive interpretations of these LRRs. Principles concerning the appropriate scope of consumer and commercial privacy vary considerably across jurisdictions, and  regulatory  and  public  expectations  regarding  the  definition  and  scope  of consumer and commercial privacy and data protection remains fluid. These laws may  be  interpreted  and  applied  by  various  jurisdictions  inconsistent  with  our current  or  future  practices,  or  with  one  another.  If  personal,  confidential  or proprietary information of clients in our possession, or in the possession of third parties or financial data aggregators, is mishandled, misused or mismanaged, or if we do not timely or adequately address such information, we may face regulatory , legal and operational risks, which could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.",

      "question": "How do the supervisory ratings impact American Express's ability to make acquisitions, given their deficiencies in incentive compensation arrangements, and how does this regulatory risk compare to Bank of America's eligibility requirements for maintaining its financial holding company status?",
      "answer": "American Express's deficiencies in incentive compensation arrangements, if identified by banking regulators, may be incorporated into their supervisory ratings, which can directly restrict their ability to make acquisitions or perform other strategic actions. Enforcement actions could also be taken if these deficiencies are not promptly corrected. Similarly, Bank of America's status as a financial holding company is conditional on maintaining satisfactory supervisory ratings and minimum capital ratios, and failure to meet these could result in limitations on its activities, including potential acquisitions. Therefore, both firms are subject to regulatory constraints tied to supervisory ratings that directly affect their strategic growth capabilities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - American Express's incentive compensation arrangements are subject to regulatory review, and deficiencies may be incorporated into supervisory ratings, affecting their ability to make acquisitions.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Bank of America's eligibility as a financial holding company depends on maintaining satisfactory supervisory ratings and minimum capital ratios, with failure potentially resulting in activity limitations including on acquisitions.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both American Express and Bank of America are subject to regulatory constraints tied to supervisory ratings that influence their ability to pursue acquisitions, though the specific regulatory frameworks and entities involved differ."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nPursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, which added Section 13(r) to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), an issuer is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with individuals or entities designated pursuant to certain Ex ecutive Orders. Disclosure is generally required even where the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted outside the United States by non-U.S. affiliates in compliance with applicable law and whether or not the activities are sanctionable under U.S. law.\n\nIn 2024, we became aware that a third-party automated teller machine (ATM) network provider maintained a relationship with an Iranian bank identified on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons list. As a result, American Express Card Members had the ability to access ATMs located outside of Iran that were operated by the Iranian bank through our ATM authorization program. We have identified approximately 37 such ATM transactions by Card Members. We had negligible gross revenues and net profits attributable to these transactions. We immediately suspended our relationship with the ATM network provider and do not intend to continue to engage in this activity.\n\nIn 2024, we also identified approximately 30 consumer accounts of individuals that may be, or may have been, employed by the Government of Iran. We believe the accounts were used only for personal expenses. We had negligible gross revenues and net profits attributable to these accounts. All of the accounts are closed and we do not intend to continue to engage in this activity.\n\nWe voluntarily reported the above transactions and accounts to OFAC.\n\n## Anti-Corruption\n\nWe are subject to complex anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA), the UK Bribery Act and other laws that prohibit the making or offering of improper payments. The FCPA makes it illegal to corruptly offer or provide anything of value to foreign government officials, political parties or political party officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or an improper advantage. The FCPA also requires us to strictly comply with certain accounting and internal controls standards. The UK Bribery Act also prohibits commercial bribery and the receipt of a bribe, and makes it a corporate offense to fail to prevent bribery by an associated person, in addition to prohibiting improper payments to foreign government officials. Failure by us or our colleagues, contractors or agents to comply with the FCPA, the UK Bribery Act and other similar laws can expose us and/or individual colleagues to investigation, prosecution and potentially severe criminal and civil penalties.\n\n## Compensation Practices\n\nOur compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. The federal banking regulators' guidance on sound incentive compensation practices sets forth three key principles for incentive compensation arrangements that are designed to help ensure that incentive compensation plans do not encourage imprudent risk-taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of banking organizations. The three principles provide that a banking organization's incentive compensation arrangements should (1) provide incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risks, (2) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and (3) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization's board of directors. Any deficiencies in our compensation practices that are identified by the banking regulators in connection with their review of our compensation practices may be incorporated into our supervisory ratings, which can affect our ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against us if our incentive compensation arrangements or related risk-management control or governance processes are determined to pose a risk to our safety and soundness, and we have not taken prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires U.S. financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to adopt rules on incentivebased payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets. In 2016, the federal banking regulators, the SEC, the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the National Credit Union Administration proposed revised rules on incentive-based compensation practices, which were reproposed by certain of those agencies in 2024, but have not yet been finalized. If these or other regulations are adopted in a form similar to what has been proposed, they will impose limitations on the manner in which we may structure compensation for our colleagues, which could adversely affect our ability to hire, retain and motivate key colleagues.",

          "chunk_text": "We  are  subject  to  an  extensive  regulatory  framework  applicable  to  BHCs, financial holding companies and banks and other financial services entities. U.S. federal  regulation  of  banks,  BHCs  and  financial  holding  companies  is  intended primarily  for  th e  p rotection  of  d ep ositors  a nd   th e  Dep osit  Insura nce  F und   (DIF) rather than for the protection of shareholders and creditors. As a registered financial holding company and BHC, the Corporation is subject to the supervision of, and regular  inspection  by ,  th e  Board  of  Governors  of  th e  Federal  R eserve  System (Federal  Reserve).  Our  U.S.  bank  subsidiaries  (the  Banks),  organized  as  national banking associations, are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Office  of  th e  Comptroller  of  th e  Currency  (OCC),  th e  Fed eral  Deposit  Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Federal Reserve. In addition, the Federal Reserve and the OCC have  adopted  guidelines  that  establish  minimum  standards  for  the  design, implementation and board oversight of BHCs' and national banks' risk governance frameworks.  U.S.  financial  holding  companies,  and  the  companies  under  their control, are permitted to engage in activities considered 'financial in nature' as defined by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and related Federal Reserve interpretations. The  Corporation's  status  as  a  financial  holding  company  is  conditioned  upon maintaining certain  eligibility  requirements  for  both  the  Corporation  and  its  U.S. depository institution subsidiaries, including minimum capital ratios, supervisory ratings  and,  in  the  case  of  the  depository  institutions,  at  least  satisfactory Community Reinvestment  Act  ratings.  Failure  to  be  an  eligible  financial  holding company could result in the Federal Reserve limiting Bank of America's activities, including  potential  acquisitions.  Additionally ,  we  are  subject  to  a  significant number of laws, rules and regulations (LRRs) that govern our businesses in the U.S. and in the other jurisdictions in which we operate, including permissible activities, minimum levels of capital and liquidity , compliance risk management, consumer products and sales practices, privacy , data protection, sustainability and executive compensation, among others.\n\nThe  scope  of  the  LRRs  and  the  intensity  of  th e  supervision  to  wh ich   we  are subject have continuously increased over the years. In addition, the banking and financial  services  sector  is  subject  to  substantial  regulatory  enforcement  and fines.  We  cannot  assess  whether  or  not  there  will  be  any  major  ch anges  in  th e regulatory  environment  and  expect  that  our  business  will  remain  subject  to continuing and extensive regulation and supervision.\n\nWe  are  also  subject  to  various  other  LRRs,  as  well  as  supervision  and examination by other regulatory agencies, all of which directly or indirectly affect our entities,  management  and  ability  to  make  distributions  to  shareholders.  For instance, our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to both U.S. and international regulation, including supervision by the SEC, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and New Y ork Stock Exchange, among others; our futures commission merchant subsidiary supporting commodities and derivatives businesses in the U.S. is subject to regulation by and supervision of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), National Futures Association, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and in the case of the Banks, certain banking regulators; our insurance activities  are  subject  to  licensing  and  regulation  by  state  insurance  regulatory agencies; and our consumer financial products and services are regulated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). In addition, certain U.S. and foreign subsidiaries are also registered with the CFTC as swap dealers, and conditionally registered with the SEC as security-based swap dealers.\n\nOur non-U.S. businesses are also subject to extensive regulation by various nonU.S. regulators, including governments, securities exchanges, prudential regulators, central banks and other regulatory bodies, in the jurisdictions in which those businesses operate. For example, our financial services entities are subject to regulation in the United Kingdom (U.K.) by the Prudential Regulatory Authority and Financial Conduct Authority , in Ireland by the European Central Bank (ECB) and the  Central  Bank  of  Ireland  and  in  F rance  by  the  ECB,  Autorit\u00e9  de  Contr\u00f4le Prudentiel et de R\u00e9solution and Autorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers.\n\nThe Corporation is also subject to extensive LRRs in the U.S. and in the other jurisdictions  in  which  it  operates  regarding  bribery  and  corruption,  know-yourcustomer requirements, anti-money laundering, embargo programs and economic sanctions. For example, we are subject to the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), which contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws designed to detect and  deter  money  laundering  and  the  financing  of  terrorism,  as  well  as  recordkeeping, reporting, due diligence and customer verification requirements, various sanctions  programs  administered  and  enforced  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OF AC) and foreign jurisdictions, which target entities or individuals that are, or are located in countries that are, involved in activities, such as terrorism, hostilities, drug trafficking or human rights violations and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCP A) and the U.K. Bribery Act, relating to corrupt and illegal payments to government officials and others. In 202 4, federal regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the OCC, proposed amendments to update the requirements for supervised institutions to establish, implement and maintain  effective,  risk-based  and  reasonably  designed  anti-money  laundering programs,  including  the  identification,  evaluation  and  documentation  of  money laundering risks.\n\n## Source of Strength\n\nUnder the 20 1 0 Dodd-F rank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Financial Reform Act) and Federal Reserve policy , BHCs are expected to act as a source of financial strength to each subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support each such subsidiary . Similarly , under the cross-guarantee provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 199 1 (FDICIA), in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the FDIC, either as a result of default of a bank  subsidiary  or  related  to  FDIC  assistance  provided  to  such  a  subsidiary  in danger of default, the affiliate banks of such a subsidiary may be assessed for the FDIC's loss, subject to certain exceptions.\n\n## Transactions with Affiliates\n\nPursuant to Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, as implemented by the Federal  Reserve's  Regulation  W ,  the  Banks  are  subject  to  restrictions  th at  limit certain types of transactions between the Banks and their nonbank affiliates. In general, U.S. banks are subject to quantitative and qualitative limits on extensions of  credit,  purchases  of  assets  and  certain  other  transactions  involving  their nonbank affiliates. Additionally , transactions between U.S. banks and their nonbank affiliates  are  req uired   to  b e  on  a rm 's  length   term s  a nd   m ust  b e  consistent  with standards of safety and soundness.",

      "answer": "The effective minimum CET1 capital ratio for American Express National Bank is 7.0%, which is 2.5 percentage points higher than the general minimum requirement of 4.5%. As a G-SIB, Bank of America faces additional capital buffers, including a G-SIB surcharge (now at 3.0%) and a Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) (now at 3.2%), which increase its overall capital requirements. These additional buffers, combined with the trend of increasing regulatory capital requirements, could constrain Bank of America's ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares, as it must maintain capital levels above these enhanced thresholds.",

F urther, in addition to the consent order referenced above regarding BSA/anti-money laundering  and economic sanctions compliance programs, we have entered into orders or settlements  with  certain  government  agencies  regarding  the  rates  paid  on uninvested cash in brokerage and investment advisory accounts that is swept into interest-paying  bank  deposits,  credit  card  sales  and  marketing  practices  and representment  fee  practices  and  our  participation  in  implementing  COVID-19related  government  relief  measures  and  other  federal  and  state  government assistance  programs,  including  the  processing  of  unemployment  benefits  for California and certain other states. We are subject to, or could become subject to, related litigation or investigations by other regulators with respect to the conduct that gave rise to these orders, or the orders or investigations we become subject to in the future, which may result in judgments and/or settlements.\n\nWe and our regulators have an increased focus on information security. This includes cybersecurity incidents perpetrated against us, our clients, providers of products and services, counterparties and other third parties, the collection, use and sharing of data, and safeguarding of personally identifiable information and corporate data, as well as the development, implementation, use and management of  emerging  technologies,  including  AI,  which  have  resulted  in,  and  will  likely continue to result in, related litigation or government enforcement, including with regard  to  compliance  with  U.S.  and  global LRRs, and  could  subject  us  to  fines, judgments and/or settlements and involve reputational losses. We expect to also face increasing scrutiny regarding sustainability-related policies, goals, targets and disclosure,  which  could  result  in  litigation,  regulatory  investigations  and   actions and  reputational  harm.  Misconduct,  or  the  perception  of  misconduct,  by  our employees and representatives, including conflicts of interest, unethical, fraudulent,  improper  or  illegal  conduct,  th e  failure  to  fulfill  fid uciary  ob ligations, unfair,  deceptive,  abusive  or  discriminatory  business  practices,  or  violations  of policies, procedures or LRRs, including conduct that affects compliance with books and records requirements, have resulted and could result in further litigation and/or government  investigations and enforcement  actions, and cause  significant reputational harm.\n\nThe  global  environment  of  extensive  investigations,  regulation,  regulatory compliance burdens, litigation and regulatory enforcement, combined with uncertainty  related  to  the  continually  evolving  regulatory  environment,  have affected and are likely to continue to affect operational and compliance costs and risks, including the adaptation of business strategies, the limitation or cessation of our ability or feasibility to continue providing certain products and services and our employment practices. Lawsuits and regulatory actions have resulted in and will likely  continue  to  result  in  jud gments,  ord ers,  settlements,  penalties  and  fines adverse to us, in amounts that may be significant or unpredictable, and in some cases,  exceed  the  amount  of  reserves  established.  Litigation  and  investigation costs,  substantial  legal  liability  or  significant  regulatory  or  government  action against  us  could  adversely  affect  our  businesses,  financial  condition,  including liq uid ity, a nd  re sults of op era tions, a nd / or ca use significa nt rep uta tiona l h a rm .\n\nU.S. federal banking agencies may  require increased capital  and liquidity levels, which could adversely im pact the Corporation.\n\nWe are subject to U.S. capital and liquidity regulations. These rules, among other things,  establish  minimum  ratios  relating  to  capital  for  different  categories  of assets and exposures to qualify as a well-capitalized institution. As a G-SIB, we are also required to hold additional capital buffers, including a G-SIB surcharge, a SCB and a countercyclical buffer, which are reassessed at least annually . Also, we are subject to regulatory liquidity requirements, including the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and  the  Net  Stable  F unding  Ratio.  If  any  of  our  subsidiary  insured  depository institutions fail to maintain 'well capitalized' status under the applicable regulatory capital  rules,  th e  Fed eral  R eserve  will  req uire  us  to  agree  to  b ring  th e  insured depository institution back to well-capitalized status, which may include restrictions on  our  activities,  such  as  our  ability  to  pay  d ivid end s  and /or  repurch ase  our common stock. If we were to fail to enter into or comply with such an agreement, the  Federal  Reserve  may  impose  more  severe  restrictions  on  our  activities, including requiring us to cease and desist activities otherwise permitted.\n\nFrom  time  to  time  regulators  may  change  regulatory  capital  requirements, including  total  loss-absorbing  capacity  (TLAC)  and  long-term  debt  requirements, change how regulatory capital or RWA  is calculated, or increase liq uid ity requirements. These components of our capital and liquidity ratios could also be impacted by economic disruptions or other events that may cause an increase in our balance sheet, RWA or leverage exposures, which could increase the amounts of regulatory capital or liquidity we are required to hold.\n\nIn  2023,  U.S.  banking  regulators  issued  notices  of  proposed  rulemaking  to revise the measurement of RWA and the G-SIB surcharge calculation, both of which may  be  re-proposed.  Also,  in  2023,  U.S.  banking  regulators  issued  proposed changes to the long-term debt requirements for TLAC, which may impact eligibility of certain debt instruments, and in 202 4, the Federal Reserve separately confirmed it is  considering  changes  to  existing,  as  well  as  new ,  liquid ity  requirements.  Th e timing and composition of any such proposals or re-proposals remain uncertain due to  various  factors,  including  changes  of  leadership  positions  in  the  U.S.  bank regulatory agencies.\n\nOur ability to pay dividends or repurchase common stock depends, in part, on our ability to maintain regulatory capital levels above minimum requirements plus buffers. If increases occur in our SCB, G-SIB surcharge or countercyclical capital buffer, our dividends and common stock repurchases, could decrease. For example, in  202 4,  our  SCB  increased  by  70  bps  to  3.2  percent  and  our  G-SIB  surcharge increased 50 bps to 3.0 percent. Our G-SIB surcharge is expected to increase to 3.5 percent from 3.0 percent in 202 7, and could further increase in the future. The Federal  Reserve  could  also  limit  or  prohibit  capital  actions  (e.g.,  impacts  to dividends and common stock repurchases) as a result of economic disruptions or events.\n\nExtensive regulatory evaluation of our capital planning practices by the Federal Reserve  includes  stress  testing  on  parts  of  our  business  using  hypothetical economic scenarios prepared by the Federal Reserve. Those scenarios may affect our CCAR stress test results, which may impact our SCB level and require us to hold additional  capital.  In  202 4,  th e  Fed eral  R eserve  announced  th at  it  intend s  to propose potential changes to bank stress tests, which could impact our SCB.\n\nChanges to and compliance with the regulatory capital and liq uid ity requirements  may  impact  our  operations  by  requiring  us  to  liquidate  assets, increase borrowings, issue additional securities, reduce common stock repurchases  or  dividends,  limit  compensation  practices, cease  or  alter  certain operations, pricing strategies and business activities or hold highly liquid assets, adversely affecting our results of operations.",

      "answer": "American Express is required to maintain a CET1 capital ratio of at least 7.0% under effective minimum capital regulations. If the company were to fall below this threshold, it could face regulatory restrictions similar to those described by Bank of America, including limitations on activities, restrictions on acquisitions, and heightened scrutiny from regulators like the Federal Reserve. These consequences stem from the requirement that financial holding companies must maintain minimum capital adequacy to retain eligibility for expanded financial activities, as emphasized in BAC's disclosures.",

          "chunk_text": "We  are  subject  to  an  extensive  regulatory  framework  applicable  to  BHCs, financial holding companies and banks and other financial services entities. U.S. federal  regulation  of  banks,  BHCs  and  financial  holding  companies  is  intended primarily  for  th e  p rotection  of  d ep ositors  a nd   th e  Dep osit  Insura nce  F und   (DIF) rather than for the protection of shareholders and creditors. As a registered financial holding company and BHC, the Corporation is subject to the supervision of, and regular  inspection  by ,  th e  Board  of  Governors  of  th e  Federal  R eserve  System (Federal  Reserve).  Our  U.S.  bank  subsidiaries  (the  Banks),  organized  as  national banking associations, are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Office  of  th e  Comptroller  of  th e  Currency  (OCC),  th e  Fed eral  Deposit  Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Federal Reserve. In addition, the Federal Reserve and the OCC have  adopted  guidelines  that  establish  minimum  standards  for  the  design, implementation and board oversight of BHCs' and national banks' risk governance frameworks.  U.S.  financial  holding  companies,  and  the  companies  under  their control, are permitted to engage in activities considered 'financial in nature' as defined by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and related Federal Reserve interpretations. The  Corporation's  status  as  a  financial  holding  company  is  conditioned  upon maintaining certain  eligibility  requirements  for  both  the  Corporation  and  its  U.S. depository institution subsidiaries, including minimum capital ratios, supervisory ratings  and,  in  the  case  of  the  depository  institutions,  at  least  satisfactory Community Reinvestment  Act  ratings.  Failure  to  be  an  eligible  financial  holding company could result in the Federal Reserve limiting Bank of America's activities, including  potential  acquisitions.  Additionally ,  we  are  subject  to  a  significant number of laws, rules and regulations (LRRs) that govern our businesses in the U.S. and in the other jurisdictions in which we operate, including permissible activities, minimum levels of capital and liquidity , compliance risk management, consumer products and sales practices, privacy , data protection, sustainability and executive compensation, among others.\n\nThe  scope  of  the  LRRs  and  the  intensity  of  th e  supervision  to  wh ich   we  are subject have continuously increased over the years. In addition, the banking and financial  services  sector  is  subject  to  substantial  regulatory  enforcement  and fines.  We  cannot  assess  whether  or  not  there  will  be  any  major  ch anges  in  th e regulatory  environment  and  expect  that  our  business  will  remain  subject  to continuing and extensive regulation and supervision.\n\nWe  are  also  subject  to  various  other  LRRs,  as  well  as  supervision  and examination by other regulatory agencies, all of which directly or indirectly affect our entities,  management  and  ability  to  make  distributions  to  shareholders.  For instance, our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to both U.S. and international regulation, including supervision by the SEC, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and New Y ork Stock Exchange, among others; our futures commission merchant subsidiary supporting commodities and derivatives businesses in the U.S. is subject to regulation by and supervision of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), National Futures Association, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and in the case of the Banks, certain banking regulators; our insurance activities  are  subject  to  licensing  and  regulation  by  state  insurance  regulatory agencies; and our consumer financial products and services are regulated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). In addition, certain U.S. and foreign subsidiaries are also registered with the CFTC as swap dealers, and conditionally registered with the SEC as security-based swap dealers.\n\nOur non-U.S. businesses are also subject to extensive regulation by various nonU.S. regulators, including governments, securities exchanges, prudential regulators, central banks and other regulatory bodies, in the jurisdictions in which those businesses operate. For example, our financial services entities are subject to regulation in the United Kingdom (U.K.) by the Prudential Regulatory Authority and Financial Conduct Authority , in Ireland by the European Central Bank (ECB) and the  Central  Bank  of  Ireland  and  in  F rance  by  the  ECB,  Autorit\u00e9  de  Contr\u00f4le Prudentiel et de R\u00e9solution and Autorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers.\n\nThe Corporation is also subject to extensive LRRs in the U.S. and in the other jurisdictions  in  which  it  operates  regarding  bribery  and  corruption,  know-yourcustomer requirements, anti-money laundering, embargo programs and economic sanctions. For example, we are subject to the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), which contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws designed to detect and  deter  money  laundering  and  the  financing  of  terrorism,  as  well  as  recordkeeping, reporting, due diligence and customer verification requirements, various sanctions  programs  administered  and  enforced  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OF AC) and foreign jurisdictions, which target entities or individuals that are, or are located in countries that are, involved in activities, such as terrorism, hostilities, drug trafficking or human rights violations and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCP A) and the U.K. Bribery Act, relating to corrupt and illegal payments to government officials and others. In 202 4, federal regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the OCC, proposed amendments to update the requirements for supervised institutions to establish, implement and maintain  effective,  risk-based  and  reasonably  designed  anti-money  laundering programs,  including  the  identification,  evaluation  and  documentation  of  money laundering risks.\n\n## Source of Strength\n\nUnder the 20 1 0 Dodd-F rank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Financial Reform Act) and Federal Reserve policy , BHCs are expected to act as a source of financial strength to each subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support each such subsidiary . Similarly , under the cross-guarantee provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 199 1 (FDICIA), in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the FDIC, either as a result of default of a bank  subsidiary  or  related  to  FDIC  assistance  provided  to  such  a  subsidiary  in danger of default, the affiliate banks of such a subsidiary may be assessed for the FDIC's loss, subject to certain exceptions.\n\n## Transactions with Affiliates\n\nPursuant to Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, as implemented by the Federal  Reserve's  Regulation  W ,  the  Banks  are  subject  to  restrictions  th at  limit certain types of transactions between the Banks and their nonbank affiliates. In general, U.S. banks are subject to quantitative and qualitative limits on extensions of  credit,  purchases  of  assets  and  certain  other  transactions  involving  their nonbank affiliates. Additionally , transactions between U.S. banks and their nonbank affiliates  are  req uired   to  b e  on  a rm 's  length   term s  a nd   m ust  b e  consistent  with standards of safety and soundness.",

      "answer": "Under an adverse macroeconomic scenario, Bank of America's allowance for credit losses could hypothetically increase by approximately $4.8 billion compared to the baseline scenario. This sensitivity analysis assumes a peak U.S. unemployment rate over two percentage points higher than the baseline, a decline in U.S. real GDP followed by a prolonged recovery, and a lower home price outlook with a difference of approximately 19% at the trough. To address the uncertainty in this estimate, Bank of America has implemented a model validation policy that requires review and approval of quantitative models used for financial statement fair value determination and risk quantification, helping ensure the reliability of these models despite the inherent uncertainties in forecasting credit losses.",

To manage this risk, we seek to maintain access to a diverse set of cash, readilymarketable securities and contingent sources of liquidity, such that we can continuously meet our business requirements and expected future financing obligations for at least a twelve-month period under a variety of adverse circumstances. These include, but are not limited to, an event where we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. We consider the trade-offs between maintaining too much liquidity, which can be costly and limit financial flex ibility, and having inadequate liquidity, which may result in financial distress during a liquidity event.\n\nFunding and liquidity risk is managed at an aggregate consolidated level as well as at certain subsidiaries in order to ensure that sufficient and accessible liquidity resources are maintained. The Funding and Liquidity Committee reviews forecasts of our aggregate and subsidiary cash positions and financing requirements, approves funding plans designed to satisfy those requirements under normal and stressed conditions, establishes guidelines to identify the amount of liquidity resources required and monitors positions and determines any actions to be taken.\n\nOur liquidity risk management processes are designed in alignment with regulatory guidelines. As a Category III firm under U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies' rules, we are subject to heightened capital, liquidity and prudential requirements, including more stringent liquidity risk management requirements. See 'Supervision and Regulation - Capital and Liquidity Regulation' under 'Business' for more information.\n\n## MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS\n\nWe define model risk as the risk of adverse consequences, such as financial loss, poor business and strategic decision making, damage to our reputation or customer harm, from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and outcomes.\n\nThe Enterprise-Wide Model Risk Policy establishes the comprehensive framework for governing model risk. This policy is approved by the ERMC. The comprehensive risk management and governance framework includes procedures for model development, independent model validation, model risk reporting and change management capabilities that seek to minimize erroneous model methodology, outputs, and misuse. We also assess model performance and model- related issues on an ongoing basis and seek to address deficiencies in a timely manner. In addition, we utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) models, including Generative AI tools, for a variety of business use cases. We perform extensive reviews and testing to reduce the risk that these AI/ML techniques result in adverse consequences.\n\n## STRATEGIC AND BUSINESS RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS\n\nWe define strategic and business risk as the risk related to our inability to achieve our business objectives due to poor strategic decisions, including decisions related to the launch or modification of products, mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures, poor implementation of strategic decisions or declining demand for our products and services.\n\nStrategic decisions are reviewed and approved by business leaders and various committees and must be aligned with company policies. We seek to manage strategic and business risks through risk controls embedded in these processes as well as overall risk management oversight over business goals. Launch of key new products as well as existing product performance is reviewed periodically by committees and business leaders to inform business decisions as appropriate. Mergers, acquisitions and divestitures can only be approved following Executive Committee due diligence, a comprehensive risk assessment by operational, market, credit and oversight leaders provided to the Chief Risk Officer and approval by either the Chief Risk Officer or appropriate risk committees. All new and material changes to products and services are reviewed and approved by the New Products Committee and appropriate credit or risk committees.",

( 1)\n\nIn  addition  to  th e  ab ove  jud gments  and   estimates,  th e  allowance  for  cred it losses  can  also  be  impacted  by  unanticipated  changes  in  asset  quality  of  the portfolio, such as increases or decreases in credit and/or internal risk ratings in our commercial  portfolio,  improvement  or  deterioration  in  borrower  delinquencies  or credit scores in our credit card portfolio and increases or decreases in home prices, which is a primary driver of LTVs, in our consumer real estate portfolio, all of  which  have  some  degree  of  uncertainty .  The  allowance  for  credit  losses decreased $2 15 million from $1 4.6 billion at December 3 1, 2023 to $1 4.3 billion at  December  3 1,  202 4,  primarily  due  to  a  reserve  release  in  our  commercial portfolio due to a favorable macroeconomic environment and reduced exposure in our commercial real estate portfolio.\n\nTo provide an illustration of the sensitivity of the macroeconomic scenarios and other  assumptions  on  the  estimate  of  our  allowance  for  credit  losses,  the Corporation  compared  the  December  3 1,  202 4  modeled  ECL  from  the  baseline scenario  to  our  adverse  scenario.  Relative  to  th e  b aseline  scenario,  th e  ad verse scenario assumed a peak U.S. unemployment rate of over two percentage points higher than the baseline scenario, a decline in U.S. real GDP followed by a prolonged recovery  and  a  lower  home  price  outlook  with  a  difference  of  approximately  19 percent at the trough. This sensitivity analysis resulted in a hypothetical increase in the allowance for credit losses of approximately $4.8 billion.\n\nWhile the sensitivity analysis may be useful to consider how changes in certain macroeconomic  assumptions  could  impact  our  baseline  ECLs,  it  should  not  be relied  upon  as  a  forecast  of  h ow  our  allowance  for  cred it  losses  is  expected   to change  in  a  different  macroeconomic  outlook.  Ultimately ,  the  estimate  of  the allowance  for  credit  losses  is  dependent  upon  a  variety  of  potential  factors including,  but  not  limited  to,  qualitative  assessments,  weighting  of  alternate macroeconomic  scenarios  and  changes  in  portfolio  mix  that  would  need  to  be considered comprehensively in determining the allowance for credit losses. Due to the  uncertainty  in  predicting  these  factors,  they  are  not  incorporated  into  the sensitivity analysis.\n\n## Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nUnder  applicable  accounting  standards,  we  are  required  to  maximize  the  use  of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value.  We  classify  fair  value  measurements  of  financial  instruments  and  MSRs based on the three-level fair value hierarchy in the accounting standards.\n\nThe  fair  values  of  assets  and  liabilities  may  include  adjustments,  such  as market liquidity and credit quality , where appropriate. V aluations of products using models or other techniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the significant inputs. Where market data is available, the inputs used for valuation reflect that information  as  of  our  valuation  date.  Inputs  to  valuation  models  are  considered unobservable  if  they  are  supported  by  little  or  no  market  activity .  In  period s  of extreme  volatility ,  lessened  liquid ity  or  in  illiq uid   markets,  th ere  may  b e  more variability in market pricing or a lack of market data to use in the valuation process. In keeping with the prudent application of estimates and management judgment in determining  the  fair  value  of  assets  and  liabilities,  we  have  in  place  various processes and controls that include: a model validation policy that requires review and approval of quantitative models used for deal pricing, financial statement fair value determination and risk quantification; a trading product valuation policy that requires  verification  of  all  trad ed   p rod uct  valuations;  and   a  p eriod ic  review  and substantiation of daily profit and loss reporting for all traded products. Primarily through validation controls, we utilize both broker and pricing service inputs which can and do include both market-observable and internally-modeled values and/or valuation inputs. Our reliance on this information is affected by our understanding of how the broker and/or pricing service develops its data with a higher degree of reliance  applied  to  th ose  th at  are  more  d irectly  ob servab le  and   lesser  reliance applied to those developed through their own",

In contrast, WFC explicitly agrees to furnish upon request a copy of each instrument defining the rights of holders of both senior and subordinated debt, indicating active involvement with subordinated debt instruments. This contrast implies that WFC has greater exposure to subordinated debt risk compared to C, which has none under the modeled adverse scenarios.",

      "question": "How does the requirement for FRB approval prior to implementing certain risk-weighted asset treatments impact both Citi's regulatory capital management and Wells Fargo's ability to engage in new financial activities, and what specific regulatory thresholds or conditions trigger these impacts?",
      "answer": "Citi is required to obtain preapproval from the FRB prior to implementing certain risk-weighted asset treatments, which makes managing its risk-weighted assets more challenging and can lead to changes that negatively impact its capital ratios and regulatory capital requirements. Wells Fargo, as a financial holding company, must also obtain FRB approval before acquiring control of another bank or financial institution if its total resulting consolidated liabilities would exceed 10% of the aggregate consolidated liabilities of all financial companies. This regulatory threshold directly constrains Wells Fargo\u2019s ability to expand through acquisitions or engage in new financial activities without FRB consent. Both firms are therefore significantly constrained in strategic decision-making due to FRB oversight tied to their capital structure and expansion plans.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, Citi must obtain FRB preapproval for certain risk-weighted asset treatments, which affects its ability to manage regulatory capital and can result in changes that negatively impact capital ratios.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, Wells Fargo must obtain FRB approval before any acquisition that would cause its consolidated liabilities to exceed 10% of the total liabilities of all financial companies, restricting its ability to grow or diversify.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are subject to FRB approval for different but significant activities: Citi for internal capital modeling and asset treatments, and Wells Fargo for external acquisitions and expansion into financial activities. This shared regulatory requirement limits strategic flexibility in different but parallel ways."

          "chunk_text": "circumstances, or identify changes in markets or client behaviors not yet inherent in historical data.\n\nCiti could incur significant losses, receive negative regulatory evaluation or ex amination findings or be subject to additional enforcement actions, and its regulatory capital, capital ratios and ability to return capital could be negatively impacted, if Citi's risk management and other processes, including its ability to manage and aggregate data in a timely and accurate manner, strategies or models are deficient or ineffective. For additional information, see the capital return risk factor above and the heightened regulatory scrutiny and ongoing interpretation of regulatory changes risk factor below. Such deficiencies or ineffectiveness could also result in inaccurate financial, regulatory or risk reporting.\n\nMoreover, Citi's Basel III regulatory capital models, including its credit, market and operational risk models, currently remain subject to ongoing regulatory review and approval, which may result in refinements, modifications or enhancements (required or otherwise) to these models. Citi is required to notify and obtain preapproval from both the OCC and FRB prior to implementing certain risk-weighted asset treatments, as well as certain model changes, resulting in a more challenging environment within which Citi must operate in managing its risk-weighted assets. Modifications or requirements resulting from these ongoing reviews, as well as any future changes or guidance provided by the U.S. banking regulators regarding the U.S. regulatory capital framework applicable to Citi, including, but not limited to, potential revisions to the U.S. Basel III rules (see the capital return risk factor and 'Capital Resources-Regulatory Capital Standards and Developments' above), have resulted, and could continue to result, in significant changes to Citi's risk-weighted assets. These changes can negatively impact Citi's capital ratios and its ability to meet its regulatory capital requirements.\n\n## CREDIT RISKS\n\n## Credit Risk and Concentrations of Risk Can Increase the Potential for Citi to Incur Significant Losses.\n\nCiti has credit ex posures to consumer, corporate and public sector borrowers and other counterparties in the U.S. and various countries and jurisdictions globally, including end-ofperiod consumer loans of $393 billion and end-of-period corporate loans of $301 billion at December 31, 2024. For additional information on Citi's corporate and consumer loan portfolios, see 'Managing Global Risk-Corporate Credit' and '-Consumer Credit' below. For information on Citi's credit and country risk, see also each respective business's results of operations above and 'Managing Global Risk-Other Risks-Country Risk' below and Notes 15 and 16.\n\nA default by or a significant downgrade in the credit ratings of a borrower or other counterparty, or a decline in the credit quality or value of any underlying collateral, ex poses Citi to credit risk. Additionally, despite Citi's target client strategy, various macroeconomic, geopolitical, market and other factors, among other things, can increase Citi's credit risk and credit costs, particularly for vulnerable sectors, industries or countries (see the macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties and co-branding and private label credit card risk factors above and the emerging markets risk factor below). For example, a weakening of economic conditions can adversely affect borrowers' ability to repay their obligations, as well as result in Citi being unable to liquidate the collateral it holds or forced to liquidate the collateral at prices that do not cover the full amount owed to Citi.\n\nCiti is also a member of various central clearing counterparties and could incur financial losses as a result of defaults by other clearing members due to the requirements of clearing members to share losses. Additionally, due to the interconnectedness among financial institutions, concerns about the creditworthiness of or defaults by a financial institution could spread to other financial market participants and result in market-wide losses and disruption. For example, the failure of regional banks and other banking stresses in recent years resulted in market volatility across the financial sector.\n\nWhile Citi provides reserves for expected losses for its credit ex posures, as applicable, such reserves are subject to judgments and estimates that could be incorrect or differ from actual future events. For additional information, see the incorrect assumptions or estimates risk factor above.\n\nConcentrations of risk to clients or counterparties engaged in the same or related industries or doing business in a particular geography, or to a particular product or asset class, especially credit and market risks, can also increase Citi's risk of significant losses. For ex ample, Citi routinely executes a high volume of securities, trading, derivative and foreign ex change transactions with non-U.S. sovereigns and with counterparties in the financial services industry, including banks, insurance companies, investment banks, governments, central banks and other financial institutions. Moreover, Citi has indemnification obligations in connection with various transactions that expose it to concentrations of risk, including credit risk from hedging or reinsurance arrangements related to those obligations (see Note 28). A rapid deterioration of a large borrower or other counterparty or within a sector or country in which Citi has large exposures or indemnifications or unexpected market dislocations could lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of other borrowers or counterparties in a certain geography and in related or dependent industries, and such conditions could cause Citi to incur significant losses.\n\n## LIQUIDITY RISKS\n\n## Citi's Businesses, Results of Operations and Financial Condition Could Be Negatively Impacted if It Does Not Effectively Manage Its Liquidity.\n\nAs a large, global financial institution, adequate liquidity and sources of funding are essential to Citi's businesses. Citi's liquidity, sources of funding and costs of funding can be significantly and negatively impacted by factors it cannot control, such as general disruptions in the financial markets; changes in fiscal and monetary policies; regulatory requirements, including changes in regulations; negative investor or counterparty perceptions of Citi's creditworthiness; deposit outflows or unfavorable changes in deposit mix; unexpected increases in cash or collateral requirements; credit ratings; and the consequent inability to monetize available liquidity resources. In addition, Citi competes with other banks",

The financial services industry is also becoming more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial products and services, including electronic and internet-based financial solutions such as electronic securities trading, lending and payment solutions, as well as digital currencies and alternative payment methods. These technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties.\n\n## REGULATION AND SUPERVISION\n\nThe U.S. financial services industry is subject to significant regulation and regulatory oversight initiativ es. This regulation and oversight may continue to impact how U.S. financial services companies conduct business and may continue to result in increased regulatory compliance costs.\n\nBanking statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review by Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies, as well as non-U.S. governments and financial regulators, and a change in them, including changes in how they are interpreted or implemented, could have a material effect on our business. The regulatory framework applicable to depository institutions and bank holding companies (BHCs) is intended to protect depositors, the federal deposit insurance fund, consumers and the banking system as a whole, and not necessarily investors in BHCs such as the Company.\n\nStatutes, regulations, and policies could restrict our ability to div ersify  into other areas of financial services, make acquisitions, and pay dividends or repurchase our capital stock. They may also require us to provide financial support to one or more of our subsidiary banks, maintain capital in excess of amounts desired by management, and pay higher deposit insurance premiums as a result of assessments or a general deterioration in the financial condition of depository institutions.\n\nThe following describes the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to us and the more significant regulations and regulatory oversight initiativ es that hav e affected or may  affect our business. For additional information about the regulatory matters discussed below and other regulations and regulatory oversight matters, see the 'Overview,' 'Capital M anagement,' 'Forward-Looking Statements' and 'Risk Factors' sections and Note 26 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) to Financial Statements in the 2024 A nnual Report to Shareholders.\n\n## General\n\nParent Bank Holding Company. As a BHC, the Parent is subject to regulation under the BHC Act and to inspection, examination and supervision by its primary regulator, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board or FRB). The Parent is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities A ct of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, both as administered by the SEC. As a company with securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the Parent is subject to the rules of the NY SE for listed companies.\n\nSubsidiary Banks. Our subsidiary national banks, and their subsidiaries, are subject to regulation and examination primarily by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and also by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the FRB, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The non-\n\nU.S. branches, subsidiaries, and offices of our subsidiary national banks are subject to regulation and examination by their respective financial regulators as well as by the OCC and the FRB. Non-U.S. operations of our national bank subsidiaries may be subject to the laws and regulations of the countries in which they conduct business.\n\nNonbank Subsidiaries. Many of our nonbank subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the FRB and other applicable federal and state agencies. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by applicable state insurance regulatory agencies, as well as the FRB. Our brokerage subsidiaries are regulated by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA ) and, in some cases, the CFTC and the M unicipal Securities Rulemaking Board, and state securities regulators. Our other nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to the laws and regulations of the federal government and/or the various states as well as non-U.S. countries in which they conduct business or operate.\n\n## Parent Bank Holding Company Activities\n\n'Financial in Nature' Requirement. We became a financial holding company (FHC) effective M arch 13, 2000. We continue to maintain our status as a BHC for purposes of various FRB regulations. A s a BHC that has elected to be treated as an FHC pursuant to the BHC Act, we may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature. 'Financial in nature' activ ities include securities underwriting, dealing, and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; merchant banking; and activities that the FRB, in consultation with the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activ ity . 'Complementary activ ities' are activ ities that the FRB determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a safety and soundness risk. Financial in nature activities and incidental or complementary activities are collectively referred to below as 'financial activ ities'.\n\nFRB approval is generally not required for us to acquire a company (other than a BHC, bank or savings association) engaged in financial activities, as determined by the FRB. Prior notice to the FRB may be required, however, if the company to be acquired has total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. Prior FRB approval is required before we may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a BHC, bank or savings association. We are also subject to prohibitions on our ability to merge, acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or acquire control of another company if our total resulting consolidated liabilities would exceed 10% of the aggregate consolidated liabilities of all financial companies.\n\nBecause we are an FHC, if any of our applicable subsidiary banks receives a rating under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, as amended (CRA), of less than satisfactory, we will be prohibited, until the rating is raised to satisfactory or better, from engaging in certain new financial activ ities or acquiring certain companies engaged in financial activities. CRA  performance is also considered by regulators in reviewing applications to establish bank branches. In addition, if the FRB finds that an FHC or any one of its subsidiary banks is not well capitalized or well managed, the FHC would be required to enter into an agreement with the FRB to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements and which may contain additional limitations or conditions. Until corrected, the FHC could be prohibited from engaging in any new financial activity or",

      "question": "How do the leverage ratio requirements influence dividend distributions at both Citigroup and Wells Fargo, particularly considering Citigroup's $5.5 billion in dividends received from Citibank in 2024 and the specific regulatory triggers that restrict Wells Fargo's Parent liquidity when capital metrics fall below defined thresholds?",
      "answer": "Citigroup's ability to receive dividends from Citibank is directly tied to its compliance with leverage ratio requirements, as Citibank must consider the impact of dividend payments on its regulatory capital metrics. In 2024, Citigroup received $5.5 billion in dividends indirectly from Citibank, which indicates that Citibank remained above the required leverage ratio thresholds to permit such distributions. In contrast, Wells Fargo\u2019s Parent company faces explicit restrictions under the Support Agreement: if certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers, the Intermediate Holding Company (IHC) may be restricted from making dividend payments to the Parent. This would directly impact the Parent\u2019s liquidity and ability to service debt or pay dividends. Therefore, both companies are constrained by leverage ratio requirements, but the mechanisms differ\u2014Citigroup is limited through general regulatory oversight of its banking subsidiary, while Wells Fargo faces contractual and conditional restrictions tied to specific capital triggers.",

Under the Support Agreement, the IHC will also provide funding and liquidity to the Parent through subordinated notes and a committed line of credit, which, together with the issuance of dividends, is expected to provide the Parent, during business as usual operating conditions, with the same access to cash necessary to service its debts, pay dividends, repurchase its shares, and perform its other obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. If certain liquidity  and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers, or if the Parent's board of directors authorizes it to file a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the subordinated notes would be forgiven, the committed line of credit would terminate, and the IHC's ability to pay dividends to the Parent would be restricted, any of which could materially and adversely impact the Parent's liquidity and its ability to satisfy  its debts and other obligations, and could result in the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the Parent at an earlier time than might have otherwise occurred if the Support A greement were not implemented. The respective obligations under the Support A greement of the Parent, the IHC, the Bank, and the Related Support Entities are secured pursuant to a related security agreement.\n\nRecovery Plan . In addition to our resolution plans, we must also prepare and periodically submit to the FRB a recovery plan that identifies a range of options that we may consider during times of idiosyncratic or systemic economic stress to remedy any financial weaknesses and restore market confidence without extraordinary government support. Recovery options include the possible sale, transfer or disposal of assets, securities, loan portfolios or businesses. The Bank must also prepare and periodically submit to the OCC a recovery plan that sets forth the Bank's plan to remain a going concern when the Bank is experiencing considerable financial or operational stress, but has not yet deteriorated to the point where liquidation or resolution is imminent. If either the FRB or the OCC determines that our recovery plan is deficient, they may impose fines, restrictions on our business or ultimately require us to divest assets.\n\n## Dividend and Share Repurchase Restrictions\n\nThe Parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary banks and other subsidiaries. A  significant source of funds to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and principal and interest on our debt is dividends from the Parent's subsidiaries. V arious federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends the Parent's subsidiary banks and certain other subsidiaries may pay without regulatory approval. Federal banking regulators have the authority to prohibit the Parent's subsidiary banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses. The payment of dividends, depending on the financial condition of the bank in question, could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice. Similarly, as part of their supervisory authority, regulators may limit or restrict subsidiary capital distributions. The ability  of the Parent's subsidiary banks to pay dividends in the future is currently, and could be further, influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital requirements. For information about the restrictions applicable to the Parent's subsidiary banks, see\n\nNote 26 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) to Financial Statements in the 2024 A nnual Report to Shareholders.\n\nFurthermore, under the Support Agreement, the IHC may be restricted from making dividend payments to the Parent if certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers, or if the Parent's board of directors authorizes it to file a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. A ny such restriction could materially and adversely impact the Parent's liquidity and its ability  to satisfy  its debt and other obligations, as well as its ability  to make dividend payments on its common and preferred stock. See the 'Risk Factors' section of the 2024 A nnual Report to Shareholders for additional information on the Support A greement.\n\nIn addition to these restrictions on the ability  of our subsidiary  banks to pay dividends to us, the FRB requires large BHCs, including Wells Fargo, to submit annual capital plans describing planned capital distributions, such as the payment of dividends and share repurchases. Large BHCs, like Wells Fargo, and their insured depository institutions also must comply with various capital requirements, including the reforms known as Basel III, as well as rules that establish leverage and supplementary leverage ratio requirements. We are also subject to the FRB's rule implementing an additional capital surcharge on those U.S. banking organizations, such as the Company, that are designated as global systemically important banks (GSIBs). The failure to meet any of these requirements could result in limitations or restrictions on our ability  to make capital distributions.\n\nIn addition, the FRB's enhanced supervision regulations for large BHCs, like Wells Fargo, impose capital distribution restrictions, including on the payment of dividends, upon the occurrence of capital, stress test, risk management, or liquidity risk management triggers. For additional information on regulations or arrangements that may impose capital distribution restrictions on the Company and its subsidiaries, see the 'Capital M anagement' and 'Risk Factors' sections of the 2024 A nnual Report to Shareholders.\n\n## Deposit Insurance Assessments\n\nThe Company's subsidiaries include banks, such as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., that are insured by the FDIC. Through the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) maintained by the FDIC, the FDIC insures the deposits of our insured banks up to prescribed limits for each depositor and funds the DIF through assessments on member banks. To maintain the DIF, member institutions are assessed an insurance premium based on an assessment base and an assessment rate.\n\nThe FDIC has adopted a comprehensive, long-range plan for DIF management, targeting a designated reserve ratio of 2%. In addition, the FDIC may recover by special assessment on member banks losses to the DIF as a result of resolving a failed bank. For additional information about our FDIC deposit assessment expense, see Note 21 (Revenue and Expenses) to Financial Statements in the 2024 A nnual Report to Shareholders.\n\nThe FDIC may terminate a depository institution's deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution's financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution or its directors hav e engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or have violated any applicable law, regulation, order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution's regulatory agency. The termination of deposit insurance for one or more of our bank subsidiaries could result in a significant loss of deposits and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and earnings, depending on the collective size of the particular banks involved.",

The Luxembourg insurance regulator, the Commissariat aux A ssurances, is the insurance regulator for A IG Europe SA , which serves our European Economic A rea (EEA ) and Swiss policyholders. In addition, financial companies that operate in the EU are subject to a range of regulations enforced by the national regulators in each member state in which that firm operates. Solvency II governs the insurance industry's solvency framework for the EU, including minimum capital and solvency requirements, governance requirements, risk management and public reporting standards applicable to A IG's subsidiaries operating in the EU.\n\nAIG's operating insurance subsidiaries in Bermuda are regulated by the Bermuda M onetary A uthority (BM A ). Bermuda's Insurance A ct 1978, the applicable Codes of Conduct and related regulations impose solvency and liquidity standards and auditing and reporting requirements on Bermuda insurance companies and grant the BM A powers to supervise, investigate and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies. A  variety of requirements and restrictions are imposed on our Bermuda operating insurance subsidiaries including: periodic financial reporting; corporate governance framework; solvency and financial performance; compliance with minimum enhanced capital requirements; minimum solvency margins and liquidity ratios; and limitations on dividends and distributions.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (M A S) supervises A IG's insurance subsidiary in Singapore. It has broad authority under the Insurance A ct 1966 to regulate insurance business in Singapore as well as insurers, insurance intermediaries and related institutions. Our Singapore insurance operations are subject to minimum capital and solvency requirements as well as financial reporting, corporate governance and conduct of business requirements. The M A S has authority to conduct inspections and investigations on insurers and to administer sanctions for regulatory non-compliance. Our Singapore insurance subsidiary holds insurance entities in the A sia Pacific region. The M A S holds the Chief Executive Officer of the Singapore insurance subsidiary principally responsible for the management and conduct of the business of the subsidiary, including the business of its subsidiaries and overseas branches.\n\nThe Japan Financial Services Agency (JFSA) regulates AIG's operating insurance subsidiaries and insurance holding company in Japan. The JFSA has extensive authority under the Insurance Business A ct and related regulations to oversee licensing, sales practices, business conduct, investments, reserves and solvency, amongst other matters. Our Japanese insurance operations are required to maintain a minimum solvency margin ratio (SM R), which is a measure of capital adequacy. The failure to maintain an appropriate SM R, or comply with other similar indicators of financial health, could result in the JFSA  imposing corrective actions on our operations.\n\n## FSB and IAIS\n\nThe Financial Stability Board (FSB) consists of representatives of national financial authorities of the G20 countries. The FSB is not a regulator but is focused primarily on promoting international financial stability. The FSB has issued a series of frameworks and recommendations to address such issues as systemic financial risk, financial group supervision, capital and solvency standards, effective recovery and resolution regimes, corporate governance including compensation, and a number of related issues associated with responses to the financial crisis.\n\nThe International A ssociation of Insurance Supervisors (IA IS) represents insurance regulators and supervisors of more than 200 jurisdictions (including regions and states) in nearly 140 countries and seeks to promote globally consistent insurance industry supervision. The IA IS is not a regulator, but one of its activities is to develop insurance regulatory standards for use by local authorities across the globe. For example, the IA IS has adopted a Common Framework (ComFrame) for the Supervision of Internationally A ctiv e Insurance Groups (IA IGs). ComFrame assists regulators in addressing an IA IG's risks by providing supervisory standards for areas such as group supervision, governance and internal controls, enterprise risk management, and recovery and resolution planning. We currently meet the criteria set forth to identify an IAIG, and the NY DFS, as our group-wide supervisor, has publicly disclosed us as an IA IG on the IA IS' register of IA IGs.\n\nWhile the FSB no longer identifies global systemically important insurers (G-SIIs); in its place the IA IS has adopted an enhanced set of supervisory policy measures for the assessment and mitigation of systemic risk in the insurance sector (Holistic Framework). The Holistic Framework recognizes that systemic risk can emanate from specific activities and exposures arising from either sector-wide trends or concentrations in individual insurers. The FSB has also been engaging with member jurisdictions in order to encourage greater adherence to its 'Key A ttributes for Effective Resolution Regimes for the Insurance Sector' to ensure that large, internationally active insurers can exit the market in an orderly fashion and avoid the need for taxpayer bailouts. Starting in December 2024 the FSB began publishing an annual list of insurers, including A IG, that are subject to resolution planning requirements.\n\nAs part of ComFrame, the IAIS also developed a risk-based global Insurance Capital Standard (ICS) applicable to IA IGs. The IA IS formally adopted the ICS at its annual general meeting in December 2024. The ICS is intended to be applied as a group-wide prescribed capital requirement, defined as a solvency control level above which the supervisor does not intervene on capital adequacy grounds. In parallel, the United States developed the A ggregation M ethod (A M ) as an alternative approach to the consolidated ICS group-capital calculation. Following a comparability assessment, the IA IS determined in November 2024 that the A M  delivers comparable outcomes to the ICS and therefore provides the basis for implementation of the ICS. The A M  will be implemented in the United States through the GCC.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n\n9",

(a  wholly-owned subsidiary) holds licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in the states where such licenses are required, as well as in the District of Columbia and certain territories. If we fail to comply with applicable laws or regulations required to maintain our licenses, we could be subject to liability and/or additional restrictions, forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states or territories, forced to change our business practices, or required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals, which could impose substantial costs and harm our business.\n\nWhile we currently allow our customers to send payments from approximately 200 markets, we allow customers in only approximately half of those markets (including the  U.S.)  to  also  receive  payments,  in  some  cases  with  significant  restrictions  on  the  manner  in  which  customers  can  hold  balances  or  withdraw  funds.  These restrictions may limit our ability to grow our business.\n\nWe principally provide our services to customers in the European Economic Area ('EEA') through PayPal (Europe) S.\u00e0.r.l. et Cie, S.C.A. ('PayPal (Europe)'), our wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a credit institution in Luxembourg and PayPal U.K. Limited ('PayPal U.K.'), a wholly-owned subsidiary that is subject to regulation as an electronic money institution and a consumer credit firm (and registration as a crypto asset business) in the United Kingdom ('U.K.') by the Financial Conduct Authority ('FCA'). PayPal (Europe) or PayPal U.K. may be subject to enforcement actions and significant fines and penalties if either violates applicable requirements. If the business activities of PayPal (Europe) ex ceed certain thresholds, or if the European Central Bank ('ECB') so determines, PayPal (Europe) may be deemed a significant supervised entity and certain activities of PayPal (Europe) would become directly supervised by the ECB, rather than by the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier. PayPal (Europe) is also subject to regulation by the ECB under the oversight framework for electronic payment instruments, schemes and arrangements ('PISA'). Compliance with applicable laws and regulations could become more costly and operationally difficult to manage due to additional supervision, potentially inconsistent interpretations, and domestic regulations by various countries in the region. Applicable  regulation  relating  to  payments,  anti-money  laundering,  and  digital  services,  which  are  key  focus  areas  of  regulators  and  subject  to  ex tensive  new regulation, could subject us to additional and complex obligations, risks, and associated costs, and impact our ability to ex pand our business in Europe.\n\nFor  many of the other markets outside the  U.S., we provide services on a cross-border basis through  PayPal  Pte.  Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary based in Singapore. PayPal Pte. Ltd. is supervised by the Monetary Authority of Singapore ('MAS'). As of July 1, 2023, PayPal Pte. Ltd. has been issued a Major Payment Institution license by the MAS under the Payment Services Act 2019. In order to maintain this license and certain other licenses or registrations we hold in certain markets, we are required to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, which have imposed and will continue to impose increasing operational complexity and costs for our  Singapore and international operations.  Moreover, in many non-U.S. markets (other than Singapore) where customers of PayPal Pte. Ltd. or local branches or subsidiaries subject to local regulatory supervision or oversight, as the case may be, are located, there may be uncertainty whether our Singapore-based service is subject only to Singapore law or also to other local laws, and whether such local laws might require a payment processor like us to be licensed as a payments service, bank, financial institution, or otherwise.\n\nThere are substantial costs and potential product and operational changes involved in maintaining and renewing licenses, certifications, and approvals, and we could be subject to enforcement actions, fines, penalties, and litigation if we are found to violate any of these requirements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to (or decide to) continue to apply for or obtain any licenses, renewals, certifications, and approvals in any jurisdiction. In certain markets, we may need to rely on local banks or other partners to process payments and conduct foreign currency exchange transactions in local currency, and local regulators may use their authority over such local partners to prohibit, restrict, or limit us from doing business. Any of the foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate, result in substantial additional costs, delay or preclude planned transactions, geographical expansions, or product launches or improvements, require significant and costly operational changes, impose restrictions, limitations, or additional requirements on our business, products and services, or prevent or limit us from providing our products or services in a given market.\n\n## Cryptocurrency Regulation and Related Risks\n\nOur customer cryptocurrency offerings could subject us to additional regulations, licensing requirements, or other obligations or liabilities. Within the U.S., we are regulated by the New Y ork State Department of Financial Services as a virtual currency business, which does not qualify us to engage in securities brokerage or dealing activities. The regulatory status of particular cryptocurrencies is unclear under ex isting law . For ex ample, if the Securities and Ex change Commission ('SEC') were to assert that any of the cryptocurrencies we support are securities, the SEC could assert that our activities involving that cryptocurrency require securities broker-dealer registration or other obligations under the federal securities laws.

      "answer": "AIG's financial performance decline risk is directly tied to its remaining investment in Corebridge, where a decline in the market value of Corebridge common stock affects AIG's net investment income due to its fair value accounting treatment. This exposure could result in material adverse effects on AIG\u2019s results and financial condition. Specifically, AIG notes that adverse movements in Corebridge\u2019s stock price prior to or at the time of further sales could prevent AIG from realizing the expected benefits of its divestment. Meanwhile, PYPL faces financial performance decline risk due to its $2.6 billion in unrecognized tax benefits, which could negatively impact liquidity, access to capital, and borrowing costs, especially if legal or regulatory proceedings result in fines, penalties, or restitution. These two exposures illustrate how both companies face financial risks tied to external uncertainties\u2014one tied to equity market exposure and the other to regulatory and legal liabilities.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, AIG continues to hold a significant stake in Corebridge and accounts for it using the fair value option, meaning changes in stock price directly impact investment income.

        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, PYPL has $2.6 billion in unrecognized tax benefits, which could lead to liquidity issues and negatively impact financial performance if legal or regulatory proceedings result in financial penalties.",

There can be no assurances that the anticipated benefits of our sales of Corebridge stock will be achieved.\n\nSince September of 2022 when we closed on the initial public offering of Corebridge's common stock, we have continued to sell down our interest in Corebridge. On June 9, 2024, we met the requirements for the deconsolidation of Corebridge for accounting purposes. For a detailed discussion of the deconsolidation, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nAlthough Corebridge has been deconsolidated from our consolidated financial results, we continue to hold a significant stake in Corebridge's common stock. A t the time of deconsolidation, we elected the fair value option to account for our remaining investment in Corebridge. From that date onward, the fair value change in Corebridge's stock, and dividends received from Corebridge, are recognized in net investment income. A s a result, a decline in the market value of Corebridge common stock may result in a decrease in our investment income and may have a material and adverse effect on our results and financial condition. There can be no assurances given as to the price, transaction costs, or timing of further Corebridge stock sales and, as a result, we may fail to realize the expected benefits of our sales of such stock if there are adverse movements in its market value prior to, or at the time of, such sales.\n\nFurther, the sale of our remaining Corebridge stock involves a number of divestment-related risks, including (i) unanticipated developments that may delay, prevent or otherwise adversely affect our ability to continue the full divestment, including an economic downturn or unfavorable capital markets conditions; (ii) unforeseen losses, liabilities or asset impairments arising from further dispositions; and (iii) challenges associated with the valuation of Corebridge and the Company as we seek to fully divest our investment in Corebridge.\n\nIn addition, the div estment of Corebridge, or a significant delay in our ability to continue to sell our Corebridge stock, has caused and could continue to cause the emergence, or exacerbate the effects of, many of the other risks discussed herein, including changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize certain tax loss and credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income.\n\nSignificant legal or regulatory proceedings may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\n\nIn the normal course of business, we face significant risk from regulatory and governmental investigations and civil actions, litigation and other forms of dispute resolution in various domestic and foreign jurisdictions. We frequently engage in litigation and arbitration concerning the scope of coverage under insurance and reinsurance contracts, and face litigation and arbitration in which our subsidiaries defend or indemnify their insureds under insurance contracts.\n\nAdditionally, from time to time, various regulatory and governmental agencies review the transactions and practices of the Company and our subsidiaries in connection with company-specific matters, or industry-wide and other inquiries into, among other matters, the business practices of current and former operating insurance subsidiaries. Such reviews, investigations, inquiries or examinations have and could lead to extended delays to, or prohibitions of, such transactions or practices, or develop into administrative, civil or criminal proceedings or enforcement actions, in which remedies could include fines, penalties, restitution or alterations to our business practices, and could result in additional expenses, limitations on certain business activities and reputational damage.\n\nWe, our subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors are also subject to, or may become subject to, a variety of additional types of legal disputes brought by holders of our securities, customers, employees and others, alleging, among other things, breach of contractual or fiduciary duties, bad faith, indemnification and violations of federal and state statutes and regulations. Certain of these matters may also involve potentially significant risk of loss due to the possibility of significant jury awards and settlements, punitive damages or other penalties. M any of these matters are also highly complex and seek recovery on behalf of a class or similarly large number of plaintiffs. It is therefore inherently  difficult to predict the siz e or scope of potential future losses arising from them, and dev elopments in these matters could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations.\n\nFor information regarding certain legal proceedings, see Notes 15 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIncreasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from investors, customers, regulators, policymakers and other stakeholders regarding environmental, social, governance and sustainability matters, including governmental responses to such matters, may adversely affect our reputation or otherwise adversely impact our business and results of operations.\n\nThere is increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from investors, customers, regulators, policymakers and other stakeholders on companies' governance, risk oversight, disclosures, plans, policies and practices regarding environmental, social, governance and sustainability matters, including those related to environmental stewardship, climate change, racial justice and workplace conduct. The requirements, standards and expectations of such stakeholders may also, as a whole, reflect diverging or conflicting values or policy objectives.\n\nGovernmental actions to mitigate climate and other risks related to environmental, social, governance and sustainability matters, or, conversely, to restrict actions companies may take in response to such risks, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Internationally and at the U.S. federal, state and local levels, regulators have imposed and likely will continue to impose requirements and guidance related to environmental, social, governance and sustainability matters, which will continue to\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n\n25",

While proposed regulations were issued in Q3 2024, uncertainties remain regarding their full financial impact, which affects AIG\u2019s financial planning and capital allocation. Additionally, potential global tax regime changes proposed by the OECD could increase AIG\u2019s global tax costs, further influencing its capital strategy. On the other hand, PayPal faces regulatory scrutiny across multiple jurisdictions due to its international lending products. Its U.S. and European consumer and merchant lending products are subject to varying federal, state, and local laws, including consumer protection, AML, and data privacy regulations.

Changes in legislation or regulation could also impose additional taxes on a limited subset of financial institutions and insurance companies (either based on size, activities, geography or other criteria), limit our ability to engage in capital or liability management, require us to raise additional capital, and impose burdensome requirements and additional costs. It is uncertain whether and how these and other changes in legislation or regulation would apply to us, those who sell or service our products, or our competitors or how they could impact our ability to compete effectively, as well as our business, consolidated results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\n\n## An 'ownership change' could limit our ability to utilize tax loss and credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income.\n\nOur ability to use U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if we experience an 'ownership change' as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. In general, an ownership change will occur when the percentage of A IG Parent's ownership (measured by value) by one or more '5-percent shareholders' (as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code) has increased by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage owned by such shareholders at any time during the prior three years (calculated on a rolling basis). A n entity that experiences an ownership change generally will be subject to an annual limitation on its utiliz ation of pre-ownership change tax loss and credit carryforwards equal to the equity value of the corporation immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate posted monthly by the Internal Revenue Service (A FR) (subject to certain adjustments). The annual limitation would be increased each year to the extent that there is an unused limitation in a prior year. The limitation on our ability to utilize tax loss and credit carryforwards arising from an ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code would be dependent on the value of our equity and the AFR at the time of any ownership change. If we were to experience an 'ownership change,' it is possible that a significant portion of our tax loss carryforwards could expire before we would be able to use them to offset future taxable income.\n\nNew and proposed changes to tax laws could increase our corporate taxes.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction A ct of 2022 includes a 15 percent corporate alternative minimum tax (CA M T) on adjusted financial statement income for corporations with average profits over $1 billion over a three-year period. While the U.S. Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service issued proposed regulations for CA M T during the third quarter of 2024, there are still certain details regarding the application of the CA M T that remain unclear and we continue to evaluate the impact of the proposed regulations along with any other guidance.\n\nNew tax laws outside the U.S., in particular those enacted in response to proposals by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, could make substantive changes to the global international tax regime. Such changes could increase our global tax costs. We continue to monitor and assess the impact of such proposals.\n\nFinally, it is possible that tax  laws will be further changed either in a technical corrections bill or entirely  new legislation. It remains difficult to predict whether or when there will be any tax law changes or further guidance by the authorities in the U.S. or elsewhere in the world. New or proposed changes to tax laws may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, as the impact of proposals on our business can vary substantially depending upon the specific changes or further guidance made and how the changes or guidance are implemented by the authorities.\n\nFor additional information, see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n28\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOur U.S. consumer interest-bearing installment product is subject to federal and state laws and is offered by an independent chartered financial institution. PayPal's interest-bearing installment product for consumers in G ermany is subject to applicable local laws such as consumer (lending) laws, consumer protection, or banking transparency regulations. These loans are originated by PayPal (Europe).\n\nPayPal and V enmo co-branded consumer credit cards and the PayPal Credit revolving consumer credit product are issued by an independent chartered financial institution in the U.S., and are subject to laws and regulations governing these programs. PayPal Credit in the U.K. is a regulated, revolving consumer credit product subject to applicable local laws and regulations.\n\nOur U.S. merchant lending products are subject to federal and state regulations and are offered by an independent chartered financial institution. Our merchant lending products offered in G ermany, France, and the Netherlands are subject to the laws of Luxembourg and certain local laws, and our merchant lending product offered in the U.K. is subject to U.K. regulation. The loans offered to European and U.K. merchants are originated by PayPal (Europe) and PayPal U.K., respectively. Our merchant lending product in Australia is subject to the laws of Australia and is originated by PayPal Credit Pty Limited.\n\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau ('CFPB'). The CFPB has significant authority to regulate consumer financial products in the U.S., including consumer credit, deposits, payments, and similar products. As a large market participant of remittance transfers, we are subject to the direct supervisory authority of the CFPB. The  CFPB  and  similar  regulatory  agencies  in  other  jurisdictions  may  have  broad  consumer  protection  mandates  that  could  result  in  the  promulgation  and interpretation of rules and regulations that may materially impact our business.\n\nAnti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, and sanctions. PayPal is subject to anti-money laundering ('AML') laws and regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, as well as laws designed to prevent the use of the financial systems to facilitate terrorist activities. Our AML program is designed to prevent our payments platform from being used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit activities, or to do business in countries or with persons and entities included on designated country or person lists promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Controls and equivalent authorities in other countries. Our AML and sanctions compliance programs, overseen by our AML/Bank Secrecy Act Officer, are composed of policies, procedures, and internal controls, and are designed to address these legal and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks.\n\nInterchange fees. Interchange fees (the transaction fees for processing credit and debit card transactions) are subject to regulation in certain jurisdictions.  For example, in the EU, the Multilateral Interchange Fee Regulation caps interchange fees and provides for business rules to be complied with by any company dealing with payment card transactions. Interchange fees are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions. As a result, the fees that we collect in certain jurisdictions may become the subject of regulatory challenge.\n\nData protection and privacy. We are subject to a number of laws, rules, directives, and regulations ('privacy and data protection laws') relating to the collection, use, retention, security, processing, and transfer (collectively, 'processing') of personally identifiable information about our customers, our merchants' customers, and employees ('personal data') in the countries where we operate. Our business relies on the processing of personal data in many jurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders. As a result, much of the personal data that we process, which may include certain financial information associated with individuals, is subject to one or more privacy and data protection laws in one or more jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between or among us, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercial relationships.\n\nRegulatory scrutiny of privacy, data protection, cybersecurity practices, and the processing of personal data is increasing around the world. Regulatory authorities are continuously considering numerous legislative and regulatory proposals and interpretive guidelines that may contain additional privacy and data protection obligations. Many jurisdictions in which we operate have adopted, or are in the process of adopting or amending data protection and privacy legislation or regulation aimed at creating and enhancing individual privacy rights and data protection obligations. In addition, the interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere are subject to change and may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny and business costs.\n\nAnti-corruption. PayPal is subject to applicable anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Anti-corruption laws generally prohibit offering, promising, giving, accepting, or authorizing others to provide anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to or from a government official or private party to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage, such as to obtain or retain business. We have implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with these laws and regulations.",

      "question": "How do the regulatory requirements imposed on AIG's insurance subsidiaries and PayPal's financial services operations differ in terms of oversight focus and compliance obligations under Financial Services Regulations?",
      "answer": "AIG's insurance subsidiaries are primarily regulated based on financial condition, corporate conduct, and market conduct, with oversight including approval of policy language, advertising practices, minimum capital and liquidity requirements, investment restrictions, and enterprise risk management. These regulations are aimed at protecting policyholders and involve extensive reporting and approval processes for transactions with affiliates and dividend distributions. In contrast, PayPal is subject to financial services regulations focused on payments, consumer protection, anti-money laundering, cybersecurity, and capitalization standards, with specific licensing obligations as a money transmitter and credit institution in various jurisdictions. PayPal must comply with rules related to customer fund handling, transaction reporting, and periodic inspections by multiple international regulatory bodies such as the CSSF in Luxembourg and the FCA in the UK. These differing regulatory foci reflect the distinct nature of their financial services operations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - AIG's regulatory oversight includes financial condition, market conduct, corporate conduct, and enterprise risk management, with specific controls on policy language approval, investment practices, and affiliate transactions.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - PayPal is regulated under financial services laws covering payments, consumer protection, anti-money laundering, and cybersecurity, with licensing obligations in multiple jurisdictions including the U.S., EU, and UK.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are subject to Financial Services Regulations, but the nature of their operations leads to distinct regulatory focuses: AIG is centered on insurance policyholder protection, while PayPal's compliance obligations emphasize payment systems, consumer rights, and international financial supervision."

We believe in building a culture where everyone is valued and where all perspectives are welcome.\n\n## Regulation\n\n## GENERAL\n\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which our insurance businesses are located or operate. Insurance regulatory authorities in those jurisdictions are the primary regulators for those businesses; however, our operations are subject to regulation by many different types of regulatory authorities, including insurance, securities and derivatives regulators in the United States and abroad.\n\nInsurance regulators, other regulatory authorities, law enforcement agencies, and other governmental authorities from time to time make inquiries and conduct examinations or investigations regarding our compliance, as well as compliance by other companies in our industry, with applicable laws. In addition, regulation, legislation and administrative policies that are not limited in application solely to the insurance market may significantly affect the insurance industry and certain of our operations, including regulation, legislation and administrative policies related to privacy, cybersecurity, government sanctions, anti-discrimination, financial services, securities, taxation and climate change. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Regulation - \"Our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in laws and regulations may affect our operations, increase our insurance subsidiary capital requirements or reduce our profitability\" .\n\nWe expect that the U.S. and international regulations applicable to us and our regulated entities will continue to evolve for the foreseeable future. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Regulation - \"New laws and regulations or new interpretations of current laws and regulations, both domestically and internationally, may affect our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and ability to compete effectively\" .\n\n## FINANCIAL, MARKET CONDUCT &amp; CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERSIGHT\n\nThe method of insurance regulation of our insurance subsidiaries varies, but generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory and supervisory powers to a state insurance official (in the United States) or another governmental agency (outside the United States). The regulation and supervision relate primarily to the financial condition of the insurers, corporate conduct and market conduct activities. In general, such regulation is for the protection of policyholders rather than the creditors or equity owners of these companies. Financial, market conduct and corporate conduct oversight varies by jurisdiction, but can include activities such as:\n\n(a)approval of policy language and rates;\n\n(b)advertising practices;\n\n(c)establishing minimum capital and liquidity requirements;\n\n(d)licensing of insurers and their agents;\n\n(e)requiring registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies that are licensed in the jurisdiction;\n\n- (f) evaluating and, in some cases, requiring regulatory approval of, certain transactions between insurance company subsidiaries and their affiliates;\n\n(g)imposing restrictions and limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions payable by an insurance company;\n\n(h)enforcing rules related to outsourcing of material functions;\n\n- (i) requiring deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders;\n- (j) establishing requirements for acceptability of reinsurers and credit for reinsurance;\n- (k)establishing requirements for reserves; and\n- (l) enterprise risk management (including technology risk management) and corporate governance requirements.\n\nOur insurance subsidiaries are generally subject to laws and regulations that prescribe the type, quality and concentration of investments they can make and permissible investment practices, such as derivatives, securities lending and repurchase transactions. In non-U.S. jurisdictions, our insurance subsidiaries may also be subject to laws requiring certain amounts and types of local investment.\n\nInsurance laws in many jurisdictions also provide that no person, corporation or other entity may acquire control of an insurance company, or a controlling interest in (or prescribed percentage of capital of) any direct or indirect parent company of an insurance company, without the prior approval of, or notice to, such insurance company's domiciliary insurance regulator.\n\n6\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GOVERNMENT REGULATION\n\nWe operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened focus by regulators globally on all aspects of the payments industry, including anti-money laundering, countering terrorist financing, privacy, cybersecurity, and consumer protection. The laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital payments, continue to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. New or changing laws and regulations, including changes to their interpretation and implementation, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to noncompliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We monitor these areas closely and are focused on designing compliant solutions for our customers.\n\nGovernment regulation impacts key aspects of our business. We are subject to the laws and regulations applicable to the payments industry in the markets we operate, which are subject to interpretation and change.\n\nPayments regulation. Various  laws  and  regulations  govern  the  payments  industry  in  the  U.S.  and  internationally.  In  the  U.S.,  PayPal,  Inc.  (a  wholly-owned subsidiary) holds licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in the states where such licenses are required, as well as in the District of Columbia and certain territories. These licenses include not only our PayPal-branded products and services, but also our V enmo, Hyperwallet, Xoom, and Zettle products and services, to the ex tent offered in these locations. As a licensed money transmitter, PayPal is subject to, among other requirements, restrictions on the investment of customer funds, reporting requirements, bonding requirements, and inspection by state regulatory agencies. In certain cases, these licenses also generally cover PayPal's service enabling customers to buy, hold, transfer, and sell cryptocurrency directly from their PayPal or V enmo account. In the State of New Y ork, PayPal holds a full Bitlicense issued by the New York Department of Financial Services to offer cryptocurrency services in the state.\n\nOutside the U.S., we provide similar services customized for various countries and foreign jurisdictions through our foreign subsidiaries. The activities of those nonU.S.  entities  are,  or  may  be,  supervised  by  a  financial  regulatory  authority  in  the  jurisdictions  in  which  they  operate. Among  other  regulatory  authorities,  the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the 'CSSF'), the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority ('FCA'), the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, the People's Bank of China, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Reserve Bank of India, and the Central Bank of Brazil have asserted jurisdiction over some or all of our activities in their respective jurisdictions. This list is not ex haustive, and there are numerous other regulatory agencies that have asserted or may assert jurisdiction over our activities.\n\nIn  addition,  financial  services  regulators  in  various  jurisdictions,  including  the  U.S.  and  the  European  Union  ('EU'),  have  implemented  payment  authentication requirements for banks and payment processors intended to reduce online fraud, which could impose significant costs, make it more difficult for new customers to open PayPal accounts, and reduce the ease of use of our products.\n\nFinancial Services supervision . We serve our customers in the EU through PayPal (Europe) S.\u00e0.r.l. et Cie, S.C.A. ('PayPal (Europe)'), a wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a credit institution in Lux embourg by the CSSF. We serve our customers in the U.K. through PayPal U.K. Limited ('PayPal U.K.'), a wholly-owned subsidiary that is subject to regulation as an electronic money institution in the U.K. by the FCA. Accordingly, we must comply with rules and regulations applicable to electronic money institutions in the U.K. and credit institutions in the E.U., including those related to capitalization, funds management, corporate  governance,  anti-money  laundering,  consumer  rights,  disclosure,  reporting,  and  inspection.  We  are,  or  may  be,  subject  to  financial  services-related regulations in other countries now or in the future related to our role in the financial services industry. In addition, based on our relationships with our partner financial institutions, we are, or may be, subject to indirect regulation and ex amination by the regulators of these partner financial institutions.\n\nLending regulation .  Our  U.S.  consumer  short-term,  interest-free,  installment  product  is  subject  to  federal  and  state  laws  governing  consumer  credit  and  debt collection, and PayPal holds multiple state licenses as the lender for this product. In Australia, PayPal Credit Pty Limited offers a consumer short-term, interest-free, installment product that is exempt from regulation by the primary consumer credit legislation, but is subject to other laws which cover the provision of financial services, credit reporting, debt collection, and privacy. PayPal's consumer short-term, interest-free, installment products in the U.K., France, G ermany, Spain, and Italy are generally exempt from primary consumer credit legislation; however, certain consumer lending laws, consumer protection, and banking transparency regulations apply to this activity.  Paidy,  Inc.  holds  multiple  licenses  for  the  issuance  of  its  consumer  installment  products  in  Japan  and  is  registered  with  the  Ministry  of Economy, Trade and Industry as a Comprehensive Credit Purchase Intermediary.\n\n10",

      "answer": "AIG's $492 million in commercial mortgage loans on nonaccrual status indicates loans where interest income is no longer accrued due to concerns about collectability. In contrast, Morgan Stanley references distressed debt positions in its portfolio that were purchased at amounts well below par, suggesting these are acquired loans where the contractual principal exceeds fair value, often due to credit deterioration. While AIG's nonaccrual loans represent internal credit risk on originated assets, Morgan Stanley's distressed debt positions reflect strategic purchases of below-par loans, likely with the expectation of recovery or gain.",

        "Step 1: From AIG's 2023 10-K, extract the specific figure of $492 million in commercial mortgage loans on nonaccrual status as of December 31, 2023.",
        "Step 2: From Morgan Stanley's 2023 10-K, extract the disclosure that a majority of the difference between principal and fair value for loans relates to distressed debt positions purchased at amounts well below par.",
        "Step 3: Compare the two figures, noting that AIG's nonaccrual status reflects credit impairment on originated loans, whereas Morgan Stanley's distressed debt positions are acquired at a discount, indicating different underlying financial strategies and risk profiles."

      "question": "How might AIG's reliance on reinsurance to manage single risk loss exposure potentially intersect with Morgan Stanley's credit risk exposure through derivatives and lending to financial institutions?",
      "answer": "AIG manages single risk loss exposure through a combination of internal underwriting standards and external reinsurance, ensuring that the net risk remains within acceptable limits set by the Chief Underwriting Officer. Morgan Stanley, on the other hand, incurs credit risk through a variety of activities, including derivative contracts where counterparties may fail to meet financial obligations, and through secured and unsecured lending to financial institutions. If any of AIG\u2019s reinsurers were to experience financial distress due to a major loss event or market downturn, this could impact their ability to meet reinsurance obligations to AIG. Given Morgan Stanley\u2019s exposure to financial institutions through derivatives and lending, a credit event involving a reinsurer that is also a counterparty or borrower with Morgan Stanley could create a shared risk concentration, amplifying the impact on both firms. This intersection would occur through overlapping counterparty credit risk, particularly if reinsurers are leveraged or have significant exposure to similar macroeconomic or market risks.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AIG manages single risk loss exposure using internal underwriting standards and external reinsurance, with net risk kept within limits set by the Chief Underwriting Officer.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Morgan Stanley incurs credit risk through derivative contracts and secured/unsecured lending to financial institutions, including those that may be counterparties in the reinsurance market.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - AIG\u2019s reliance on reinsurance introduces counterparty credit risk, which could intersect with Morgan Stanley\u2019s credit exposure if reinsurers are also Morgan Stanley counterparties or borrowers. A credit event affecting a reinsurer could thus impact both firms through shared counterparty risk."

      "answer": "AIG manages catastrophe exposure through a combination of internal underwriting standards, reinsurance, and modeling techniques to ensure net risk remains within acceptable limits set by the Chief Underwriting Officer. This includes monitoring geographic and industry-specific risk concentrations and using reinsurance to limit potential losses. In contrast, Morgan Stanley employs a risk limits framework tied to its capital planning process, which includes stress testing under a Severely Adverse scenario to estimate losses and size its risk-taking capacity. While AIG focuses on risk transfer and exposure limitation through insurance mechanisms, Morgan Stanley emphasizes quantitative risk limits, scenario analysis, and transparency of material market risks through its Market Risk Department.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AIG uses reinsurance and underwriting controls to manage catastrophe exposure and sets limits through the Chief Underwriting Officer.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Morgan Stanley uses a risk limits framework linked to capital planning and stress tests under a Severely Adverse scenario to manage concentrated risks.",

      "answer": "AIG estimates the fair value of 'securities sold but not yet purchased' based on current market prices when available, but does not specify alternative valuation techniques in the provided excerpt. In contrast, Schwab uses quoted market prices or other observable market data and obtains prices from three independent third-party pricing services when quoted prices in active markets do not exist. Schwab compares these prices to ensure reasonableness and does not adjust them unless they are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in material differences.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From AIG's 10-K, we learn that they measure 'securities sold but not yet purchased' at fair value, with fair values based on current market prices, but no alternative methodology is described in the excerpt.",
        "Step 2: From Schwab's 10-K, we see that they use quoted market prices or observable market data for valuing 'securities sold but not yet purchased' and employ multiple third-party pricing services to validate the reasonableness of these values.",
        "Step 3: The synthesis reveals that while both companies report the same type of liability, Schwab provides a more detailed and diversified methodology for valuation when active market prices are not available, whereas AIG's approach in this excerpt is less elaborated."

Fair Value Measurements\n\nWe value our super senior credit default swap portfolio using prices obtained from vendors and/or counterparties. The valuation of the super senior credit derivatives is complex because of the limited availability of market observable information due to the lack of trading and price transparency in certain structured finance markets. Our valuation methodologies for the super senior CDS portfolio have evolved over time in response to market conditions and the availability of market observable information. We have sought to calibrate the methodologies to available market information and to review the assumptions of the methodologies on a regular basis.\n\n## Fortitude Re funds withheld payable\n\nThe reinsurance transactions between AIG and Fortitude Re were structured as modco and loss portfolio transfer arrangements with funds withheld (funds withheld). AIG has established a funds withheld payable to Fortitude Re while simultaneously establishing a reinsurance asset representing reserves for the insurance coverage that Fortitude Re has assumed. The funds withheld payable contains an embedded derivative and changes in fair value of the embedded derivative related to the funds withheld payable are recognized in earnings through realized gains (losses). This embedded derivative is considered a total return swap with contractual returns that are attributable to v arious assets and liabilities associated with these reinsurance agreements.\n\n## Other Liabilities\n\nOther liabilities measured at fair value include certain securities sold under agreements to repurchase and certain securities sold but not yet purchased. Liabilities arising from securities sold under agreements to repurchase are generally treated as collateralized borrowings. We estimate the fair value of liabilities arising under these agreements by using market-observable interest rates. This methodology considers such factors as the coupon rate, yield curves and other relevant factors. Fair values for securities sold but not yet purchased are based on current market prices.\n\n## ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS\n\nThe following table presents information about assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and indicates the level of the fair value measurement based on the observability of the inputs used:\n\n",

Quoted prices for investments in exchange-traded securities represent end-of-day close prices published by exchanges. Quoted prices for money market funds and other mutual funds represent reported net asset values. When utilizing market data and bid-ask spread, the Company uses the price within the bid-ask spread that best represents fair value. When quoted prices in active markets do not exist, the Company uses prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets, and we generally obtain prices from three independent third-party pricing sources for such assets recorded at fair value.\n\nOur primary independent pricing service provides prices for our fixed income investments such as commercial paper; certificates of deposit; U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; corporate debt securities; asset-backed securities; foreign government agency securities; and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. Such prices are based on observable trades, broker/dealer quotes, and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities (a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads) and weighted-average maturity for the same or similar 'to-be-issued' securities. We compare the prices obtained from the primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable. Schwab does not adjust the prices received from independent third-party pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in material differences in the amounts recorded.\n\nLiabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include interest rate swaps, securities sold but not yet purchased, and repurchase liabilities related to client-held fractional shares of equities, ETFs, and other securities, which are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets (see Other securities owned and securities sold but not yet purchased above in this Note 2 for the treatment of client-held fractional shares). The fair values of securities sold but not yet purchased are based on quoted market prices or other observable market data. The Company has elected the fair value option pursuant to ASC 825 Financial Instruments for the repurchase liabilities to match the measurement and accounting of the related client-held fractional shares. The fair values of the repurchase liabilities are based on quoted market prices or other observable market data consistent with the related client-held fractional shares. Unrealized gains and losses on client-held fractional shares offset the unrealized gains and losses on the corresponding repurchase liabilities, resulting in no impact to the consolidated statements of income. The Company's liabilities to repurchase client-held fractional shares do not have credit risk, and, as a result, the Company has not recognized any gains or losses in the consolidated statements of income or comprehensive income attributable to instrument-specific credit risk for these repurchase liabilities. The repurchase liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nThe fair values of interest rate swaps are based on market observable interest rate yield curves. Fair value measurements are priced considering the coupon rate of the fix ed leg of the contract and the variable coupon rate on the floating leg of the contract. V aluation is based on both spot and forward rates on the swap yield curve. The Company validates its valuations with counterparty quotations from central counterparty (CCP) clearing houses. See Note 17 for additional information on the Company's interest rate swaps.",

      "answer": "AIG increased its credit facility commitments to $4.5 billion (from $3.0 billion) through an amended credit agreement in September 2024, providing greater liquidity flexibility for general corporate purposes. Additionally, AIG issued approximately $660 million in new debt across three note tranches while redeeming and repurchasing $2.0 billion in existing notes, resulting in a $14 million loss on extinguishment. This reflects a strategy of actively managing debt structure and maintaining liquidity headroom. In contrast, Schwab manages its credit lines\u2014particularly for its Portfolio Advantage Loans (PALs)\u2014by requiring over-collateralization, daily monitoring of collateral values, and automatic adjustments (e.g., liquidation or credit line reductions) to limit credit loss exposure. Schwab\u2019s allowance for credit losses is based on collateral maintenance provisions and statistical modeling, reflecting a risk mitigation strategy focused on asset-backed security and proactive risk control rather than liquidity expansion.",

          "chunk_text": "## THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per S hare Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\n\ntransactions are included in receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations on the consolidated balance sheets. For securities loaned, Schwab typically receives collateral in the form of cash in an amount equal to or greater than the market value of securities loaned; the payables from these transactions are included in payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations on the consolidated balance sheets. In instances where the Company is acting as the lender and receives securities that can be sold or pledged as collateral, the Company recognizes the collateral received at fair value and the obligation to return the collateral in the consolidated balance sheets. The market value of securities borrowed and loaned is monitored and collateral is adjusted to ensure full collateralization. Fees received or paid are recorded in interest revenue or interest ex pense. Schwab applies the practical ex pedient based on collateral maintenance provisions in estimating an allowance for credit losses for securities borrowed receivables.\n\n## Bank loans and related allowance for loan losses\n\nBank loans held for investments are recorded at amortized cost, which is comprised of the contractual principal amounts adjusted for unamortized direct origination costs or net purchase discounts or premiums. Interest income on bank loans is recognized using the effective interest method based on the contractual terms of the loan. Direct origination costs and premiums and discounts are recognized in interest revenue using the effective interest method over the contractual life of the loan and are adjusted for actual prepayments. Additionally, management estimates an allowance for credit losses, which is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to arrive at the amount expected to be collected. The bank loan portfolio includes three portfolio segments: residential real estate, PALs, and other loans. We use these segments when developing and documenting our methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses. The residential real estate portfolio segment is divided into two classes of financing receivables for purposes of monitoring and assessing credit risk: First Mortgages and HELOCs.\n\nSchwab records an allowance for credit losses through a charge to provision for credit losses, included in other revenue, based on our estimate of current expected credit losses for the ex isting portfolio. We review the allowance for credit losses quarterly, taking into consideration current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, the composition of the existing loan portfolio, past loss ex perience, and any other risks inherent in the portfolio to ensure that the allowance for credit losses is maintained at an appropriate level.\n\nSubstantially all PALs are collateralized by marketable securities with liquid markets. Credit lines are over-collateralized and borrowers are required to maintain collateral at specified levels at all times. The required collateral levels are determined based on the type of security pledged. Additionally, collateral market value is monitored on a daily basis and a borrower's credit line may be reduced or collateral may be liquidated if the collateral is in danger of falling below specified levels. As such, the credit loss inherent within this portfolio is limited. Schwab applies the practical ex pedient based on collateral maintenance provisions in estimating an allowance for credit losses for PALs.\n\nThe methodology to establish an allowance for credit losses for the residential real estate portfolio segment utilizes statistical models that estimate prepayments, defaults, and expected losses for this portfolio segment based on predicted behavior of individual loans within the segment. The methodology also evaluates concentrations in the classes of financing receivables, including loan products within those classes, year of origination, and geographical distribution of collateral.\n\nExpected credit losses are estimated using a loan-level model that projects each loan's behavior over its term based on forecasted voluntary housing turnover, the rates of refinancing, delinquency transition rates, and severity of loss. The model takes into account the current relevant risk indicators, including each loan's term and structure, current delinquency status, and the estimated current LTV ratio, as well as borrower FICO scores and current key interest rates including U.S. Treasury, SOFR, Prime, and mortgage rates. The more significant variables in the model include delinquency roll rates, housing prices, interest rates, and the unemployment rate. Delinquency roll rates (i.e., the rates at which loans transition through delinquency stages and ultimately result in a loss) are estimated from our historical loss ex perience over a full economic cycle. Loss severity (i.e., loss given default) estimates are based on forecasted net equity associated with each loan and property, as well as loss ex perience and market trends, both current and forecasted. Housing price trends are derived from historical home price indices and econometric forecasts of future home values. Factors affecting the home price index include housing inventory, unemployment, interest rates, and inflation expectations. Mortgage rates are estimated based on forecasted spread, while the rest of the interest rates used by the model are projected based on the forward rates. The unemployment rate forecast is typically based on the recent consensus of regularly published economic surveys. Linear interpolation is applied to revert to long-term trends after the reasonable and supportable forecast period.\n\nThe methodology described above results in loss factors that are applied to the amortized cost basis of loans, exclusive of accrued interest receivable, to determine the allowance for credit losses for First Mortgages and HELOCs.",

      "question": "Given AIG's $4,116 million exposure to Other Financial Institutions in 2024 and Schwab's disclosure that problems at such institutions could increase FDIC premiums, how might financial sector instability impact Schwab's profitability?",
      "answer": "AIG\u2019s significant exposure of $4,116 million to Other Financial Institutions in 2024 indicates a material connection to the broader financial sector. Schwab explicitly states that financial sector instability, such as the failure of other institutions, could lead to increased FDIC premiums and special assessments. Higher FDIC premiums would directly reduce Schwab\u2019s profitability by increasing operating costs. Additionally, financial sector instability could trigger client reallocation away from deposit accounts, reducing Schwab\u2019s fee revenue and increasing liquidity risk. Therefore, instability in the financial sector\u2014amplified by broad exposures like AIG\u2019s\u2014could negatively affect Schwab\u2019s profitability through both regulatory cost increases and client behavior shifts.",

        "Step 2: Extract from Schwab\u2019s 2024 10-K - Schwab discloses that problems at other financial institutions could lead to increased FDIC premiums and negatively affect profitability.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - AIG\u2019s exposure suggests vulnerability in the financial system, which if triggered, could lead to failures or instability. This would cause regulatory responses like higher FDIC premiums, which Schwab states would directly reduce its profitability."

Increased unrealized losses on investment securities or other assets on our balance sheet can reduce market or client confidence in us, which could limit our ability to attract new client assets and accounts or result in the transfer of client assets and accounts from the Company.\n\nA rise in interest rates may also reduce our bank deposit account fee revenue, as clients may reallocate assets out of bank deposit account balances and into higheryielding investment alternatives, as we experienced in recent years. The 2023 IDA agreement involves certain commitments, including the maintenance of prescribed minimum and maximum insured deposit account balances (IDA balances), that limit our ability to respond to changes in interest rates and may impact our profitability and bank deposit account fee revenue. The bank deposit account fee revenue that we earn related to the IDA agreement may be less than the net interest revenue that we could have earned if the deposit balances were swept to our banking subsidiaries rather than the TD Depository Institutions. When we are permitted to reduce the IDA balances, we can only move the balances to our banking subsidiaries if we have sufficient capital.\n\nProblems encountered by other financial institutions and responsive measures to manage such problems could adversely affect financial markets generally, could have an adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations, and have indirect adverse effects on us.\n\nConcerns regarding the soundness or creditworthiness of other financial institutions can cause substantial disruption within the financial markets and have negative impacts for us and our industry, including reductions in availability of liquidity, higher borrowing costs, and higher costs of capital. Such concerns regarding one or more financial institutions may also advance public concerns regarding Schwab or the financial services industry more broadly, which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, even if underlying matters impacting other financial institutions are of limited or no direct applicability to us. Financial institutions are interrelated through trading, clearing, or other relationships, and, as a result, concerns about the financial condition of one or more institutions could lead to significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses, or defaults by other institutions. This risk may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as broker-dealers, banks, clearing houses, securities ex changes, market makers, and others, with which we interact on a daily basis, and therefore, could adversely affect us.\n\nEvents affecting the financial services industry may also result in potentially adverse changes to laws or regulations governing banks and savings and loan holding companies or result in the imposition of restrictions through supervisory or enforcement activities, including higher capital or liquidity requirements or increased FDIC premiums and special assessments, which could have a material impact on our business. Following the failure of several U.S. banks in 2023, the U.S. federal banking agencies proposed rules that would significantly impact our regulatory capital requirements, including requiring us to include AOCI in regulatory capital, as well as rules that would require minimum levels of eligible long-term debt at CSC and our banking subsidiaries. As a result of heightened regulatory focus on capital requirements, the Company took measures to increase its capital, including revising its long-term operating objective. In addition, the cost of resolving the 2023 bank failures resulted in increased FDIC costs and may prompt the FDIC to further increase its premiums or to issue additional special assessments, which could have a material negative impact on our profitability and our business.\n\n## Liquidity Risk\n\nA significant decrease in our liquidity could negatively affect our business as well as reduce client confidence in us.\n\nMaintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to our business operations, including transaction settlement, custody requirements, and lending commitments, among other liquidity needs. We meet our liquidity needs primarily from working capital and cash generated by client activity as well as external financing. Fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances, as well as market conditions or changes in regulatory treatment of client deposits, may affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs. While Schwab maintains diversified sources of funding, a reduction in our liquidity position could reduce client confidence in us, which could result in the transfer out of client assets and accounts, or could cause us to fail to satisfy our liquidity requirements, including the LCR. In addition, if our broker-dealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines, or if a depository institution subsidiary is unable to obtain regulatory approval, when required, to declare a dividend, regulators could limit the subsidiaries' ability to upstream funds to CSC or limit their operations, which could reduce CSC's liquidity and adversely affect its ability to repay debt, pay dividends on CSC's preferred stock and common stock, repurchase its shares, or redeem its preferred stock. In addition, CSC may need to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries.\n\nFactors which may adversely affect our liquidity position include CS&amp;Co having temporary liquidity demands due to timing differences between brokerage transaction settlements and the availability of segregated cash balances, fluctuations in cash held in banking or brokerage client accounts, such as the significant client reallocation from sweep cash to higher-yielding investments that we experienced in recent years in response to rapid interest rate increases, a dramatic increase in our lending",

In contrast, Bank of America recognizes tax credits from affordable housing investments ratably over up to 10 years, and for renewable energy investments, either at inception (for ITCs) or as energy is produced (for PTCs, generally over 10 years). This shows that while both companies benefit from tax credits, Schwab\u2019s 2023 effective rate was influenced by the immediate recognition of certain credits, whereas Bank of America spreads the benefit over a multi-year period depending on the investment type.",

      "question": "Given BAC's use of risk ratings to evaluate single-name credit concentration limits and SCHW's collateral maintenance provisions for securities borrowed receivables, how do these distinct approaches influence the calculation and allocation of credit loss reserves in each institution?",
      "answer": "BAC utilizes risk ratings as a factor in determining the level of allocated capital and the allowance for credit losses, particularly for commercial credit exposures that exceed single-name credit risk concentration guidelines. This approach directly ties risk ratings to capital allocation and loss provisioning for large corporate loans. In contrast, SCHW applies a practical expedient based on collateral maintenance provisions in estimating an allowance for credit losses for securities borrowed receivables, which are monitored daily to ensure full collateralization. This results in a different mechanism for credit loss reserve calculation that emphasizes over-collateralization requirements and daily market value monitoring rather than risk ratings. The two institutions thus use fundamentally different primary factors - BAC focuses on borrower risk ratings and concentration limits, while SCHW emphasizes collateral maintenance and market value adjustments - in determining how to allocate capital and establish credit loss reserves.",

      "question": "How does Citigroup's retention of servicing rights in U.S. agency-sponsored mortgage securitization trusts compare with PayPal's retention of servicing rights in its U.S. consumer installment loan program, and what are the implications for each company's balance sheet treatment?",
      "answer": "Citigroup retains servicing rights in U.S. agency-sponsored mortgage securitization trusts, which are classified as 'Other assets' on its consolidated balance sheet. These rights are part of a broader securitization process where Citigroup transfers mortgage loans to VIEs but retains certain interests, including MSRs (mortgage servicing rights). In contrast, PayPal retains servicing rights for the entire pool of consumer and merchant receivables in its U.S. installment loan program, for which it receives a market-based service fee. PayPal accounts for the asset transfer as a sale and derecognizes the portion of participation interests sold, while maintaining the servicing rights. The key difference lies in balance sheet treatment: Citigroup holds MSRs as part of its assets, whereas PayPal does not record the receivables on its consolidated financial statements because it does not hold an ownership interest in them, only the servicing rights.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From Citigroup's 10-K, we learn that it retains servicing rights in U.S. agency-sponsored mortgage securitization trusts, and these rights (MSRs) are included in 'Other assets' on the consolidated balance sheet.",
        "Step 2: From PayPal's 10-K, we see that PayPal retains servicing rights for the entire pool of consumer and merchant receivables and receives a service fee, but does not hold an ownership interest in the receivables, which are owned by a partner institution.",
        "Step 3: The comparison hinges on how each company treats the retained servicing rights on its balance sheet\u2014Citigroup includes MSRs as assets, while PayPal does not record the receivables at all, only servicing rights and fee income."

          "chunk_text": "## Mortgage Securitizations\n\nCitigroup provides a wide range of mortgage loan products to a diverse customer base that are securitized through the use of VIEs, which are funded through the issuance of trust certificates backed solely by the transferred assets. These certificates have the same life as the transferred assets. In addition to providing a source of liquidity and less ex pensive funding, securitizing these assets also reduces Citi's credit ex posure to the borrowers. These mortgage loan securitizations are primarily non-recourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchasers of the securities issued by the trust.\n\nCiti's U.S. consumer mortgage business generally retains the servicing rights and in certain instances retains investment securities, interest-only strips and residual interests in future cash flows from the trusts and also provides servicing for a limited number of Services , Markets and Banking securitizations. Citi's Services , Markets and Banking businesses may hold investment securities pursuant to credit risk retention rules or in connection with secondary market-making activities.\n\nmortgages) securitization. Citi is not the primary beneficiary of its U.S. agency-sponsored mortgage securitization entities because Citigroup does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the entities' economic performance. Therefore, Citi does not consolidate these U.S. agency-sponsored mortgage securitization entities. Substantially all of the consumer loans sold or securitized through non-consolidated trusts by Citigroup are U.S. prime residential mortgage loans. Retained interests in non-consolidated agency-sponsored mortgage securitization trusts are classified as Trading account assets , ex cept for MSRs, which are included in Other assets on Citigroup's Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nCitigroup does not consolidate certain non-agency-sponsored mortgage securitization entities because Citi is either not the servicer with the power to direct the significant activities of the entity or Citi is the servicer, but the servicing relationship is deemed to be a fiduciary relationship; therefore, Citi is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the entity.\n\nThe Company securitizes mortgage loans generally through either a U.S. governmentsponsored agency, such as Ginnie Mae, a U.S. agency-sponsored entity, such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, or a private label (non-agency-sponsored\n\nIn certain instances, the Company has (i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities' economic performance and (ii) the obligation to either absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to its non-agencysponsored mortgage securitization entities and, therefore, is the primary beneficiary and, thus, consolidates the VIE.\n\nThe following tables summarize selected cash flow information and retained interests related to Citigroup mortgage securitizations:\n\n",

The partner institution ex tends credit to consumers for interest-bearing installment products and to merchants for the PPWC and PPBL products, and we purchase the related receivables originated by the partner institution. In the U.S., we extend certain short-term, interest-free, installment loans to consumers through a U.S. subsidiary. For our international consumer credit products, we extend credit in the U.K and the rest of Europe through our U.K. subsidiary and Luxembourg banking subsidiary, respectively, and in Australia and Japan, through local subsidiaries. For our merchant finance products outside the U.S., we extend working capital advances and loans in the U.K. and rest of Europe through our U.K. subsidiary and Luxembourg banking subsidiary, respectively, and working capital loans in Australia through an Australian subsidiary.\n\nAs part of our arrangement with the partner institution in the U.S., we sell back a participation interest in the pool of receivables for the consumer interest-bearing installment products, PPWC, and PPBL. The partner institution has no recourse against us related to their participation interests for failure of debtors to pay when due. The participation interests held by the partner institution have the same priority to the interests held by us and are subject to the same credit, prepayment, and interest  rate  risk  associated  with  this  pool  of  receivables.  All  risks  of  loss  are  shared  pro  rata  based  on  participation  interests  held  among  all  participating stakeholders. We account for the asset transfer as a sale and derecognize the portion of the participation interests for which control has been surrendered. For this arrangement, gains or losses on the sale of the participation interests are not material as the carrying amount of the participation interest sold approximates the fair value at time of transfer.\n\nLoans,  advances,  and  interest  and  fees  receivable  are  reported  at  their  outstanding  balances,  net  of  any  participation  interests  sold  and  unamortized  deferred origination costs. We maintain the servicing rights for the entire pool of consumer and merchant receivables outstanding and receive a market-based service fee for servicing the assets underlying the participation interest sold.\n\nWe offer both revolving and installment credit products to our consumers.  The terms of our consumer relationships require us to submit monthly bills to the consumer detailing loan repayment requirements. The terms also allow us to charge the consumer interest and fees in certain circumstances. Due to the relatively small dollar amount of individual loans and interest receivable, we do not require collateral on these balances.\n\nIn certain instances where a merchant is able to demonstrate that it is experiencing financial difficulty, there may be a modification of the loan or advance and the related interest or fee receivable for which it is probable that, without modification, we would be unable to collect all amounts due.

Changes to the allowance for  interest  and  fees  receivable  are  reflected  within  revenues  from  other  value  added  services  in  net  revenues  on  our  consolidated statements of income (loss), or within deferred revenue in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, when interest and fees are billed at the inception of a loan or advance.

      "answer": "PayPal's need to fund $20.8 billion in consumer installment receivables through external partnerships increases its reliance on credit and funding markets. This activity contributes to broader market demand for credit-related financial instruments and exposes PayPal to liquidity constraints if alternative funding sources are not available. Since Citi reports credit valuation adjustments (CVA) and funding valuation adjustments (FVA) on over-the-counter derivatives as part of its principal transactions revenue, any market volatility or credit spread widening caused by increased demand for credit products \u2014 such as PayPal\u2019s large-scale loan sales \u2014 could affect the valuation of those derivatives. As a result, Citi's trading revenue may be indirectly influenced by PayPal\u2019s credit product funding activities through market-wide impacts on credit risk pricing and derivative valuations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_b - PayPal sold $20.8 billion of loans and interest receivable in 2024 under a multi-year agreement to fund its credit products.",

We expect that these credit rating agencies will continue to monitor our performance, including our capital structure and results of operations. Our goal is to be rated investment grade, but as circumstances change, there are factors that could result in our credit ratings being downgraded or put on a watch list for possible downgrading. If that were to occur, it could increase our borrowing rates, including the interest rate on borrowings under our credit agreements.\n\n## CURRENT AND FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENTS\n\nOur material cash requirements include funds to support current and potential: operating activities, credit products, customer protection programs, stock repurchases, strategic investments, acquisitions, other commitments, capital expenditures, and other future obligations.\n\n## Credit products\n\nGrowth in our portfolio of loans receivable increases our liquidity needs, and any inability to meet those liquidity needs could adversely affect our business. We continue to evaluate partnerships and third-party sources of funding for our credit products.\n\nThe  Luxembourg  Commission de  Surveillance du  Secteur  Financier (the 'CSSF') has agreed that  PayPal's management may designate up to 50% of  European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to fund European, U.K., and U.S. credit activities. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the cumulative amount approved by PayPal to be designated to fund credit activities was $2.0 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, and represented approximately 26% and 39% of European customer balances made available for our corporate use as of those respective dates, as determined by applying financial regulations maintained by the CSSF. We may periodically seek to change the designation of amounts of European customer balances for our credit activities, as we deem necessary, based on utilization of the approved funds and anticipated credit funding requirements. Under certain exceptional circumstances, corporate liquidity could be called upon to meet our obligations related to our European customer balances.\n\nIn June 2023, we entered into a multi-year agreement with a global investment firm to sell our eligible consumer installment receivables portfolio. In December 2024, this agreement was amended and restated to extend the commitment period to December 2026 and to increase the maximum balance of loans that can be sold at a time. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we sold $20.8 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively, of loans and interest receivable in connection with this agreement. For additional information, see 'Note 1-Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies' to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\n\nWhile our objective is to expand the availability of our credit products with capital from external sources, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving that goal.\n\n## Customer protection programs\n\nThe risk of losses from our customer protection programs are specific to individual consumers, merchants, and transactions, and may also be impacted by regional variations  in,  and  changes  or  modifications  to,  the  programs,  including  as  a  result  of  changes  in  regulatory  requirements.  For  the  periods  presented  in  these consolidated  financial  statements  included  in  this  report,  our  transaction  loss  rate  ranged  between  0.07%  and  0.09%  of  TPV .  Historical  loss  rates  may  not  be indicative of future results.\n\n## Stock repurchases\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased approximately $6.0 billion of our common stock in the open market under our stock repurchase program authorized in June 2022.

For the remaining available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, if we identify that the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses, taking into consideration changes to the rating of the security by rating agencies, implied yields versus benchmark yields, and the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, among other factors, we estimate the present value of cash flows expected to be collected. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss ex ists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis.

In December 2024, this agreement was amended and restated to extend the commitment period to December 2026 and to increase the maximum balance of loans that can be sold at a time. Following the sale, the global investment firm becomes the owner of the eligible consumer installment receivables sold and we no longer hold an ownership interest in these receivables.\n\nThese sales  of  eligible  consumer  installment  receivables  to  the  global  investment  firm  are  accounted  for  as  a  true  sale  based  on  our  determination  that  these receivables met all the necessary criteria for such accounting including legal isolation for transferred assets, ability of the transferee to pledge or exchange the transferred assets without constraint, and the transfer of control, and thus, we no longer record these receivables on our consolidated financial statements. We also concluded that our continuing involvement in the arrangement does not invalidate this determination. We maintain the servicing rights for the entire pool of the consumer installment receivables sold and receive a market-based service fee for servicing the assets sold.\n\nPrior to the decision to sell, this portfolio was reported at outstanding principal balances, including unamortized deferred origination costs and estimated collectible interest and fees, net of allowances for credit losses. At the time of reclassification of eligible consumer installment receivables to loans and interest receivable, held for sale in May 2023, any previously recorded allowance for credit losses for loans and interest receivable outstanding was reversed, resulting in a decrease in transaction and credit losses on our consolidated statements of income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nLoans and interest receivable, held for sale as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 represents installment consumer receivables that we originated and intend to sell to the global investment firm. Loans and interest receivable, held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, determined on an aggregate basis, with valuation changes and any associated charge-offs recorded in restructuring and other on our consolidated statements of income (loss). Interest income on interest bearing held-for-sale loans is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest.\n\nIf PayPal no longer intends to sell loans and interest receivable, held for sale, such loans would be reclassified to loans and interest receivable, held for investment.

There are uncertainties on how ongoing changes to federal, state, and international laws and regulations would apply to stablecoins in practice, and we and the PYUSD Issuer may face substantial costs to operationalize and comply with any additional or changed requirement. If we or the PYUSD Issuer fail to comply with regulations, requirements, prohibitions or other obligations applicable to us, we could face regulatory or other enforcement actions, potential fines, penalties, and other consequences. In addition, we could face reputational harm through our relationship with the PYUSD Issuer if the PYUSD Issuer were to face regulatory scrutiny, PYUSD is deemed to be a security, or PYUSD is alleged to be used for transactions in connection with illicit or illegal activities.\n\nWe hold our customers' cryptocurrency assets through one or more third-party custodians. Financial and third-party risks related to our customer cryptocurrency offerings, such as inappropriate access to, theft, or destruction of cryptocurrency assets held by our custodians, insufficient insurance coverage by a custodian to reimburse us for all such losses, a custodian's failure to maintain effective controls over the custody and settlement services provided to us, a custodian's inability to purchase or liquidate cryptocurrency holdings, the failure of the PYUSD Issuer to maintain sufficient reserve assets backing PYUSD and defaults on financial or performance obligations by a custodian, banks with which the  PYUSD  Issuer maintains reserve assets or counterparty financial institutions, could expose our customers and us to loss, and significantly harm our business, financial condition, and reputation.\n\nWe have selected custodian partners and the PYUSD Issuer, and may in the future select additional custodian partners and stablecoin issuing entities, that are subject  to  regulatory  oversight,  capital  requirements,  maintenance  of  audit  and  compliance  industry  certifications,  and  cybersecurity  procedures  and  policies. Nevertheless, any operational disruptions at any such custodian or issuer, or such custodians' or issuer's failure to safeguard cryptocurrency holdings (or reserve assets), could result in losses of customer assets, expose us to customer claims, reduce consumer confidence and materially impact our cryptocurrency product offerings and our operating results.\n\nCustodial arrangements to safeguard cryptocurrency assets involve unique risks and uncertainties in the event of a custodian's bankruptcy. While other types of assets and some custodied cryptocurrencies have been deemed not to be part of the custodian's bankruptcy estate under various regulatory regimes, bankruptcy courts have not yet definitively determined the appropriate treatment of custodial holdings of digital assets in a bankruptcy proceeding. In the event of a custodian's bankruptcy, the lack of precedent and the highly fact-dependent nature of the determination could delay or preclude the return of custodied cryptocurrency assets to us or to our customers. Although we contractually require our custodians to segregate our customer assets and not commingle them with proprietary or other assets, we cannot be certain that these contractual obligations, even if duly observed by a custodian, will be effective in preventing such assets from being treated as part of the custodian's estate under bankruptcy or other insolvency law. In that event, our claim on behalf of such customers against a custodian's estate for our customers' cryptocurrency assets could be treated as a general unsecured claim against the custodian, in which case our customers could seek to hold us liable for any resulting losses.\n\n## Lending Regulation\n\nWe hold a number of U.S. state lending licenses for our U.S. consumer short-term installment loan product, which is subject to federal and state laws governing consumer credit and debt collection. Similarly, the consumer short-term installment loan products that we offer outside the U.S. may be subject to consumer credit legislation, licensing requirements, consumer lending laws, consumer protection or banking transparency regulations. Increased global regulatory focus on shortterm installment products and consumer credit more broadly could result in laws or regulations requiring changes to our policies, procedures, operations, and product offerings, and restrict or limit our ability to offer credit products.\n\nConsumer Protection",

      "answer": "American Express incorporates macroeconomic conditions into its Exposure at Default modeling through a reasonable and supportable period (R&S Period), using past loss experience and current/future economic conditions to estimate probability of default, exposure at default, and expected recoveries. Beyond the R&S Period, it reverts to long-term average loss rates. It also uses qualitative reserves to address limitations in models or assumptions. In contrast, Citigroup explicitly ties its Exposure at Default modeling to specific macroeconomic variables such as housing prices, unemployment rate, and real GDP, and as of Q4 2024, Citigroup\u2019s qualitative component of the ACL decreased due to a release related to reserves for specific risks impacting vulnerable industries and regions. This indicates that Citigroup\u2019s qualitative reserves are more directly influenced by macroeconomic forecasts than American Express\u2019s, which relies more heavily on internal models and historical data.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - American Express estimates exposure at default using historical loss experience and current/future economic conditions within an R&S Period, with a reversion to long-term average loss rates beyond that period.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies model exposure at default using EAD, but Citigroup explicitly ties its EAD to macroeconomic variables and shows a measurable impact on its qualitative reserves, whereas American Express uses more internal and historical modeling with separate qualitative adjustments."

A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Reserves for Credit Losses on Card Member Loans\n\nAs described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans represent management's estimate of the expected credit losses in the Company's outstanding portfolio of Card Member loans as of the balance sheet date. The reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans was $5.7 billion as of December 31, 2024. Management estimates lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience, as well as current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period (R&amp;S Period) beyond the balance sheet date. As disclosed by management, in estimating expected credit losses, management uses a combination of statistically-based models that entail a significant amount of judgment. The primary areas of judgment used in measuring the quantitative components of the Company's reserves relate to the determination of the appropriate R&amp;S Period, the modeling of the probability of and exposure at default, and the methodology to incorporate current and future economic conditions. Management uses these models and assumptions, combined with historical loss ex perience, to determine the reserve rates that are applied to the outstanding loan balances to produce its reserves for ex pected credit losses. Within the R&amp;S Period, the Company's models use past loss experience and current and future economic conditions to estimate the probability of default, exposure at default and expected recoveries to estimate net losses at default. Beyond the R&amp;S Period, expected credit losses are estimated by immediately reverting to long-term average loss rates. Management also estimates the likelihood and magnitude of recovery of previously written off loans considering how long ago the loan was written off and future economic conditions. Additionally, management evaluates whether to include qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but may not be adequately represented in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. The qualitative reserves address possible limitations within the models or factors not included within the models, such as external conditions, emerging portfolio trends, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due accounts, or management risk actions.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans is a critical audit matter are (i) the estimate of the reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans involved significant judgment by management, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the models, significant inputs, qualitative reserves, and significant assumptions, including the R&amp;S Period and the loss rates used to estimate expected credit losses beyond the R&amp;S Period and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.",

The loss likelihood and severity models used for estimating expected credit losses are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic variables, including housing prices, unemployment rate and real GDP, and cover a wide range of geographic, industry, product and business segments.\n\nIn addition, Citi's models determine expected credit losses based on leading credit indicators, including loan delinquencies, changes in portfolio size, default frequency, risk ratings and loss recovery rates, as well as other credit trends.\n\n## Qualitative Component\n\nThe qualitative management adjustment component includes risks that are not fully captured in the quantitative component. These may include but are not limited to portfolio characteristics, idiosyncratic events, factors not within historical loss data or the economic forecast, uncertainty in the credit environment and other factors as required by banking supervisory guidance for the ACL. The primary examples of these are the following:\n\n- Transfer risk associated with exposures outside the U.S., driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law\n- Potential impacts on vulnerable industries and regions due to emerging macroeconomic risks and uncertainties, including those related to potential global recession, inflation, interest rates, commodity prices and geopolitical tensions\n- Risk associated with consumer payment behavior given the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment\n\nAs of the fourth quarter of 2024, Citi's qualitative component of the ACL decreased quarterover-quarter. The decrease was driven by factors such as a release related to reserves for specific risks and uncertainties impacting vulnerable industries and regions.\n\n## Macroeconomic Variables\n\nAs further discussed below, Citi considers various global macroeconomic variables for the base, upside and downside probability-weighted macroeconomic scenario forecasts it uses to estimate the quantitative component of the ACL. Citi's forecasts of the U.S. unemployment rate and U.S. real GDP growth rate represent the macroeconomic variables that most significantly affect its estimate of the ACL.\n\nThe tables below present Citi's forecasted quarterly average U.S. unemployment rate and year-over-year U.S. real GDP growth rate used in determining the base macroeconomic forecast for Citi's ACL at each quarterly reporting period from 4Q23 to 4Q24:\n\n",

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\nAssessment of the fair value of certain Level 3 assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 26 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis were $834,645 million, net and $317,033 million, net, respectively, at December 31, 2024. The Company estimated the fair value of Level 3 assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis ($9,194 million and $28,755 million, respectively, at December 31, 2024) utilizing various valuation techniques with one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers being unobservable including, but not limited to, complex internal valuation models, alternative pricing procedures or comparables analysis and discounted cash flows.\n\nWe identified the assessment of the measurement of fair value for certain Level 3 assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as a critical audit matter. A high degree of effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment of the Level 3 fair values due to measurement uncertainty. Specifically, the assessment encompassed the evaluation of the fair value methodology, including methods, models and significant assumptions used to estimate fair value. Significant assumptions include the use of proxy information, the extrapolation and interpolation of proxy information, and the use of historic pricing information as well as certain model assumptions. The assessment also included an evaluation of the conceptual soundness and performance of the valuation models.\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating the design and testing the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company's Level 3 fair value measurements including controls over:\n\n- valuation methodologies, including significant assumptions\n- independent price verification\n- evaluating that significant model assumptions reflected those which a market participant would use to determine an exit price in the current market environment\n- the valuation models used were mathematically accurate and appropriate to value the financial instruments and\n- relevant information used within the Company's models that was reasonably available was considered in the fair value determination.\n\nWe evaluated the Company's methodology for compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in developing an independent fair value estimate for a selection of certain Level 3 assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis based on independently developed valuation models and assumptions, as applicable, using market data sources we determined to be relevant and reliable and compared our independent expectation to the Company's fair value measurements.\n\nAssessment of the allowance for credit losses collectively evaluated for impairment As described in Notes 1 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's total allowance for credit losses on loans, leases and unfunded lending commitments was $20,175 million as of December 31, 2024, which includes the allowance related to loans and unfunded lending commitments collectively evaluated for impairment (the collective ACLL). The expected credit losses for the quantitative component of the collective ACLL is the product of multiplying the probability of default (PD), loss given default (LG D), and ex posure at default (EAD), which are determined utilizing models, for consumer and corporate loans. The PD, LGD, and EAD assumptions are determined based on three macroeconomic scenarios (base, downside and upside) multiplied by their respective scenario weights. The macroeconomic scenario weights are estimated based on a statistical model, which takes into consideration both internal and external forecasted macroeconomic variables over a reasonable and supportable period, after which mean reversion reflecting historical loss experience is used for the remaining life of the loan to estimate ex pected credit losses. The qualitative component considers, among other things, certain portfolio characteristics and idiosyncratic events. For consumer U.S. credit cards, the Company utilizes the payment rate approach to determine the payments needed to pay off the end-of-period balance in the estimation of the EAD. This approach incorporates payment rate curves and is used to estimate EAD. Reserves for unconditionally cancelable accounts are based on the expected life of the balance as of the evaluation date and do not include undrawn commitments that are unconditionally cancelable. In addition, the models for the delinquency-managed portfolios take into account leading credit indicators, including loan delinquencies and changes in portfolio size as well as economic trends, including current and future housing prices, unemployment, length of time in foreclosure, and costs to sell. The models for classifiably managed portfolios consider the credit quality as measured by risk ratings and economic factors.\n\nWe identified the assessment of the collective ACLL, specifically the quantitative component for the consumer U.S. credit cards which applies the delinquency-managed model and corporate loan portfolios which applies the classifiably managed model, and the qualitative component for the corporate portfolio as a critical audit",

      "answer": "American Express has already taken operational actions in response to regulatory pressures, exiting its network licensing businesses in the EU and Australia due to regulatory constraints on interchange fees and network operations. This reflects realized financial and operational impacts, such as potential loss of revenue and restructuring of business relationships in those regions. In contrast, Citigroup faces a prospective $1.6 billion CTA (Cumulative Translation Adjustment) loss tied to geopolitical instability in Russia, specifically in the event of a loss of control of AO Citibank. This represents a contingent liability rather than a realized loss, indicating that while Citigroup has not yet incurred the financial impact, it has identified a significant risk exposure due to geopolitical and regulatory uncertainty. The difference in impact mechanisms\u2014realized business exits for American Express versus contingent financial losses for Citigroup\u2014shows how regulatory and geopolitical pressures manifest differently across firms depending on their operational footprint and regulatory environment.",

New laws or regulations could similarly affect our business, increase the costs and complexity of doing business, impact what we are able to charge for, or offer in connection with, our products and services, impose conflicting obligations, and require us to change certain of our business practices and invest significant management attention and resources, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Political developments can result in legislative and regulatory uncertainty and changes to supervisory and enforcement priorities. In addition, legislators and regulators around the world are aware of each other's approaches to the regulation of the financial services industry. Consequently, a development in one country, state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another.\n\nIf we fail to satisfy regulatory requirements or maintain our financial holding company status, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, and we may be restricted in our ability to take certain capital actions (such as declaring dividends or repurchasing outstanding shares) or engage in certain business activities or acquisitions, which could compromise our competitive position. Additionally, our banking regulators have wide discretion in the examination and the enforcement of applicable banking statutes and regulations and may restrict our ability to engage in certain business activities or acquisitions or require us to maintain more capital. In 2024, we became a Category III firm for purposes of the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies' tailoring framework, resulting in us becoming subject to heightened regulatory expectations and more stringent regulatory requirements. As we continue to grow, these expectations and requirements may further increase, such as if we become a Category II firm, which may increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our business.\n\nLegislators and regulators continue to focus on the operation of card networks, including interchange fees paid to card issuers in payment networks such as Visa and Mastercard, network routing practices and the fees merchants are charged to accept cards. While in some cases our business is subject to exemptions related to certain of these regulations, there is no guarantee that such ex emptions will continue to be available and even where we are not directly regulated, regulation of bankcard fees significantly negatively impacts the discount revenue derived from our business, including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees. In some cases, regulations also extend, or may extend, to certain aspects of our business, such as network and cobrand arrangements, new products or services we may offer, or the terms of card acceptance for merchants, including terms relating to non-discrimination and honor-all-cards. For example, we have exited our network licensing businesses in the EU and Australia as a result of regulation in those jurisdictions. In addition, there is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the EU. See 'Supervision and Regulation - Payments Regulation' under 'Business' for more information. Given differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements, we are subject to regulatory action, penalties and the possibility we will not be able to maintain our existing cobrand and agent relationships in the EU. In addition, a number of federal and state laws to regulate various aspects of network operations are being considered or have passed, including regarding information associated with electronic transactions (such as the use of specific merchant categories codes or limitations on the use of transaction data) and pricing of electronic transactions (such as interchange fees on sales tax  or gratuities).\n\nLegislators and regulators also continue to focus on consumer protection, including product design and pricing constructs, account management and security, credit bureau reporting, disclosure rules, marketing and debt collection practices. This focus has included fees associated with card and banking products, such as a rule issued by the CFPB related to credit card fees for late payments (which is currently stayed); interest rates, such as recent proposals to cap credit card interest rates; rewards programs, such as the recent inquiries by the CFPB and DOT focused on credit card and airline rewards programs; and factors considered by financial institutions in providing services, such as 'fair access' laws. Any new requirements or increased enforcement of existing requirements could materially and adversely impact our revenue growth and profitability, including, as a result of increased scrutiny of our pricing, underwriting and account management practices; the imposition of fines and customer remediation; higher compliance costs; reputational harm; restrictions on our ability to issue cards, appropriately price for the value of our products or work with certain business partners; and changes to our business practices generally.\n\nWe are subject to significant supervision and regulation with respect to compliance with AML/CFT laws, sanctions regimes and anti-corruption laws in numerous jurisdictions. As regulators increase their focus in these areas, new technologies such as digital currencies develop, near real-time money movement solutions are adopted, we introduce new products like checking accounts and geopolitical tensions increase, we face increased costs related to oversight, supervision and potential fines. Our AML/CFT, sanctions and anti-corruption compliance programs have become the subject of heightened scrutiny, and we are working to make enhancements to our existing programs, policies and procedures and to identify and remediate deficiencies. For example, we recently voluntarily reported certain transactions and accounts to OFAC, some of which related to Iran, as described in 'Supervision and Regulation - Anti-Money Laundering, Countering the Financing of Terrorism, Economic Sanctions and Anti-Corruption Compliance' under 'Business.' Errors, failures or delays in complying with AML/CFT, sanctions and anti-corruption laws, deficiencies in our related compliance programs or association of our business with money laundering, terrorist financing, tax fraud or other illicit activities or sanctioned persons, entities, governments or countries can give rise to significant supervisory, criminal and civil proceedings and lawsuits, which could result in significant penalties and forfeiture of assets, loss of licenses or restrictions on business activities, or other enforcement actions, and our reputation may suffer due to our customers' association with certain countries, persons or entities or the existence of any such transactions. Additionally, our AML/CFT, sanctions and anti-corruption compliance programs may limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities or affect our relationships with certain partners, service providers and other third parties.\n\nSee 'Supervision and Regulation' under 'Business' for more information about certain laws and regulations to which we are subject and their impact on us.",

For instance, Citi may need to record additional translation losses due to currency controls in Argentina (see 'Managing Global Risk-Other Risks-Country Risk-Argentina' below). Moreover, Citi may need to record additional reserves for expected losses for its credit ex posures based on the transfer risk associated with exposures outside the U.S., driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law (see 'Managing Global Risk-Other RisksCountry Risk-Argentina' and '-Russia' and 'Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates' below).\n\nIn the event of a loss of control of AO Citibank in Russia, Citi would be required to (i) write off its remaining nominal net investment, (ii) recognize a CTA loss of approximately $1.6 billion through earnings and (iii) recognize a loss of $0.9 billion on intercompany liabilities owed by AO Citibank to other Citi entities outside of Russia. In the sole event of a substantial liquidation, as opposed to a loss of control, Citi would be required to recognize the CTA loss of approximately $1.6 billion through earnings and would evaluate its remaining net investment as circumstances evolve. For additional information about these risks and related potential impacts, see the operational processes and systems and cybersecurity risk factors above and 'Managing Global Risk-Other Risks-Country Risk-Russia' below.\n\nIn addition, political turmoil and instability; geopolitical challenges, tensions and conflicts (including those related to China, the Russia-Ukraine war and the conflicts in the Middle East); terrorism; and other instabilities have occurred in various regions and emerging market countries across the globe, which impact Citi's businesses, results of operations and financial conditions in those countries where Citi operates and have required, and may continue to require, management time and attention and other resources, such as managing the impact of sanctions and their effect on Citi's operations in certain emerging market countries.

      "question": "How does the risk of unsuccessful integration of acquired businesses impact both AIG's and MA's financial performance, based on their respective 2023 10-K disclosures?",
      "answer": "Both AIG and MA highlight that unsuccessful integration of acquired businesses could materially and adversely affect their financial performance. AIG specifically notes that integration challenges may lead to the acquired business performing below expectations, including the loss of customers and failure to realize anticipated expense-related efficiencies. MA similarly states that integration may divert management time and resources from the core business and disrupt operations, while also noting that acquisitions may not meet strategic or financial expectations.

        "Step 1: Extract from AIG's 10-K - 'Difficulties integrating an acquired business may result in the acquired business performing differently than we expected (including through the loss of customers) or in our failure to realize anticipated expense-related efficiencies.'",
        "Step 2: Extract from MA's 10-K - 'We may not be able to successfully partner with or integrate [acquired businesses], despite original intentions and focused efforts. Such an integration also may divert management's time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations.'",

These processes are manual in parts and may be subject to errors, delays, or system failures, increasing legal and operational risk. In contrast, PayPal's interest-bearing installment products are directly regulated under consumer lending laws in the U.S. and internationally, such as in Germany, where they must comply with local consumer protection and banking transparency regulations. PayPal's products are originated through PayPal (Europe), adding jurisdictional complexity. While Capital One's exposure centers on AI governance and regulatory uncertainty in multiple domains, PayPal's regulatory burden stems from product-specific compliance across diverse international frameworks, including licensing, disclosure, and lending practice requirements.",

Failure to manage data effectively and to aggregate data in an accurate and timely manner may limit our ability to manage current and emerging risk, to produce accurate financial, regulatory and operational reporting as well as to manage changing business needs. If our Framework is ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses which could materially adversely affect our results of operation or financial condition. Also, any information we provide to the public or to our regulators based on incorrectly designed or implemented models or AI could be inaccurate or misleading. Some of the decisions that our regulators make could be affected adversely due to the perception that the quality of the data, models and AI used to generate the relevant information is insufficient. In addition, regulation of AI is rapidly evolving worldwide as legislators and regulators are increasingly focused on these powerful emerging technologies. The technologies underlying AI and its uses are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including intellectual property, privacy, data protection and data security, consumer protection, competition, and equal opportunity laws, and are expected to be subject to increased regulation and new laws or new applications of existing laws and regulations. AI is the subject of ongoing review by various U.S. governmental and regulatory agencies, and various U.S. states and other foreign jurisdictions are applying, or are considering applying, their platform moderation, privacy, data protection and data security laws and regulations to AI or are considering general legal frameworks for AI. We may not be able to anticipate how to respond to these rapidly evolving frameworks, and we may need to expend resources to adjust our offerings in certain jurisdictions if the legal frameworks are inconsistent across jurisdictions. Furthermore, because AI technology itself is highly complex and rapidly developing, it is not possible to predict all of the legal, operational, competitive or technological risks that may arise relating to the use of AI.\n\n## Fraudulent activity associated with our products could cause our fraud losses to increase, the use of our products to decrease and our brands to suffer reputational damage, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe are subject to the risk of fraudulent activity associated with merchants, customers and other third parties handling customer information. The risk of fraud continues to be a persistent inherent risk for the financial services industry. Credit and debit card fraud, identity theft and electronic-transaction related crimes are prevalent and perpetrators are growing ever more sophisticated. Emerging generative AI capabilities, such as synthetic voice and conversation generation, introduced an increase in fraud risks, especially in the form of identity fraud. While we have policies and procedures designed to address such risk, there can be no assurance that losses will not occur. Our resources, customer authentication methods and fraud prevention tools may be insufficient to accurately predict, prevent or detect fraud. Consumer activists and regulators have sought to expand financial institutions' responsibility to hold customers harmless for fraudulent transactions that they authorized on their accounts.\n\nOur risk of fraud continues to increase as third parties that handle confidential consumer information suffer security breaches and we expand our digital banking business and introduce new products and features.

PayPal's interest-bearing installment product for consumers in G ermany is subject to applicable local laws such as consumer (lending) laws, consumer protection, or banking transparency regulations. These loans are originated by PayPal (Europe).\n\nPayPal and V enmo co-branded consumer credit cards and the PayPal Credit revolving consumer credit product are issued by an independent chartered financial institution in the U.S., and are subject to laws and regulations governing these programs. PayPal Credit in the U.K. is a regulated, revolving consumer credit product subject to applicable local laws and regulations.\n\nOur U.S. merchant lending products are subject to federal and state regulations and are offered by an independent chartered financial institution. Our merchant lending products offered in G ermany, France, and the Netherlands are subject to the laws of Luxembourg and certain local laws, and our merchant lending product offered in the U.K. is subject to U.K. regulation. The loans offered to European and U.K. merchants are originated by PayPal (Europe) and PayPal U.K., respectively. Our merchant lending product in Australia is subject to the laws of Australia and is originated by PayPal Credit Pty Limited.\n\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau ('CFPB'). The CFPB has significant authority to regulate consumer financial products in the U.S., including consumer credit, deposits, payments, and similar products. As a large market participant of remittance transfers, we are subject to the direct supervisory authority of the CFPB. The  CFPB  and  similar  regulatory  agencies  in  other  jurisdictions  may  have  broad  consumer  protection  mandates  that  could  result  in  the  promulgation  and interpretation of rules and regulations that may materially impact our business.\n\nAnti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, and sanctions. PayPal is subject to anti-money laundering ('AML') laws and regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, as well as laws designed to prevent the use of the financial systems to facilitate terrorist activities. Our AML program is designed to prevent our payments platform from being used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit activities, or to do business in countries or with persons and entities included on designated country or person lists promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Controls and equivalent authorities in other countries. Our AML and sanctions compliance programs, overseen by our AML/Bank Secrecy Act Officer, are composed of policies, procedures, and internal controls, and are designed to address these legal and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks.\n\nInterchange fees. Interchange fees (the transaction fees for processing credit and debit card transactions) are subject to regulation in certain jurisdictions.  For example, in the EU, the Multilateral Interchange Fee Regulation caps interchange fees and provides for business rules to be complied with by any company dealing with payment card transactions. Interchange fees are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions. As a result, the fees that we collect in certain jurisdictions may become the subject of regulatory challenge.\n\nData protection and privacy. We are subject to a number of laws, rules, directives, and regulations ('privacy and data protection laws') relating to the collection, use, retention, security, processing, and transfer (collectively, 'processing') of personally identifiable information about our customers, our merchants' customers, and employees ('personal data') in the countries where we operate. Our business relies on the processing of personal data in many jurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders. As a result, much of the personal data that we process, which may include certain financial information associated with individuals, is subject to one or more privacy and data protection laws in one or more jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between or among us, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercial relationships.\n\nRegulatory scrutiny of privacy, data protection, cybersecurity practices, and the processing of personal data is increasing around the world. Regulatory authorities are continuously considering numerous legislative and regulatory proposals and interpretive guidelines that may contain additional privacy and data protection obligations. Many jurisdictions in which we operate have adopted, or are in the process of adopting or amending data protection and privacy legislation or regulation aimed at creating and enhancing individual privacy rights and data protection obligations. In addition, the interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere are subject to change and may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny and business costs.\n\nAnti-corruption. PayPal is subject to applicable anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Anti-corruption laws generally prohibit offering, promising, giving, accepting, or authorizing others to provide anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to or from a government official or private party to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage, such as to obtain or retain business. We have implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with these laws and regulations.",

      "answer": "Capital One faces compliance challenges due to its reliance on AI in data management and risk modeling, which is subject to evolving consumer lending laws, including those related to data protection, equal opportunity, and accurate financial reporting. These laws require Capital One to ensure that its AI systems are transparent, accurate, and non-discriminatory, or it risks regulatory scrutiny and financial penalties. PayPal, on the other hand, holds U.S. state lending licenses for its short-term installment loan products and is subject to consumer lending laws that govern credit offerings and debt collection. Additionally, PayPal's introduction of PYUSD, a stablecoin, introduces regulatory uncertainty as evolving laws around cryptocurrency may impose additional compliance obligations, including how these digital products interact with existing consumer lending frameworks. Both companies must navigate complex and evolving legal landscapes, but PayPal's crypto operations add an additional layer of ambiguity not present in Capital One's more traditional credit offerings.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are subject to consumer lending laws, but in different ways: Capital One through AI-driven credit risk systems and PayPal through both traditional lending licenses and crypto-related financial products. This creates distinct compliance challenges under the same regulatory umbrella."

Failure to manage data effectively and to aggregate data in an accurate and timely manner may limit our ability to manage current and emerging risk, to produce accurate financial, regulatory and operational reporting as well as to manage changing business needs. If our Framework is ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses which could materially adversely affect our results of operation or financial condition. Also, any information we provide to the public or to our regulators based on incorrectly designed or implemented models or AI could be inaccurate or misleading. Some of the decisions that our regulators make could be affected adversely due to the perception that the quality of the data, models and AI used to generate the relevant information is insufficient. In addition, regulation of AI is rapidly evolving worldwide as legislators and regulators are increasingly focused on these powerful emerging technologies. The technologies underlying AI and its uses are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including intellectual property, privacy, data protection and data security, consumer protection, competition, and equal opportunity laws, and are expected to be subject to increased regulation and new laws or new applications of existing laws and regulations. AI is the subject of ongoing review by various U.S. governmental and regulatory agencies, and various U.S. states and other foreign jurisdictions are applying, or are considering applying, their platform moderation, privacy, data protection and data security laws and regulations to AI or are considering general legal frameworks for AI. We may not be able to anticipate how to respond to these rapidly evolving frameworks, and we may need to expend resources to adjust our offerings in certain jurisdictions if the legal frameworks are inconsistent across jurisdictions. Furthermore, because AI technology itself is highly complex and rapidly developing, it is not possible to predict all of the legal, operational, competitive or technological risks that may arise relating to the use of AI.\n\n## Fraudulent activity associated with our products could cause our fraud losses to increase, the use of our products to decrease and our brands to suffer reputational damage, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe are subject to the risk of fraudulent activity associated with merchants, customers and other third parties handling customer information. The risk of fraud continues to be a persistent inherent risk for the financial services industry. Credit and debit card fraud, identity theft and electronic-transaction related crimes are prevalent and perpetrators are growing ever more sophisticated. Emerging generative AI capabilities, such as synthetic voice and conversation generation, introduced an increase in fraud risks, especially in the form of identity fraud. While we have policies and procedures designed to address such risk, there can be no assurance that losses will not occur. Our resources, customer authentication methods and fraud prevention tools may be insufficient to accurately predict, prevent or detect fraud. Consumer activists and regulators have sought to expand financial institutions' responsibility to hold customers harmless for fraudulent transactions that they authorized on their accounts.\n\nOur risk of fraud continues to increase as third parties that handle confidential consumer information suffer security breaches and we expand our digital banking business and introduce new products and features. Our financial condition, the level of our fraud charge-offs and other results of operations could be materially adversely affected if fraudulent activity were to significantly increase. Furthermore, high-profile fraudulent activity could negatively impact our brand and reputation. In addition, significant increases in fraudulent activity could lead to regulatory intervention or other actions (such as mandatory card reissuance) and reputational and financial damage to our brands, which could negatively impact the use of our deposit accounts and cards and which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Risk\n\nCompliance with new and existing domestic and foreign laws, regulations and regulatory expectations is costly and complex, and any significant changes may adversely affect our business.\n\nA wide array of laws and regulations, including banking, tax and consumer lending laws and regulations, apply to every aspect of our business and these laws can be uncertain and evolving.

These PayPal and V enmo customers may, if provisioned for external transfers and subject to our sanctions and anti-money laundering controls, send PYUSD to external wallets not controlled by PayPal. The PYUSD Issuer may also allow institutional users to directly purchase PYUSD from the PYUSD Issuer (as per the PYUSD Issuer's stablecoin terms and conditions). The regulatory treatment of stablecoins is evolving and has drawn significant attention from legislative and regulatory bodies around the world, including the SEC. There are uncertainties on how ongoing changes to federal, state, and international laws and regulations would apply to stablecoins in practice, and we and the PYUSD Issuer may face substantial costs to operationalize and comply with any additional or changed requirement. If we or the PYUSD Issuer fail to comply with regulations, requirements, prohibitions or other obligations applicable to us, we could face regulatory or other enforcement actions, potential fines, penalties, and other consequences. In addition, we could face reputational harm through our relationship with the PYUSD Issuer if the PYUSD Issuer were to face regulatory scrutiny, PYUSD is deemed to be a security, or PYUSD is alleged to be used for transactions in connection with illicit or illegal activities.\n\nWe hold our customers' cryptocurrency assets through one or more third-party custodians. Financial and third-party risks related to our customer cryptocurrency offerings, such as inappropriate access to, theft, or destruction of cryptocurrency assets held by our custodians, insufficient insurance coverage by a custodian to reimburse us for all such losses, a custodian's failure to maintain effective controls over the custody and settlement services provided to us, a custodian's inability to purchase or liquidate cryptocurrency holdings, the failure of the PYUSD Issuer to maintain sufficient reserve assets backing PYUSD and defaults on financial or performance obligations by a custodian, banks with which the  PYUSD  Issuer maintains reserve assets or counterparty financial institutions, could expose our customers and us to loss, and significantly harm our business, financial condition, and reputation.\n\nWe have selected custodian partners and the PYUSD Issuer, and may in the future select additional custodian partners and stablecoin issuing entities, that are subject  to  regulatory  oversight,  capital  requirements,  maintenance  of  audit  and  compliance  industry  certifications,  and  cybersecurity  procedures  and  policies. Nevertheless, any operational disruptions at any such custodian or issuer, or such custodians' or issuer's failure to safeguard cryptocurrency holdings (or reserve assets), could result in losses of customer assets, expose us to customer claims, reduce consumer confidence and materially impact our cryptocurrency product offerings and our operating results.\n\nCustodial arrangements to safeguard cryptocurrency assets involve unique risks and uncertainties in the event of a custodian's bankruptcy. While other types of assets and some custodied cryptocurrencies have been deemed not to be part of the custodian's bankruptcy estate under various regulatory regimes, bankruptcy courts have not yet definitively determined the appropriate treatment of custodial holdings of digital assets in a bankruptcy proceeding. In the event of a custodian's bankruptcy, the lack of precedent and the highly fact-dependent nature of the determination could delay or preclude the return of custodied cryptocurrency assets to us or to our customers. Although we contractually require our custodians to segregate our customer assets and not commingle them with proprietary or other assets, we cannot be certain that these contractual obligations, even if duly observed by a custodian, will be effective in preventing such assets from being treated as part of the custodian's estate under bankruptcy or other insolvency law. In that event, our claim on behalf of such customers against a custodian's estate for our customers' cryptocurrency assets could be treated as a general unsecured claim against the custodian, in which case our customers could seek to hold us liable for any resulting losses.\n\n## Lending Regulation\n\nWe hold a number of U.S. state lending licenses for our U.S. consumer short-term installment loan product, which is subject to federal and state laws governing consumer credit and debt collection. Similarly, the consumer short-term installment loan products that we offer outside the U.S. may be subject to consumer credit legislation, licensing requirements, consumer lending laws, consumer protection or banking transparency regulations. Increased global regulatory focus on shortterm installment products and consumer credit more broadly could result in laws or regulations requiring changes to our policies, procedures, operations, and product offerings, and restrict or limit our ability to offer credit products.\n\nConsumer Protection",

The partner institution ex tends credit to consumers for interest-bearing installment products and to merchants for the PPWC and PPBL products, and we purchase the related receivables originated by the partner institution. In the U.S., we extend certain short-term, interest-free, installment loans to consumers through a U.S. subsidiary. For our international consumer credit products, we extend credit in the U.K and the rest of Europe through our U.K. subsidiary and Luxembourg banking subsidiary, respectively, and in Australia and Japan, through local subsidiaries. For our merchant finance products outside the U.S., we extend working capital advances and loans in the U.K. and rest of Europe through our U.K. subsidiary and Luxembourg banking subsidiary, respectively, and working capital loans in Australia through an Australian subsidiary.\n\nAs part of our arrangement with the partner institution in the U.S., we sell back a participation interest in the pool of receivables for the consumer interest-bearing installment products, PPWC, and PPBL. The partner institution has no recourse against us related to their participation interests for failure of debtors to pay when due. The participation interests held by the partner institution have the same priority to the interests held by us and are subject to the same credit, prepayment, and interest  rate  risk  associated  with  this  pool  of  receivables.  All  risks  of  loss  are  shared  pro  rata  based  on  participation  interests  held  among  all  participating stakeholders. We account for the asset transfer as a sale and derecognize the portion of the participation interests for which control has been surrendered. For this arrangement, gains or losses on the sale of the participation interests are not material as the carrying amount of the participation interest sold approximates the fair value at time of transfer.\n\nLoans,  advances,  and  interest  and  fees  receivable  are  reported  at  their  outstanding  balances,  net  of  any  participation  interests  sold  and  unamortized  deferred origination costs. We maintain the servicing rights for the entire pool of consumer and merchant receivables outstanding and receive a market-based service fee for servicing the assets underlying the participation interest sold.\n\nWe offer both revolving and installment credit products to our consumers.  The terms of our consumer relationships require us to submit monthly bills to the consumer detailing loan repayment requirements. The terms also allow us to charge the consumer interest and fees in certain circumstances. Due to the relatively small dollar amount of individual loans and interest receivable, we do not require collateral on these balances.\n\nIn certain instances where a merchant is able to demonstrate that it is experiencing financial difficulty, there may be a modification of the loan or advance and the related interest or fee receivable for which it is probable that, without modification, we would be unable to collect all amounts due. Another partner  institution  is  the  ex clusive  issuer  of  the  PayPal  Credit  consumer  financing  program  in  the  U.S.  We  do  not  hold  an  ownership  interest  in  the receivables generated through the program and therefore, do not record these receivables on our consolidated financial statements. PayPal earns a revenue share on the  portfolio  of  consumer  receivables  owned  by  the  partner  institution,  which  is  recorded  in  revenues  from  other  value  added  services  on  our  consolidated statements of income (loss).\n\n## Allowance for loans and interest receivable\n\nThe allowance for loans and interest receivable represents our estimate of current expected credit losses inherent in our portfolio of loans and interest receivables. Changes to the allowance for loans receivable are reflected as a component of transaction and credit losses on our consolidated statements of income (loss). Changes to the allowance for  interest  and  fees  receivable  are  reflected  within  revenues  from  other  value  added  services  in  net  revenues  on  our  consolidated statements of income (loss), or within deferred revenue in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, when interest and fees are billed at the inception of a loan or advance.

To assess a merchant seeking a loan or advance, we use, among other indicators, risk models developed internally which utilize information obtained from multiple internal and external data sources to predict the likelihood of timely and satisfactory repayment by the merchant of the loan or advance amount and the related interest or fee. Primary drivers of the models include  the  merchant's  annual  payment  volume,  payment  processing  history  with  PayPal,  prior  repayment  history  with  PayPal's  credit  products  where available,  information  sourced  from  consumer  and  business  credit  bureau  reports,  and  other  information  obtained  during  the  application  process.

      "answer": "AIG employs market-observable information extensively in its fair value measurements, particularly for fixed maturity securities, using quoted prices in active markets or data from independent third-party valuation service providers that incorporate inputs such as benchmark yields, credit spreads, and quoted prices for similar securities. When market transactions or observable data are limited, AIG increases its reliance on judgment. In contrast, Capital One reports that transfers into Level 3 fair value measurements were primarily driven by the usage of unobservable assumptions, evidenced by wider pricing variations among pricing vendors. Transfers out of Level 3 were due to the increased use of assumptions corroborated by market-observable information. This indicates that AIG generally prioritizes observable data and third-party validation, while Capital One experienced greater volatility in the use of unobservable inputs affecting Level 3 assets.",

      "answer": "BK has an explicit authorization for the issuance of Series A Noncumulative Preferred Stock through its Certificate of Designations dated June 15, 2007. However, V reported zero outstanding shares for Series A preferred stock in 2023, despite having conversion rates into Class A common stock defined. This contrast reveals that BK maintains the flexibility to issue preferred stock as part of its capital strategy, while V has not utilized Series A preferred stock in its capital structure, possibly relying more on other forms of equity or debt.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - BK has a Certificate of Designations dated June 15, 2007, that explicitly authorizes the issuance of Series A Noncumulative Preferred Stock.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - The presence of an explicit authorization in BK's filings versus zero utilization in V's capital structure reveals differing approaches to preferred stock in their capital strategies."

      "question": "How do the differences in preferred stock structures between BK and V affect their respective earnings per share calculations?",
      "answer": "BK's Series A preferred stock is noncumulative, meaning that if dividends are not declared in a given period, they do not accumulate for future payment. This structure simplifies the earnings allocation process since no arrears of dividends need to be considered in earnings per share (EPS) calculations. In contrast, V's Series A, B, and C preferred stock are classified as participating securities, which means they have non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents and must be included in both basic and diluted EPS calculations. For V, net income is allocated to these preferred shares based on proportional ownership on an as-converted basis, which directly reduces the earnings available to common shareholders. Therefore, V's preferred stock structure has a more direct dilutive effect on EPS compared to BK's, where the noncumulative nature of preferred stock does not create a carryover obligation that could further reduce earnings available to common shareholders in future periods.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From BK's filing, identify that its Series A preferred stock is noncumulative, indicating that undeclared dividends do not accumulate.",
        "Step 2: From V's filing, note that its Series A, B, and C preferred stock are participating securities with non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, which must be included in EPS calculations.",
        "Step 3: Compare how each company's preferred stock structure affects the allocation of net income and the calculation of earnings per share\u2014BK's does not accumulate dividends, while V's requires allocation of earnings to preferred shareholders on an as-converted basis.",
        "Step 4: Conclude that V's preferred stock structure has a more direct impact on reducing earnings available to common shareholders in EPS calculations due to the participating nature of the preferred shares."

      "answer": "AIG disclosed only one specific RSU Award Agreement in its 2023 filing, which was the 'RSU Award Agreement, between American International Group, Inc. and Peter Zaffino.' In contrast, Goldman Sachs disclosed seven distinct types of RSU Award Agreements, including forms for Year-End RSU Awards (both fully vested and not fully vested), Short-Term RSU Awards, Fixed Allowance RSU Awards, and Performance-Based RSU Awards. This indicates that Goldman Sachs employs a more differentiated and performance-tailored RSU structure, while AIG appears to utilize a more streamlined or individualized approach focused on specific executives.",

        "Step 1: Extract from AIG's 2023 filing - AIG disclosed only one RSU Award Agreement specifically referenced in Exhibit 10.56, related to Peter Zaffino.",

      "question": "How do the regulatory impacts of interchange fee caps specifically affect both American Express's and Capital One's revenue models, given their distinct international exposure and partnership strategies?",
      "answer": "American Express faces regulatory uncertainty in the EU due to the potential application of interchange fee caps in co-brand and agent relationships, particularly highlighted by the referral of questions to the EU Court of Justice by the Dutch Trade and Industry Appeals Tribunal regarding its co-brand relationship with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. This uncertainty could lead to regulatory penalties or the termination of co-brand arrangements, directly affecting its discount revenue. Meanwhile, Capital One notes that interchange fees are a meaningful source of revenue for its credit and debit card businesses, covering issuer costs, funding rewards programs, offsetting fraud, and supporting innovation. Regulatory caps on interchange fees in jurisdictions like the UK and Canada have already impacted its international card business, potentially reducing revenue and profitability. Together, these regulatory pressures force both companies to adapt their revenue strategies and partnership models in affected regions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from AXP evidence - AXP is facing regulatory uncertainty in the EU concerning interchange fee caps in co-brand and agent relationships, specifically involving KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.",
        "Step 2: Extract from COF evidence - COF states that interchange fees are a meaningful source of revenue, covering issuer costs, funding rewards, offsetting fraud, and supporting innovation, and that caps in the UK and Canada have already impacted its international card business.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are impacted by interchange fee regulations, but in different ways: AXP faces legal and operational uncertainty in the EU co-brand market, while COF has already experienced revenue effects from caps in the UK and Canada. These regulatory constraints force both firms to reconsider international expansion, partnership strategies, and pricing models."

      "question": "How do the regulatory impacts of interchange fee caps in the EU and UK, as described by American Express and Capital One respectively, affect their co-brand and private label credit card operations in those regions?",
      "answer": "The regulatory impacts of interchange fee caps in the EU and UK create downward pressure on merchant discount rates for both American Express and Capital One, reducing the revenue they can earn from their co-brand and private label credit card operations. American Express specifically notes that interchange fee caps in the EU have negatively impacted its discount revenue and created uncertainty around its co-brand relationships due to differing regulatory interpretations. Capital One highlights that interchange fee caps in the UK and Canada have materially impacted its international card business, as interchange fees are a key revenue source that funds rewards programs and offsets fraud and management costs. Together, these regulatory constraints limit the financial viability and operational flexibility of both companies\u2019 co-brand and private label card programs in these regions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - American Express states that interchange fee caps in the EU have negatively impacted discount revenue and created uncertainty around co-brand relationships due to differing regulatory interpretations.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Capital One states that interchange fee caps in the UK and Canada have materially impacted its international card business, as interchange fees fund rewards programs and offset fraud and management costs.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies rely on interchange fees to support their co-brand and private label credit card operations, and regulatory caps in the EU and UK reduce revenue and operational flexibility, thereby adversely affecting these programs."

      "question": "How does the Proposed CFPB Rule on credit card late fees specifically impact the fee revenue strategies of both American Express (AXP) and Capital One (COF), and what is the combined effect on their respective financial conditions based on their regulatory exposure?",
      "answer": "The Proposed CFPB Rule on credit card late fees negatively impacts both American Express (AXP) and Capital One (COF) by potentially reducing fee revenue. AXP explicitly states that the rule 'could negatively impact our fee revenue,' which is a significant component of its business model. COF is similarly affected, as the rule seeks to lower the safe harbor amount for past due fees that credit card issuers can charge. Since both companies rely on fee income and are subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny, the rule could materially affect their financial conditions by reducing revenue streams and increasing compliance costs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - AXP states that the Proposed CFPB Rule 'could negatively impact our fee revenue.'",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - COF is directly impacted by the Proposed CFPB Rule, which 'seeks to lower the safe harbor amount for past due fees that a credit card issuer can charge.'",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are subject to the same regulatory pressure, and both derive significant revenue from credit card fees. The rule would constrain their ability to charge late fees, directly affecting profitability and requiring adjustments to business practices."

      "question": "How does the transition of AXP to a Category III firm under U.S. federal banking regulations potentially impact its capital adequacy ratios, and how might this interact with COF's reliance on models and AI for regulatory capital calculations?",
      "answer": "AXP anticipates transitioning to a Category III firm in 2024 due to its total consolidated assets reaching $261 billion as of December 31, 2023. This shift subjects AXP to heightened capital, liquidity, and prudential requirements, which could affect its capital adequacy ratios such as Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1, and Total capital. These ratios are critical for compliance with regulatory capital rules and are calculated using risk-weighted assets under the standardized approach. Meanwhile, COF relies heavily on models and AI for regulatory capital calculations, including capital adequacy assessments. If AXP\u2019s transition leads to more stringent capital requirements, COF\u2019s models must accurately reflect these changes to ensure correct capital adequacy reporting. Any deficiency or inaccuracy in COF\u2019s models could lead to misreporting of capital levels, regulatory missteps, or operational inefficiencies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AXP's total consolidated assets were $261 billion as of December 31, 2023, which places it in Category III under federal banking regulations.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source A - Category III firms are subject to heightened capital, liquidity, and prudential requirements, including stress tests and capital adequacy rules under the standardized approach.",
        "Step 3: Extract from source B - COF uses models and AI for regulatory capital calculations, including capital adequacy assessments, which must be accurate to ensure compliance and avoid misreporting.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - AXP\u2019s transition to Category III increases the complexity of its capital adequacy reporting, which relies on accurate modeling. COF\u2019s use of models must adapt to these regulatory changes to avoid inaccuracies or regulatory misinterpretations."

      "answer": "Goldman Sachs (GS) has issued Depositary Shares representing 1/1,000th interest in a Share of Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series D (trading under GS PRD on NYSE), indicating a structured financial instrument tied to Series D Preferred Stock. MetLife (MET) explicitly references Series D Preferred Stock in its 10-K filing, describing the regulatory risk where a 'rating agency event' could result in a lowering of equity credit assigned to this security. The combined impact centers on GS's capital structure and MET's regulatory capital treatment: GS relies on this instrument for capital generation, while MET's capital adequacy depends on external recognition of this stock\u2019s equity credit. A downgrade in equity credit for Series D would directly affect MET\u2019s Tier 1 capital status and indirectly affect GS by reducing investor confidence and potential future issuance value.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - GS issues Depositary Shares tied to Series D Preferred Stock (GS PRD on NYSE), indicating its financial structure includes this instrument.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - MET discloses that a 'rating agency event' affecting Series D Preferred Stock could lower equity credit assigned to the security, impacting its regulatory capital treatment.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - GS's issuance of Series D-related shares and MET's regulatory exposure to the same instrument create a dual impact: GS depends on the instrument's market perception for capital, while MET depends on its regulatory classification for Tier 1 capital adequacy."

      "answer": "The 2023 FSOC final guidance simplifies and shortens the process for designating non-bank financial institutions as systemically important financial institutions (non-bank SIFIs) by removing the requirement for cost-benefit analysis and assessments of the likelihood of material financial distress. This change increases the likelihood of regulatory scrutiny and potential designation for firms like Goldman Sachs, which would then face additional supervision, examination, and regulation by the Federal Reserve. As a result, such designation could create operational uncertainties for Goldman Sachs, including the frequency and impact of regulatory actions, the scope of regulatory requirements, and the permissibility of certain activities or transactions, as outlined in MetLife's 10-K.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From MetLife's 10-K, the 2023 FSOC final guidance removes the requirement for cost-benefit analysis and likelihood assessment before designating non-bank SIFIs.",
        "Step 2: This revised process could simplify and shorten FSOC's procedures, increasing the likelihood of designation for non-bank financial companies.",
        "Step 3: If Goldman Sachs were to be designated a non-bank SIFI, it would face additional regulatory oversight by the Federal Reserve, as both are subject to Dodd-Frank regulations.",
        "Step 4: Such designation would introduce operational uncertainties for Goldman Sachs, including regulatory actions, compliance measures, and activity limitations."

      "question": "How does the revised FSOC designation process under Dodd-Frank create differential regulatory uncertainty for MetLife compared to Goldman Sachs, given that both firms are subject to Dodd-Frank regulations?",
      "answer": "The revised FSOC designation process under Dodd-Frank increases regulatory uncertainty for MetLife by potentially classifying it as a non-bank SIFI, subjecting it to additional Federal Reserve supervision and creating unpredictability around regulatory actions, compliance requirements, and permissible activities. Unlike Goldman Sachs, which is primarily subject to general SEC filing requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 without specific mention of FSOC designation risk, MetLife faces direct exposure to the new FSOC guidance that eliminates the need for cost-benefit analysis or material distress assessment before designation. This creates a more immediate and specific regulatory risk for MetLife, particularly due to its status as an insurance holding company.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Goldman Sachs is subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as evidenced by its SEC filing requirements.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - MetLife faces increased regulatory uncertainty due to the revised FSOC guidance that simplifies the designation of non-bank SIFIs without requiring cost-benefit analysis or distress assessment.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both firms are subject to Dodd-Frank, but MetLife is exposed to a more specific and impactful regulatory mechanism (FSOC designation risk) that is not present for Goldman Sachs, leading to differential regulatory uncertainty."

This uncertainty may lead to customer attrition, supplier and business partner disengagement, and challenges in retaining key employees at Discover, all of which could diminish the anticipated benefits of the transaction. Visa, in its 10-K filing, explicitly identifies Discover as a competitor operating a closed-loop payments system and expresses concern about disintermediation. If Discover becomes less effective due to the acquisition-related disruptions, Visa could gain a relative competitive advantage as one of the dominant open-loop networks, especially as it faces increasing pressure from closed-loop systems and alternative payment platforms.",

Existing customers, suppliers and other business partners of ours and of Discover could decide to no longer do business with us or with Discover before the completion of the Transaction or with us after the Transaction is completed, reducing its anticipated benefits. Both parties are also subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our respective businesses while the Transaction is pending. As a result, certain projects may be delayed or abandoned and business decisions could be deferred. Employee retention may be challenging for Discover before completion of the Transaction, as certain employees of Discover may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us following the Transaction, and these retention challenges will require us to incur additional expenses in order to retain key employees of Discover. If key employees of Discover depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with Discover or with us following the Transaction, the benefits of the Transaction could be materially diminished.\n\n## General Economic and Market Risks\n\nChanges and instability in the macroeconomic environment could disrupt capital markets, reduce consumer and business activity, and weaken the labor market, all of which could impact borrowers' ability to service their debt obligations and adversely impact our financial results.\n\nChanges or instability in the macroeconomic environment may impact payment patterns, consumer spending, and credit losses. Because we offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients, our financial results are impacted by the level of consumer and business activity and the demand for our products and services. A prolonged period of economic weakness, volatility, slow growth, or a significant deterioration in economic conditions, in the countries in which we operate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as customers or commercial clients default on their loans, maintain lower deposit levels or, in the case of credit card accounts, carry lower balances and reduce credit card purchase activity.\n\nSome of the factors that could disrupt capital markets, reduce consumer and business activity, and weaken the labor market include the following:\n\n- Monetary policy actions, such as changes to interest rates, taken by the Federal Reserve and other central banks, such as the central banks in the United Kingdom and Canada, and a growing fiscal deficit and increase in the U.S. debt to gross domestic product ratio;\n- Fiscal policy actions, such as changes to applicable tax codes;\n- Geopolitical conflicts or instabilities, such as the war between Ukraine and Russia and the conflict in the Middle East, and increased geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China;\n- Trade wars, tariffs, labor shortages and disruptions of global supply chains;\n- The effects of stalemates in the U.S. government, including government shutdowns whether recurring, prolonged or otherwise, developments related to the U.S. federal debt ceiling, default by the U.S. government on its debt obligations, or related credit-rating downgrades;\n- Inflation and deflation, including the effects of related governmental responses;\n- Concerns over a potential recession, which may lead to adjustments in spending patterns;\n- Technology-driven disruption of certain industries, such as those due to advances in AI, robotics and cryptocurrency;\n- Lower demand for credit and shifts in consumer behavior, including shifts away from using credit cards, changes in deposit practices, and changes in payment patterns; and\n- Changes in usage of commercial real estate, which may have a sustained negative impact on utilization rates and values.\n\nDecreases in overall business activity and changes in customer behavior may lead to increases in our charge-off rate caused by bankruptcies and may reduce our ability to recover debt that we have previously charged-off. Such changes may also decrease the reliability of our internal processes and models, including those we use to estimate our allowance for credit losses,\n\n26\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)",

For more information, please see Item 1-Competition above.\n\nOur competitors may acquire, dev elop, or make better use of substantially better technology, hav e more widely adopted deliv ery channels, or hav e greater financial resources. T hey may offer more effectiv e, innov ativ e or a wider range of programs, products and serv ices. T hey may use more effectiv e advertising  and  marketing  strategies  that  result  in  broader  brand  recognition  and  greater  use,  including  with  respect  to  issuance  and  merchant acceptance.  They  may  also  dev elop  better  security  solutions  or  more  fav orable  pricing  arrangements.  Moreov er,  ev en  if  we  successfully  adapt  to technological change and the proliferation of alternativ e types of payment serv ices by dev eloping and offering our own serv ices in these areas, such serv ices may prov ide less fav orable financial terms for us than we currently receiv e from VisaNet transactions, which could hurt our financial results and prospects.\n\nCertain of our competitors operate with different business models, hav e different cost structures or participate in different market segments. Many of these competitors are also able to use existing payment networks without being subject to many of the associated costs. Moreov er, these competitors also occupy v arious roles in the payments ecosystem that enable them to influence payment choice of other participants. Those business models may ultimately prov e more successful or more adaptable to regulatory, technological and other dev elopments. In some cases, these competitors hav e the support of gov ernment mandates that prohibit, limit or otherwise hinder our ability to compete for transactions within certain countries and regions. Some of our competitors, including American Express, Discov er, priv ate-label card networks, v irtual currency prov iders, technology companies that enable the exchange of digital assets, and certain alternativ e payments systems like Alipay and WeChat Pay, operate closed-loop payments systems, with direct connections to both merchants and consumers. Government actions or initiativ es such as the Dodd-Frank Act, the IFR in Europe, or RTP initiativ es by governments  such  as  the  U.S.  Federal  Reserv e's  FedNow  or  the  Central  Bank  of  Brazil's  Pix  system  may  prov ide  competitors  with  increased opportunities to deriv e competitiv e adv antages from these business models, and may create new competitors, including in some cases the gov ernment itself. Similarly, regulation in Europe under PSD2 and the IFR may require us to open up access to, and allow participation in, our network to additional participants, and reduce the infrastructure inv estment and regulatory burden on competitors. In addition to the open banking prov isions under PSD2, efforts to implement or facilitate open banking and open finance requirements are underway across a number of countries, including Australia, Brazil, Canada and the U.S., which could impose additional requirements on financial institutions or others regarding access to and use of financial data. We also  run  the  risk  of  disintermediation  due  to  factors  such  as  emerging  technologies  and  platforms,  including  mobile  payments,  alternativ e  payment credentials, other ledger technologies or payment forms, and by v irtue of increasing bilateral agreements between entities that prefer not to use our payments network for processing transactions. For example, merchants could process transactions directly with issuers, or processors could process transactions directly with issuers and acquirers.\n\nWe expect the competitiv e landscape to continue to shift and ev olv e. For example:\n\n- We, along with our competitors, clients, network participants, and others are dev eloping or participating in alternativ e payments systems or products, such as mobile payment serv ices, ecommerce payment serv ices, P2P payment serv ices, real-time and faster payment initiativ es, and payment  serv ices  that  permit ACH  or  direct  debits  from  or  to  consumer  checking  accounts,  that  could  either  reduce  our  role  or  otherwise disintermediate  us  from  the  transaction  processing  or  the  v alue-added  serv ices  we  prov ide  to  support  such  processing.  Examples  include initiativ es from T he Clearing House, an association consisting of large financial institutions that has dev eloped its own faster payments system; Early  Warning  Serv ices,  which  operates  Z elle,  a  bank-offered  alternativ e  network  that  prov ides  another  platform  for  faster  funds  or  real-time payments across a variety of payment types, including P2P, corporate and gov ernment disbursement, bill pay and deposit check transactions; and cryptocurrency or stablecoin-based payments initiativ es.\n- Many countries or regions are dev eloping or promoting domestic networks, switches and RTP systems (e.g., U.S., Brazil, India and Europe) and in some countries the gov ernment itself owns and operates these RTP systems (e.g., Brazil). T o the extent these gov ernments mandate local banks and merchants to use and accept these systems for domestic or other transactions, prohibit international payments networks, like Visa, from  participating  on  those  systems,  and/or  impose  restrictions  or  prohibitions  on  international  payments  networks  from  offering  payment serv ices on such transactions, we could face the risk of our business being disintermediated in those countries.

Capital One explicitly states in its 2024 10-K that its ability to compete depends on its ability to keep pace with innovation, particularly in the development of new technology platforms.

In general, customers are attracted to credit card issuers largely on the basis of price, credit limit, reward programs, customer ex perience and other product features. \u00ae \u00ae\n\nOur Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking businesses compete with national, state and direct banks as well as with savings and loan associations and credit unions for loans and deposits. Our competitors also include automotive finance companies, commercial banking companies and other financial services providers that provide loans, deposits, and other similar services and products. In addition, we compete against non-bank institutions that are able to offer these products and services.\n\nWe also consider new and emerging companies in digital and mobile payments and other financial technology providers among our competitors. We compete with many forms of payment mechanisms, systems and products, offered by both bank and non-bank providers.\n\nOur businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and range of their products and services, transaction execution, innovation and price.  Competition varies based on the types of clients, customers, industries and geographies served. Our ability to compete depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain our associates and on our reputation as well as our ability to keep pace with innovation, in particular in the development of new technology platforms. There can be no assurance, however, that our ability to market products and services successfully or to obtain adequate returns on our products and services will not be impacted by the nature of the competition that now exists or may later develop, or by the broader economic environment. For a discussion of the risks related to our competitive environment, see 'Item 1A. Risk Factors.'\n\n## SUPERVISION AND REGULATION\n\n## General\n\nThe regulatory framework applicable to banking organizations is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the stability of the U.S. financial system, rather than for the protection of stockholders and creditors.\n\nAs a banking organization, we are subject to extensive regulation and supervision. In addition to banking laws and regulations, we are subject to various other laws and regulations, all of which directly or indirectly affect our operations, management and ability to make distributions to stockholders. We and our subsidiaries are also subject to supervision and examination by multiple regulators. In addition to laws and regulations, state and federal bank regulatory agencies may issue policy statements, interpretive letters and similar written guidance applicable to us and our subsidiaries. Any change in the statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to us, including changes in their interpretation or implementation, could have a material effect on our business or organization.\n\nBoth the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which we are subject have increased, initially in response to the 2007-2008 financial crisis, and more recently in light of other factors such as technological, political and market changes, as well as the 2023 regional bank failures. Regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector.\n\nThe descriptions below summarize certain significant federal and state laws, as well as international laws, to which we are subject. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provisions summarized. They do not summarize all possible or proposed changes in current laws or regulations and are not intended to be a substitute for the related statutes or regulatory provisions.\n\n## Prudential Regulation of Banking\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation is a bank holding company ('BHC') and a financial holding company ('FHC') under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended ('BHC Act'), and is subject to the requirements of the BHC Act, including approval requirements for investments in or acquisitions of banking organizations, capital adequacy standards and limitations\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)",

      "question": "How does the competitive pressure from American Express, as described in both Capital One's and Visa's 2024 10-K filings, differently affect their respective business models in the credit card and payments ecosystem?",
      "answer": "Capital One (COF) competes with American Express in its Credit Card business based on factors such as price, credit limit, reward programs, and customer experience. This competition affects Capital One\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers in a market where product features and innovation are key differentiators. Meanwhile, Visa (V) faces a different type of competitive challenge from American Express, as a closed-loop payment system that directly connects merchants and consumers, potentially disintermediating Visa from transaction processing. This structural competition threatens Visa\u2019s traditional role in the payments ecosystem, especially when combined with regulatory shifts like PSD2 and IFR that lower barriers for new entrants. Therefore, while Capital One must differentiate its credit card offerings to retain market share, Visa must adapt its network infrastructure and value-added services to avoid disintermediation by vertically integrated competitors like American Express.",

In general, customers are attracted to credit card issuers largely on the basis of price, credit limit, reward programs, customer ex perience and other product features. \u00ae \u00ae\n\nOur Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking businesses compete with national, state and direct banks as well as with savings and loan associations and credit unions for loans and deposits. Our competitors also include automotive finance companies, commercial banking companies and other financial services providers that provide loans, deposits, and other similar services and products. In addition, we compete against non-bank institutions that are able to offer these products and services.\n\nWe also consider new and emerging companies in digital and mobile payments and other financial technology providers among our competitors. We compete with many forms of payment mechanisms, systems and products, offered by both bank and non-bank providers.\n\nOur businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and range of their products and services, transaction execution, innovation and price.  Competition varies based on the types of clients, customers, industries and geographies served. Our ability to compete depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain our associates and on our reputation as well as our ability to keep pace with innovation, in particular in the development of new technology platforms. There can be no assurance, however, that our ability to market products and services successfully or to obtain adequate returns on our products and services will not be impacted by the nature of the competition that now exists or may later develop, or by the broader economic environment. For a discussion of the risks related to our competitive environment, see 'Item 1A. Risk Factors.'\n\n## SUPERVISION AND REGULATION\n\n## General\n\nThe regulatory framework applicable to banking organizations is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the stability of the U.S. financial system, rather than for the protection of stockholders and creditors.\n\nAs a banking organization, we are subject to extensive regulation and supervision. In addition to banking laws and regulations, we are subject to various other laws and regulations, all of which directly or indirectly affect our operations, management and ability to make distributions to stockholders. We and our subsidiaries are also subject to supervision and examination by multiple regulators. In addition to laws and regulations, state and federal bank regulatory agencies may issue policy statements, interpretive letters and similar written guidance applicable to us and our subsidiaries. Any change in the statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to us, including changes in their interpretation or implementation, could have a material effect on our business or organization.\n\nBoth the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which we are subject have increased, initially in response to the 2007-2008 financial crisis, and more recently in light of other factors such as technological, political and market changes, as well as the 2023 regional bank failures. Regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector.\n\nThe descriptions below summarize certain significant federal and state laws, as well as international laws, to which we are subject. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provisions summarized. They do not summarize all possible or proposed changes in current laws or regulations and are not intended to be a substitute for the related statutes or regulatory provisions.\n\n## Prudential Regulation of Banking\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation is a bank holding company ('BHC') and a financial holding company ('FHC') under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended ('BHC Act'), and is subject to the requirements of the BHC Act, including approval requirements for investments in or acquisitions of banking organizations, capital adequacy standards and limitations\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)",

For more information, please see Item 1-Competition above.\n\nOur competitors may acquire, dev elop, or make better use of substantially better technology, hav e more widely adopted deliv ery channels, or hav e greater financial resources. T hey may offer more effectiv e, innov ativ e or a wider range of programs, products and serv ices. T hey may use more effectiv e advertising  and  marketing  strategies  that  result  in  broader  brand  recognition  and  greater  use,  including  with  respect  to  issuance  and  merchant acceptance.  They  may  also  dev elop  better  security  solutions  or  more  fav orable  pricing  arrangements.  Moreov er,  ev en  if  we  successfully  adapt  to technological change and the proliferation of alternativ e types of payment serv ices by dev eloping and offering our own serv ices in these areas, such serv ices may prov ide less fav orable financial terms for us than we currently receiv e from VisaNet transactions, which could hurt our financial results and prospects.\n\nCertain of our competitors operate with different business models, hav e different cost structures or participate in different market segments. Many of these competitors are also able to use existing payment networks without being subject to many of the associated costs. Moreov er, these competitors also occupy v arious roles in the payments ecosystem that enable them to influence payment choice of other participants. Those business models may ultimately prov e more successful or more adaptable to regulatory, technological and other dev elopments. In some cases, these competitors hav e the support of gov ernment mandates that prohibit, limit or otherwise hinder our ability to compete for transactions within certain countries and regions. Some of our competitors, including American Express, Discov er, priv ate-label card networks, v irtual currency prov iders, technology companies that enable the exchange of digital assets, and certain alternativ e payments systems like Alipay and WeChat Pay, operate closed-loop payments systems, with direct connections to both merchants and consumers. Government actions or initiativ es such as the Dodd-Frank Act, the IFR in Europe, or RTP initiativ es by governments  such  as  the  U.S.  Federal  Reserv e's  FedNow  or  the  Central  Bank  of  Brazil's  Pix  system  may  prov ide  competitors  with  increased opportunities to deriv e competitiv e adv antages from these business models, and may create new competitors, including in some cases the gov ernment itself. Similarly, regulation in Europe under PSD2 and the IFR may require us to open up access to, and allow participation in, our network to additional participants, and reduce the infrastructure inv estment and regulatory burden on competitors. In addition to the open banking prov isions under PSD2, efforts to implement or facilitate open banking and open finance requirements are underway across a number of countries, including Australia, Brazil, Canada and the U.S., which could impose additional requirements on financial institutions or others regarding access to and use of financial data. We also  run  the  risk  of  disintermediation  due  to  factors  such  as  emerging  technologies  and  platforms,  including  mobile  payments,  alternativ e  payment credentials, other ledger technologies or payment forms, and by v irtue of increasing bilateral agreements between entities that prefer not to use our payments network for processing transactions. For example, merchants could process transactions directly with issuers, or processors could process transactions directly with issuers and acquirers.\n\nWe expect the competitiv e landscape to continue to shift and ev olv e. For example:\n\n- We, along with our competitors, clients, network participants, and others are dev eloping or participating in alternativ e payments systems or products, such as mobile payment serv ices, ecommerce payment serv ices, P2P payment serv ices, real-time and faster payment initiativ es, and payment  serv ices  that  permit ACH  or  direct  debits  from  or  to  consumer  checking  accounts,  that  could  either  reduce  our  role  or  otherwise disintermediate  us  from  the  transaction  processing  or  the  v alue-added  serv ices  we  prov ide  to  support  such  processing.  Examples  include initiativ es from T he Clearing House, an association consisting of large financial institutions that has dev eloped its own faster payments system; Early  Warning  Serv ices,  which  operates  Z elle,  a  bank-offered  alternativ e  network  that  prov ides  another  platform  for  faster  funds  or  real-time payments across a variety of payment types, including P2P, corporate and gov ernment disbursement, bill pay and deposit check transactions; and cryptocurrency or stablecoin-based payments initiativ es.\n- Many countries or regions are dev eloping or promoting domestic networks, switches and RTP systems (e.g., U.S., Brazil, India and Europe) and in some countries the gov ernment itself owns and operates these RTP systems (e.g., Brazil). T o the extent these gov ernments mandate local banks and merchants to use and accept these systems for domestic or other transactions, prohibit international payments networks, like Visa, from  participating  on  those  systems,  and/or  impose  restrictions  or  prohibitions  on  international  payments  networks  from  offering  payment serv ices on such transactions, we could face the risk of our business being disintermediated in those countries.

This approach specifically accounts for market risks such as interest rates, equity prices, and volatility. In contrast, BNY Mellon\u2019s 10-K references asset/liability management in general terms without disclosing specific modeling techniques or stochastic projections for policyholder behavior, offering a less detailed view of how market risks like equity or interest rate fluctuations are quantitatively managed.",

      "answer": "The inflationary environment affects AIG by increasing claim volumes, causing adverse effects from exposure to industries like brick-and-mortar retail and commercial office space, and making it more difficult and costly to obtain reinsurance coverage. For BK, the inflationary environment challenges its ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees, which is essential for maintaining competitive advantage in areas such as Securities Services and Investment and Wealth Management. Together, these impacts demonstrate how inflation pressures both companies' operational stability and competitive positioning in the financial sector.",

        "Step 2: From BK's 2023 10-K, extract that the inflationary environment complicates the company\u2019s ability to attract and retain employees, which is critical to maintaining its competitive position across global markets.",

      "question": "How does AIG's reliance on BlackRock for managing $135 billion of its investment portfolio, including $76 billion of Corebridge assets, affect its competitive positioning against BNY Mellon, which emphasizes performance-based investment strategies and faces intense competition in its Investment and Wealth Management business?",
      "answer": "AIG's reliance on BlackRock, which is compensated solely based on the value of assets under management rather than investment performance, may limit AIG's ability to generate strong returns compared to competitors like BNY Mellon that emphasize performance-based strategies. BNY Mellon operates in a highly competitive environment where performance is a key differentiator among investment managers. If BlackRock underperforms due to lack of performance incentives, AIG may struggle to compete effectively in areas such as asset growth, client acquisition, and profitability within the investment management space, where performance track records are critical.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - AIG has $135 billion of its investment portfolio managed by BlackRock, including $76 billion of Corebridge assets, and BlackRock is compensated based solely on asset value, not investment performance.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - BNY Mellon's Investment and Wealth Management business competes intensely with other firms based on factors including performance, and it emphasizes performance as a key competitive differentiator.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - AIG\u2019s asset management model with BlackRock lacks performance incentives, which could lead to suboptimal returns. In contrast, BNY Mellon operates in a performance-driven competitive landscape, suggesting AIG may be at a disadvantage in attracting and retaining clients who prioritize investment performance."

JPMorgan Chase uses collateral obtained under resale and other securities financing agreements, which it is permitted to repledge or otherwise use, indicating active risk management practices tied to these agreements. The combined rationale centers on aligning accounting treatment with the dynamic risk profiles and active management of these instruments, ensuring consistency with market perspectives and reducing volatility in financial reporting.",

This approach is aimed at mitigating refinancing risk and ensuring stable funding sources. In contrast, JPMorgan Chase mitigates credit and liquidity risks in securities financing agreements by closely monitoring the value of underlying securities, requiring initial and ongoing margin levels based on counterparty, security type, and permissible collateral, and maintaining the right to liquidate collateral in case of default.

      "answer": "Both BAC and JPM identify that market dislocations significantly affect their liquidity and capital levels. BAC notes that declines in the fair value of debt securities due to rising interest rates can reduce liquidity levels and negatively impact capital, as their regulatory liquidity position depends on the fair value of assets like AFS and HTM debt securities. JPM highlights that market dislocations can lead to losses on market-making positions, reduced liquidity, and lower capital levels, especially when credit spreads widen and investor confidence erodes. If both institutions experience simultaneous declines in asset values and reduced liquidity access due to correlated market stress, their ability to meet regulatory capital requirements and maintain competitive operations could be severely constrained, increasing systemic risk.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - BAC notes that increases in interest rates adversely impact the fair value of AFS debt securities, which affects accumulated other comprehensive income and capital levels, and that liquidity is dependent on the fair value of AFS and HTM debt securities.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - JPM states that market dislocations can lead to losses on market-making positions, reduced liquidity, and lower capital levels, particularly in environments with widening credit spreads and reduced investor confidence.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both BAC and JPM are exposed to liquidity and capital risks from market dislocations. If interest rate increases and broader market stress simultaneously reduce asset values and limit access to capital markets, both institutions may face compounded constraints on capital adequacy and liquidity, impairing their ability to operate effectively and meet regulatory requirements."

      "question": "How do AIG's and Schwab's adjustments to GAAP financial measures differ in terms of the specific items excluded, and what do these exclusions suggest about the underlying profitability drivers and operational focus of each company?",
      "answer": "AIG excludes items such as changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities, market risk benefits tied to its own credit risk, discount rate changes for long-duration insurance contracts, foreign currency translation adjustments, and deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits from its non-GAAP measures like Adjusted Book Value per Common Share and Adjusted Return on Common Equity. These exclusions highlight AIG's focus on stabilizing its insurance operations by isolating volatile financial instruments and tax-related fluctuations that could distort the perception of its core profitability. In contrast, Schwab adjusts GAAP measures by excluding restructuring costs tied to the integration of TD Ameritrade, indicating a focus on operational streamlining and integration efficiency. Therefore, AIG's adjustments reflect a need to manage financial volatility in its insurance business, while Schwab's adjustments emphasize cost control during post-acquisition restructuring.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, identify AIG\u2019s specific exclusions from GAAP, including fair value changes in securities, market risk benefits, discount rate impacts, foreign currency adjustments, and deferred tax assets.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, extract Schwab\u2019s specific non-GAAP adjustment related to restructuring costs from the TD Ameritrade integration.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the differences in exclusions to infer how each company\u2019s operational structure and strategic priorities influence their choice of non-GAAP measures."

How do these different minimum investment thresholds reflect contrasting market segmentation strategies in their financial planning services as disclosed in their respective 10-K filings?",
      "answer": "AIG's Group Retirement services focus on providing financial planning services in conjunction with employee financial advisors, suggesting a more personalized and potentially higher-touch advisory approach for a broader client base. In contrast, Schwab offers a tiered advisory model that starts with minimum investments as low as $5,000, making financial planning more accessible to a wider range of investors while also offering premium services like Schwab Private Client Services\u2122 for clients with $1 million or more in assets. This reflects Schwab's strategy of market segmentation by wealth levels, providing differentiated services for mass-market investors, affluent clients, and high-net-worth individuals.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AIG provides financial planning services paired with employee financial advisors for Group Retirement clients.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - The difference in minimum investment thresholds reflects contrasting market segmentation strategies: AIG appears to focus on a more uniform advisory approach, while Schwab explicitly segments its market by wealth levels with tiered service offerings."

      "question": "How does the treatment of securities transferred under secured financing arrangements differ between AIG and SCHW, particularly in terms of credit risk management and financial reporting implications?",
      "answer": "AIG actively manages credit risk for Purchased Credit Deteriorated (PCD) RMBS securities by estimating future cash flows and recognizing an allowance for credit losses at the time of purchase, factoring in delinquency rates, expected defaults, and prepayment speeds. These securities are then accounted for under amortized cost. Additionally, AIG pledges securities under secured financing and repurchase agreements, where the pledged collateral is monitored daily and may be repledged by counterparties. In contrast, SCHW reports non-cash investing activity related to securities transferred from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity categories, with a fair value of $188,555 thousand in 2022, but does not disclose active credit risk management practices or allowance estimation for these transferred securities. This indicates a difference in financial reporting focus: AIG emphasizes credit risk provisioning and collateral management, while SCHW emphasizes classification and fair value movement of transferred securities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From AIG's 10-K, extract the process of accounting for PCD securities, including allowance estimation and credit risk inputs such as delinquency rates and expected defaults.",
        "Step 2: From AIG's 10-K, extract the description of secured financing arrangements, including the pledging and potential repledging of securities by counterparties and the daily monitoring of collateral levels.",
        "Step 3: From SCHW's 10-K, extract the specific value of securities transferred from available for sale to held to maturity in 2022, which is $188,555 thousand, and note the absence of any allowance for credit losses or similar risk management disclosures.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize the differences in how each company reports and manages the financial risk associated with transferred securities\u2014AIG with credit loss allowances and active risk evaluation, and SCHW with a focus on classification and fair value without explicit credit risk provisioning."

      "answer": "AIG utilizes both internal and third-party risk assessment tools to manage a variety of insurance risks, including catastrophe exposure and single risk loss events, as part of its broader risk management framework. In contrast, Charles Schwab uses quantitative models and other tools to support investment decisions and processes, particularly in risk assessment and portfolio management, and highlights the potential liability from errors in model design or assumptions. AIG emphasizes modeling techniques like stochastic and deterministic approaches, while Schwab notes the risk of undetected model errors over extended periods leading to fiduciary breaches and financial liabilities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - AIG uses both internal and third-party risk assessment tools to manage insurance risks, including catastrophe exposure and single risk loss events, using stochastic and deterministic modeling techniques.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Charles Schwab uses quantitative models and tools for investment decisions, risk assessment, and portfolio management, with specific concerns about model design errors leading to fiduciary liability.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies rely on risk assessment tools, but AIG focuses on insurance risk modeling, while Schwab emphasizes investment and fiduciary risk management, highlighting different internal and external vulnerabilities."

      "question": "How did Bank of America and Charles Schwab use preferred stock redemptions differently to manage their capital structures in 2024?",
      "answer": "Bank of America redeemed preferred stock as part of a broader capital return strategy, which contributed to a $3.9 billion increase in shareholders\u2019 equity, even after accounting for preferred stock redemptions as a reductionary factor. Charles Schwab, on the other hand, explicitly included preferred stock redemptions as one of several mechanisms\u2014alongside common stock dividends and repurchases\u2014to return excess capital to shareholders, aligning with its capital management goal of maintaining a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of 6.75%\u20137.00% while ensuring regulatory compliance and supporting balance sheet growth.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From BAC_10k_2024.pdf, we learn that preferred stock redemptions were a component of capital returned to shareholders, which partially offset the increase in shareholders' equity of $3.9 billion.",
        "Step 2: From SCHW_10k_2024.pdf, we see that Schwab explicitly lists preferred stock redemptions as a method to return excess capital, in addition to common stock repurchases and dividends, as part of its capital management strategy.",
        "Step 3: Synthesizing both sources reveals that while both firms used preferred stock redemptions, BAC framed it as a capital structure adjustment within a broader equity context, whereas SCHW integrated it into a strategic, policy-driven approach to maintain targeted capital ratios and regulatory compliance."

          "chunk_text": "## Trading Account Liabilities\n\nTrading account liabilities consist primarily of short positions in equity and fixedincome  securities including U.S. Treasury and agency securities, non-U.S. sovereign debt and corporate securities. T rading account liabilities decreased $3.0 billion primarily due to lower levels of short positions within Global Markets .\n\n## Short-term Borrowings\n\nShort-term borrowings provide an additional funding source and primarily consist of Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) short-term borrowings, notes payable and various other  borrowings  that  generally  have  maturities  of  one  year  or  less.  Short-term borrowings increased $11.3 billion primarily due to higher unsecured borrowings to manage liquidity needs. For more information on short-term borrowings, see Note 10  -  Securities  Financing  Agreements,  Short-term  Borrowings,  Collateral  and Restricted Cash to th e Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Long-term Debt\n\nLong-term debt decreased $18.9 billion primarily due to maturities and redemptions,  partially  offset  by  debt  issuances  and  valuation  adjustments.  For more  information  on  long-term  debt,  see Note  11  -  Long-term  Debt to  the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Shareholders' Equity\n\nShareholders' equity increased $3.9 billion primarily due to net income and market value increases on derivatives, partially offset by returns of capital to shareholders through common stock repurchases and common and preferred stock dividends, as well as preferred stock redemptions.\n\n## Cash Flows Overview\n\nThe Corporation's operating assets and liabilities support our global markets and lending  activities.  We  believe  that  cash  flows  from  operations,  available  cash balances and our ability  to  generate  cash  through  short-  and  long-term  debt  are sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs. Our investing activities primarily include the debt securities portfolio and loans and leases. Our financing activities reflect  cash  flows  primarily  related  to  customer  deposits,  securities  financing agreements, long-term debt and common and preferred stock.\n\n## Supplemental Financial Data\n\n## Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nIn  th is  Form  1 0-K,  we  p resent  certain  non-GAAP  financial  measures.  Non-GAAP financial  measures exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP . Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional useful information to assess our financial condition, results of operations (including period-to-period operating  performance)  or  compliance  with  prospective  regulatory  requirements. These  non-GAAP  financial  measures  are  not  intended  as  a  substitute  for  GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as nonGAAP financial measures used by other companies.\n\nWhen presented on a consolidated basis, we view net interest income on an FTE basis  as  a  non-GAAP  financial  measure.  T o  derive  the  FTE  basis,  net  interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with  a  corresponding  increase  in  income  tax  expense.  For  purposes  of  this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 2 1 percent and a representative state tax rate. Net interest yield, which measures the basis points we earn over the cost  of  funds,  utilizes  net  interest  income  on  an  FTE  basis.  We  believe  that presentation of these items on an FTE basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices.\n\nWe may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit valuation adjustment (DV A) gains (losses)), which result in nonGAAP  financial  measures.  We  believe  that  the  presentation  of  measures  that exclude these items is useful because such measures  provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance.\n\nWe  also  evaluate  our  business  based  on  certain  ratios  that  utilize  tangible equity ,  a   non-GA A P  financial  measure.  T angib le  eq uity  rep resents  sh areh old ers' equity or common shareholders' equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)), net of related deferred tax liabilities ('adjusted' shareholders' equity or common shareholders' equity). These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity . In addition, profitability , relationship and investment  models  use  both  return  on  average  tangible  common  shareholders' equity  and  return  on  average  tangible  shareholders'  equity  as  key  measures  to support our overall growth objectives. These ratios are:\n\n-        R e turn  o n  a v e ra ge   ta ngib le   co m m o n  sh a re h o ld e rs'  e q uity  m e a sure s  o ur  ne t income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common  shareholders'  equity .  The  tangible  common  equity  ratio  represents adjusted ending common shareholders' equity divided by total tangible assets.\n-    R eturn on average tangible shareholders' equity measures our net income as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders' equity . The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders' equity divided by total tangible assets.\n-    T angible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders' equity divided by ending common shares outstanding.\n\nWe believe ratios utilizing tangible equity provide additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. T angible book value per common share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock.\n\nThe aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in Tables 6 and 7.\n\nFor  more  information  on  the  reconciliation  of  these  non-GAAP  financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 85.",

          "chunk_text": "## THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\n## Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\n\n## CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\nSchwab seeks to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support execution of our business strategy, inclusive of balance sheet growth over time, financial support to our subsidiaries, sustained access to the capital markets, and regulatory capital requirements. Schwab also seeks to return excess capital to stockholders. We may return excess capital through such activities as dividends, repurchases of common shares, preferred stock redemptions, and repurchases of our preferred stock represented by depositary shares. Schwab's primary sources of capital are funds generated by the operations of subsidiaries and securities issuances by CSC in the capital markets.\n\nTo ensure that Schwab has sufficient capital to absorb unanticipated losses or declines in asset values, we have adopted a policy to remain well capitalized even in stressed scenarios. Internal guidelines are set, for both CSC and its regulated subsidiaries, to ensure capital levels are in line with our strategy and regulatory requirements. Capital forecasts are reviewed monthly at Asset-Liability Management Committee meetings and regularly at meetings of the Board of Directors. A number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify potential developments that could negatively impact capital. In addition, we monitor the subsidiaries' capital levels and requirements. Subject to regulatory capital requirements and any required approvals, any excess capital held by subsidiaries is transferred to CSC in the form of dividends and returns of capital. At the banking subsidiaries, dividends and returns of capital are managed with consideration of minimum tangible common equity and regulatory capital requirements. When subsidiaries have need of additional capital, funds are provided by CSC as equity investments and also as subordinated loans. The details and method used for each cash infusion are based on an analysis of the particular entity's needs and financing alternatives. The amounts and structure of infusions take into consideration maintenance of regulatory capital requirements, debt/equity ratios, and equity double leverage ratios.\n\nSchwab conducts regular capital stress testing to assess the potential financial impacts of various adverse macroeconomic and company-specific events to which the Company could be subjected. The objective of the capital stress testing is (1) to explore various potential outcomes - including rare and extreme events and (2) to assess impacts of potential stressful outcomes on both capital and liquidity (see also Risk Management - Liquidity Risk for discussion of liquidity stress testing). Additionally, we have a comprehensive Capital Contingency Plan to provide action plans for certain low probability/high impact capital events that the Company might face. The Capital Contingency Plan is issued under the authority of the Financial Risk Oversight Committee and provides guidelines for sustained capital events. It does not specifically address every contingency, but is designed to provide a framework for responding to any capital stress. The results of the stress testing indicate there are two scenarios which could stress the Company's capital: (1) inflows of balance sheet cash during a period of very low interest rates and (2) outflows of balance sheet cash when other sources of financing are not available and the Company is required to sell assets at a loss to fund the outflows. The Capital Contingency Plan is reviewed annually and updated as appropriate.\n\nFor additional information, see Business - Regulation in Part I - Item 1.\n\n## Regulatory Capital Requirements\n\nCSC is subject to capital requirements set by the Federal Reserve and is required to serve as a source of strength for our banking subsidiaries and to provide financial assistance if our banking subsidiaries experience financial distress. Schwab is required to maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio for CSC of at least 4%. Due to the relatively low credit risk of our balance sheet assets and risk-based capital ratios at CSC and CSB that are in ex cess of regulatory requirements, the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio is the most restrictive capital constraint on CSC's asset growth.\n\nOur banking subsidiaries are subject to capital requirements set by their regulators that are substantially similar to those imposed on CSC by the Federal Reserve. Our banking subsidiaries' failure to remain well capitalized could result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that could have a direct material effect on the banks. Schwab's principal banking subsidiary, CSB, is required to maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of at least 5% to be well capitalized, but seeks to maintain a ratio of at least 6.5%. Based on its regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2024, CSB is considered well capitalized.\n\nIn July 2023, the Federal Reserve issued a notice of proposed changes to the regulatory capital rules that would require us to include AOCI in regulatory capital, phased in over a three-year transition period, beginning July 1, 2025 (see Current Regulatory and Other Developments). In anticipation of the rules being adopted, the Company's capital management for CSC (consolidated), CSB, and our other banking subsidiaries now incorporates measures that are inclusive of AOCI. During the second quarter of 2024, Schwab updated its long-term operating objective to be its consolidated adjusted Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of 6.75% - 7.00%.

      "answer": "BAC uses the activity-based costing model to allocate both revenue and expense, particularly for indirect compensation and benefits expenses, as well as costs of centralized or shared functions, based on methodologies that reflect utilization. This model is integrated with funds transfer pricing and other assumptions to determine the net income of business segments. In contrast, SCHW applies the activity-based costing model to allocate traditional income statement line item expenses\u2014such as compensation and benefits, depreciation and amortization, and professional services\u2014to specific business activities like client service, opening new accounts, and business development.

Global Markets provides market-making, financing, securities clearing, settlement and custody services globally to institutional investor clients in support of their investing and trading activities. Global Markets product coverage includes securities  and  derivative  products  in  both  the  primary  and  secondary  markets. Global Markets a lso  works  with   commercial and corporate clients to provide risk management products. As a result of market-making activities, Global Markets may be required to manage risk in a broad range of financial products. In addition, the economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily  between Global  Markets and Global Banking under an internal revenuesharing arrangement.\n\n## All Other\n\nAll Other p rim a rily  co nsists  of  A LM   a ctiv itie s,  liq uid a ting  b usine sse s  a nd   ce rta in expenses not otherwise allocated to a business segment. ALM activities encompass interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities for which substantially all of the results are allocated to the business segments. All  Other includes income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking and Global Markets .\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe management accounting and reporting process derives segment and business results  by  utilizing  allocation  methodologies  for  revenue  and  expense.  The  net income derived for the businesses is dependent upon revenue and cost allocations using an activity-based costing model, funds transfer pricing, and other methodologies and assumptions management believes are appropriate to reflect the results of the business.\n\nTotal revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income. The adjustment of net interest income to an FTE basis results in a corresponding increase in income tax expense. The segment results also reflect certain revenue and expense methodologies that are utilized to determine  net  income.  The  net  interest  income  of  the  businesses  includes  the results of a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. In segments where the total  of  lia b ilitie s  a nd   e q uity  e xce e d s  a sse ts,  w h ich   a re   ge ne ra lly  d e p o sit-ta king segments, the Corporation allocates assets to match liabilities. Net interest income of  th e  b usiness  segments  also  includes  an  allocation  of  net  interest  income generated by certain of the Corporation's ALM activities.\n\nThe Corporation's ALM activities include an overall interest rate risk management strategy  that  incorporates  the  use  of  various  derivatives  and  cash instruments to manage fluctuations in earnings and capital that are caused by interest rate volatility . Th e Corporation's goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and  capital.  The  results  of  a  majority  of  th e  Corporation's  ALM  activities  are allocated to the business segments and fluctuate based on the performance of the ALM activities. ALM activities include external product pricing decisions including deposit pricing strategies, the effects of the Corporation's internal funds transfer pricing process and the net effects of other ALM activities.\n\nThe  segment  noninterest  expenses  consist  of  the  same  expenses  as  those shown in the Consolidated Statement of Income and contain both direct expenses and  certain  expenses  not  directly  attributable  to  a  specific  business  segment, including indirect compensation and benefits expenses, that are allocated to the segments.

The SEC's Customer Protection Rule requires broker-dealers to segregate client fully-paid securities and cash balances not collateralizing margin positions and not swept to money market funds or bank deposit accounts. Amounts included in cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes represent actual balances on deposit, whereas cash and investments required to be segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes at December 31, 2024 for CS&amp;Co totaled $38.2 billion. As of January 3, 2025, CS&amp;Co had deposited $1.8 billion of cash into its segregated reserve accounts.

Segment Information\n\nSchwab's two reportable segments are Investor Services and Advisor Services. Schwab structures the operating segments according to its clients and the services provided to those clients. The Investor Services segment provides retail brokerage, investment advisory, and banking and trust services to individual investors, retirement plan and business services, as well as other corporate brokerage services, to businesses and their employees. The Advisor Services segment provides custodial, trading, banking and trust, and support services to independent RIAs, independent retirement advisors, and recordkeepers. Revenues and expenses are attributed to the two segments based on which segment services the client. Schwab's chief operating decision makers (CODMs) are the President and Chief Executive Officer, and the Managing Director and Chief Financial Officer.\n\nThe accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2. For the computation of its segment information, Schwab utilizes an activity-based costing model to allocate traditional income statement line item ex penses (e.g., compensation and benefits, depreciation and amortization, and professional services) to the business activities driving segment expenses (e.g., client service, opening new accounts, or business development) and a funds transfer pricing methodology to allocate certain revenues.",

      "answer": "The inverted yield curve in 2024 created interest rate risk for BAC by increasing uncertainty around monetary policy and potentially reducing net interest income due to narrower spreads between long- and short-term rates. Meanwhile, Schwab experienced a $45.6 billion decrease in average interest-earning assets in 2024, but benefited from a 34% increase in margin loans and a 12% increase in bank lending, which helped sustain net interest revenue despite the inversion. Schwab also saw a $30.1 billion increase in bank sweep deposits and payables to brokerage clients in Q4 2024, supporting a reduction in bank supplemental funding by $29.7 billion for the full year. This dynamic illustrates how the inverted yield curve affected each institution differently based on their asset-liability structure and client behavior.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From BAC's 10-K, the inverted yield curve is cited as a risk factor due to its potential to reduce net interest income and increase uncertainty around monetary policy and asset values.",
        "Step 2: From Schwab's 10-K, the inverted yield curve occurred as short-term rates rose faster than long-term rates through 2022\u20132023, but by year-end 2024, long-term rates rose and short-term rates fell, leading to a normalized yield curve.",
        "Step 3: Schwab's average interest-earning assets decreased by $45.6 billion in 2024, but margin loans increased by 34% and bank lending by 12%, which helped offset some of the negative impacts of the yield curve inversion.",

Any risk factor, either by itself or together with other risk factors, could materially and adversely affect our businesses, results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition.  References  to  third  parties  may  include  suppliers,  service  providers, counterparties,  financial  market  utilities,  exchanges  and  clearing  houses,  data aggregators  and  other  partners  and  their  upstream  and  downstream  service providers (e.g., fourth parties, fifth parties) who may also contribute to our risks. Other factors not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial could also  adversely  affect  our  businesses,  results  of  operations,  cash  flows  and/or financial condition. Therefore, the risk factors below should not be considered all of the potential risks that we may face. For more information on how we manage risks, see Managing Risk in the MD&amp;A beginning on page 45. For more information about the  risks  contained  in  th is  section,  see  Item  1.  Business  b eginning  on  page  2, MD&amp;A  beginning  on  page  26  and  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements beginning on page 94.\n\n## Market\n\n## We  may be adversely affected by the financial markets, fiscal, monetary, and regulatory policies, and econom ic conditions.\n\nGeneral economic, political, social and health conditions in the U.S. and abroad affect financial markets and our businesses. In particular, global markets may be affected  by  the  level  and  volatility  of  interest  rates,  availability  and  market conditions  of  financing,  changes  in  gross  domestic  product  (GDP),  economic growth or its sustainability , inflation, supply chain disruptions, consumer spending, employment  levels,  labor  shortages,  challenging  labor  market  conditions,  wage stagnation, federal government shutdowns, energy prices, home prices, commercial property values, bankruptcies and a default by a significant market participant or class of counterparties, including companies in emerging markets. Global markets also may be affected by adverse developments impacting the U.S. or global banking industry , including bank failures, the failure of nonbank financial institutions and liq uid ity concerns, fluctuations or other significant changes in both debt and equity capital  markets  and  currencies,  the  transition  of  benchmark  rates  to  alternative reference rates, the impact of the volatility of digital assets on the broader market, the rate of growth of global trade and commerce, trade policies, the availability and cost of capital and credit, disruption of communication, transportation or energy infrastructure,  recessionary  fears,  investor  sentiment  and  the  U.S.  and  global election  cycles,  including  stated,  perceived  or  actual  changes  to  policy  and  the geopolitical environment. Global markets, including energy and  commodity markets, may also be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of climate change, acute and/or chronic extreme weather events or natural disasters, the  emergence  of  widespread  health  emergencies  or  pandemics,  cyberattacks, military conflicts, terrorism, or other geopolitical events. Market fluctuations may impact our margin requirements and liquidity.\n\nAny sudden or prolonged market downturn, as a result of the above factors or otherwise, could result in a decline in net interest income and noninterest income and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including capital  and  liquidity  levels.  Elevated   inflation  and   interest  rate  levels,  monetary tightening by central banks, and geopolitical developments, including the Russia/Ukraine  conflict  and  the  conflicts  in  the  Middle  East,  have  adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact financial markets and macroeconomic  conditions,  as  well  as  result  in  additional  market  volatility  and disruptions and recessionary risk.\n\nGlobal uncertainties regarding fiscal and monetary policies present economic challenges. High and rising debt levels in the U.S. and globally may contribute to interest rate volatility , wh ich  may constrain governments' fiscal policies, potentially resulting in adverse economic outcomes. Actions taken by the Federal Reserve or central  banks  in  other  jurisdictions,  including  changes  in  target  rates,  balance sheet management and lending facilities, are beyond our control and difficult to predict, particularly regarding inflation, due to the uncertainty of inflationary paths. This  can  affect  interest  rates  and  th e  value  of  financial  instruments  and  oth er assets, such as debt securities, and impact our borrowers and potentially increase delinquency  rates  and  may  also  raise  government  debt  levels,  adversely  affect businesses and household incomes, adversely impact the banking sector generally , and  increase  uncertainty  surrounding  monetary  policy .  Monetary  policy  has contributed to and may continue to result in elevated market interest rates and a flat  a nd / or  inv e rte d   yie ld   curv e .  A ny  incre a se s  in  p o licy  ra te s,  a s  a   re sp o nse   to inflation persistently above central bank targets, changes to fiscal or trade policies, or otherwise, could result in higher market interest rates. Elevated or rising interest rates may continue to result in volatility of equity and other markets, and volatility of  th e  U .S.  d o lla r ,  w h ich   co uld   im p a ct  inv e sto r  risk  a p p e tite   a nd   o ur  b o rro w e rs, potentially  increasing  delinquency  rates.  Financial  market  volatility  could  also result from uncertainty about the timing and extent of any additional rate cuts by the  Federal  Reserve  in  response  to  moderating  inflation  and/or  weakening economic conditions. Any future change in monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, in an effort to stimulate the economy or otherwise, resulting in lower interest rates would typically result in lower revenue through lower net interest income, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nAlso, changes to existing U.S. laws and regulatory policies and evolving priorities, including those related to financial regulation, taxation, international trade, fiscal policy , climate ch ange (including efforts to transition to a low-carbon economy) and healthcare, may adversely impact U.S. or global economic activity and our clients', our  counterparties'  and  our  earnings  and  operations.  Globally ,  although  many central  banks  have  begun  to  remove  monetary  restriction,  policy  rates  in  many countries remain at elevated levels. While higher interest rates have generally had a positive impact on our net interest income, they have negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact investment securities, deposits, loan demand and funding  costs.  In  addition  to  higher  interest  rates,  wider  credit  spreads  can negatively impact capital and/or liquidity by reducing the value of debt securities. High  and  rising  federal  debt  levels,  investor  concerns  about  the  U.S.  fiscal trajectory , ch anges to fiscal policy and uncertainty about the U.S. budget process could lead to lower investor appetite for U.S. debt securities, higher interest rates and  financial  market  volatility ,  potentially  impacting  broader  economic  activity . Further,  if  th e  U .S.  government's  debt  ceiling  limit  is  not  raised  timely ,  th e ramifications may result in market volatility , ratings downgrades and limit fiscal policy  responses  to  recessionary  conditions.  This  could  have  a  negative  and potentially severe impact on the U.S. and world economy and financial and capital markets, including higher interest rates, higher volatility , lower asset values, lower liq uid ity, d o w ngra d e s to  U .S. d e b t, a nd  a  w e a ke ne d  U .S. d o lla r.\n\nChanges  to  international  trade  and  investment  policies  by  the  U.S.  or  other countries,  and  the  uncertainty  about  potential  changes,  could  negatively  impact financial  markets  globally .

Schwab's interest-bearing liabilities are comprised of bank deposits, which include brokered CDs issued by CSB; payables to brokerage clients; payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations; FHLB borrowings, other short-term borrowings (e.g., commercial paper, repurchase agreements, other secured borrowings); and long-term debt. Schwab deploys the funds from these sources into the assets outlined above. Net interest revenue also includes amounts earned and expenses incurred on securities lending and borrowing activities conducted by our brokerdealer subsidiary using assets held in client brokerage accounts.\n\nAs Schwab builds its client base, we attract new client sweep cash, which is a primary driver of funding balance sheet growth. We do not use short-term, wholesale borrowings to support our long-term investment activity, but may use such funding for short-term liquidity purposes or to provide temporary funding as we have in recent years. Non-interest-bearing funding sources include stockholders' equity, certain client cash balances, and other miscellaneous liabilities.\n\nRevenue on interest-earning assets is affected by various factors, such as the composition of assets, prevailing interest rates and spreads at the time of origination or purchase, changes in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents, floating-rate securities and loans, and changes in prepayment levels for mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities and loans. Schwab establishes the rates paid on client-related liabilities, and management expects that it will generally adjust the rates paid on these liabilities at some fraction of any movement in short-term rates. Interest ex pense on long-term debt, FHLB borrowings, other short-term borrowings, and other funding sources is impacted by market interest rates at the time of borrowing and changes in interest rates on floating-rate liabilities. See also Risk Management Market Risk.\n\nInterest rates increased significantly beginning late in the first quarter of 2022 through the third quarter of 2023. Short-term rates were near zero until the Federal Reserve began an aggressive tightening cycle in March 2022, ultimately increasing the federal funds target overnight rate eleven times between March 2022 and July 2023 for a total increase of 525 basis points. The Federal Reserve maintained the upper bound of the target overnight rate at 5.50% through most of 2024 before reducing the rate by 50 basis points during the third quarter and another 50 basis points across two cuts during the fourth quarter of 2024. Long-term rates increased throughout 2022 and 2023, generally at a slower pace, thus leading to an inverted yield curve. Long-term rates continued to increase during 2024, primarily in the fourth quarter of 2024 while short-term rates declined, resulting in an upward sloping yield curve as of year-end 2024.\n\nAverage interest-earning assets decreased $45.6 billion in 2024 from 2023; however, Schwab saw strong client demand for margin and bank lending, which grew by 34% and 12%, respectively. Even as higher interest rates continued for much of the year, the pace of clients' reallocation of cash from sweep products to higheryielding investment solutions further decelerated in 2024, particularly in the second half of the year. Bank sweep deposits and payables to brokerage clients increased by a total of $9.8 billion, or 4%, during the third quarter, and $30.1 billion, or 11%, in the fourth quarter of 2024, inclusive of typical seasonal cash inflows near yearend. Deceleration of client cash reallocation activity, along with principal and interest payments on the AFS and HTM securities portfolios, supported a reduction in bank supplemental funding of $14.9 billion, or 23%, during the fourth quarter and $29.7 billion, or 37%, for the full year ended December 31, 2024.\n\nSchwab's average interest-earning assets in 2023 were lower compared with 2022, primarily due to clients' reallocation of cash from sweep products to higher-yielding investment solutions in the second half of 2022 and during 2023, which resulted primarily from the rapid increases to the federal funds overnight rate. These changes in client cash allocations reduced average balances of bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients. To support this client cash allocation activity, the Company utilized bank supplemental funding beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022 and throughout 2023, including drawing upon FHLB secured lending facilities, engaging with external financial institutions in repurchase agreements at its banking subsidiaries, and issuing brokered CDs. The average pace of client cash allocation out of sweep products into higher-yielding investment solutions decreased significantly beginning in the second quarter of 2023, and, apart from an increase in August following the Federal Reserve's July rate increase, continued to decline during the second half of 2023. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company saw bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients increase by a total of $17.5 billion, or 5%, due in part to typical seasonal cash inflows near year-end.",

In addition, GRM provides oversight of centralized liquidity and funding management as well as oversight of liquidity management across FLUs and legal entities.  GRM  oversees  the  liquidity  risk  management  governance  structure, establishes  liquidity  risk  policies,  reports  and  monitors  liquidity  risk  limits  and provides  review  and  challenge  of  the  Corporation's  liquidity  risk  management processes.\n\nThe Board, its risk committee and various management committees oversee the Corporation's liquidity activities and risk governance. The Board and/or ERC approve our liquidity risk policy , Financial Contingency and Recovery Plan and liquidity risk appetite  limits.  Management  committees  responsible  for  liquidity  governance include  the  Corporation's  Management  Risk  Committee,  Asset  and  Liability Governance Committee, Liquidity Risk Committee and Asset and Liability Management Investment Committee. For more information, see Managing Risk on page  45.  Under  this  governance  framework,  we  developed  certain  funding  and liq uid ity risk management practices which include: maintaining liquidity at Bank of America  Corporation  (Parent)  and  selected  subsidiaries,  including  our  bank subsidiaries and other regulated entities; determining what amounts of liquidity are appropriate  for  these  entities  based  on  analysis  of  debt  maturities  and  other potential cash outflows, including those that we may experience during stressed market conditions; diversifying funding sources, considering our asset profile and legal entity structure; and performing contingency planning.\n\n## NB Holdings Corporation\n\nBank of America Corporation, as the parent company (Parent), which is a separate and  distinct  legal  entity  from  our  bank  and  nonbank  subsidiaries,  has  an intercompany arrangement with our wholly-owned holding company subsidiary, NB Holdings Corporation (NB Holdings). We have transferred, and agreed to transfer, additional Parent assets not required to satisfy anticipated near-term expenditures to NB Holdings. The Parent is expected to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends, interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service its debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had it not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. These arrangements support our preferred  single  point  of  entry  resolution  strategy ,  und er  wh ich   only  th e  Parent would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\n\nIn consideration for the transfer of assets, NB Holdings issued a subordinated note  to  th e  Parent  in  a  p rincip al  a mount  eq ual  to  th e  value  of  th e  tra nsferred assets. The aggregate principal amount of the note will increase by the amount of any future asset transfers. NB Holdings also provided the Parent with a committed line of credit that allows the Parent to draw funds necessary to service near-term cash  needs.  These  arrangements  support  our  preferred  single  point  of  entry resolution strategy , under which only the Parent would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. These arrangements include provisions to terminate the line of credit,  forgive  th e  subordinated  note  and  require  the  Parent  to  transfer  its remaining  financial  assets  to  NB  Holdings  if  our  projected  liquidity  resources deteriorate so severely that resolution of the Parent becomes imminent.\n\n## Global Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets\n\nWe maintain liquidity available to the Corporation, including the Parent and selected subsidiaries, in the form of cash and high- quality , liquid, unencumbered securities. Our liquidity buffer, referred to as Global Liquidity Sources (GLS), is comprised of assets that are readily available to the Parent and selected subsidiaries, including holding company , bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, even during stressed market conditions. Our cash is primarily on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank and, to a lesser extent, central banks  outside  of  the  U.S.  We  limit  the  composition  of  high-quality , liq uid , unencumbered securities  to  U.S.  government  securities,  U.S.  agency  securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities and other investment-grade securities, and a  select  group  of  non-U.S.  government securities. We can obtain cash for these securities, even in stressed conditions, through repurchase agreements or outright sales.  We  hold  our  GLS  in  legal  entities  that  allow  us  to  meet  the  liquidity requirements of our global businesses, and we consider the impact of potential regulatory ,  tax,  legal  a nd   oth er  restrictions  th a t  could   lim it  th e  tra nsfera b ility  of funds among entities.\n\nTable 15 presents average GLS for the three months ended December 3 1, 202 4 and 2023.\n\n## Table 15 Average Global Liquidity Sources\n\n",

The risk governance structure includes the Board of Directors, designated committees of the Board, and management risk committees.\n\nCSC's Board of Directors sets the tone and culture of effective risk management. The Board has a Risk Committee that assists the Board in setting the type and level of risks that the Company is willing to take and supports the independence and stature of independent risk management. The Board Risk Committee also assists the Board in overseeing and holding senior management accountable for implementing the Board's approved risk appetite, maintaining the Company's risk management and control processes, and managing the Company's activities in a safe and sound manner, and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Board Risk Committee also approves risk appetite statements and related key risk appetite metrics, key risk policies, and reviews information relating to risk issues from functional areas of corporate risk management, legal, and internal audit.\n\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities by reviewing the integrity of the Company's financial statements and financial reporting processes, the qualifications and independence of the independent auditors and performance of the Company's internal audit function and independent auditors, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, processes to assess and manage risk exposures, and other matters as directed by the Board. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors assists the Board in oversight of compensation of the Company's directors, executive officers, and other senior officers. The Board Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assists the Board in its oversight responsibilities regarding Board composition, performance, and developing corporate governance principles, policies, and procedures.\n\nSenior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for risk identification and assessment, risk response, risk measurement and monitoring, and risk reporting and escalation. The Global Risk Committee, which is comprised of senior executives from each client enterprise and support function, is responsible for the oversight of risk management. This includes identifying emerging risks, assessing risk management practices and the control environment, reinforcing business accountability for risk management, supervisory controls and regulatory compliance, supporting resource prioritization across the organization, and escalating significant issues to the Board of Directors. The Chief Risk Officer regularly reports activities of the G lobal Risk Committee to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\nWe have established risk metrics and reporting that enable measurement of the impact of strategy execution against risk appetite. The risk metrics, with risk limits and tolerance levels, are established for key risk categories by the G lobal Risk Committee and its functional risk sub-committees. Functional risk sub-committees focusing on specific areas of risk report to the G lobal Risk Committee. These sub-committees include the:\n\n- Operational Risk Oversight Committee - provides oversight of and approves operational risk management policies, risk tolerance levels, and operational risk governance processes, and includes sub-committees covering Information Security and Cybersecurity, Technology, Fraud, Third-Party Risk, Data Integrity, and Model Governance;\n- Compliance Risk Committee - provides oversight of compliance risk management (inclusive of compliance programs for Schwab's regulated entities, AntiMoney Laundering/Sanctions, Conduct, Fiduciary, Conflicts of Interest, and Privacy), policies, and risk tolerance levels providing an aggregate view of compliance risk exposure and employee conduct, including subcommittees covering Fiduciary and Conflicts of Interest Risk;\n- Financial Risk Oversight Committee - provides oversight of and approves credit, market, liquidity, and capital risk policies, limits, and ex posures and includes the Liquidity and Capital Subcommittee; and\n- New Products and Services Risk Oversight Committee - provides oversight of, and approves new products, including the policy, program, and process designed to oversee new products and services risks prior to and post launch.\n\nSenior management created the Incentive Compensation Risk Oversight Committee to provide oversight of incentive compensation risks and achieve sound incentive compensation risk management practices; it reports directly to the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.",

      "answer": "Bank of America manages commercial credit risk concentrations by evaluating exposures across industry, geography, product, and loan size, and actively mitigates risk through syndications, loan sales, and credit derivatives. This approach reflects in their allowance for credit losses, which increased to $1.8 billion in 2024 due to higher commercial net charge-offs, particularly in the commercial real estate office and U.S. commercial portfolios. In contrast, Charles Schwab segments its loan portfolio into residential real estate, PALs, and other loans, and uses statistical models and collateral maintenance provisions to estimate expected credit losses. Schwab\u2019s methodology for allowance for credit losses focuses on loan-level projections incorporating delinquency roll rates, housing prices, interest rates, and unemployment forecasts, with an emphasis on over-collateralization and daily monitoring in the PALs segment. The difference in concentration risk management leads to Bank of America relying more on external risk transfer mechanisms, while Schwab emphasizes internal collateral control and predictive modeling.",

( 3)\n\n## Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management\n\nCredit risk management for the commercial portfolio begins with an assessment of the credit risk profile of the borrower or counterparty based on an analysis of its financial  position.  As  part  of  th e  overall  cred it  risk  a ssessment,  our  commercial credit exposures are assigned a risk rating and are subject to approval based on defined credit approval standards. Subsequent to loan origination, risk ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis, and if necessary , adjusted to reflect changes in the financial condition, cash flow , risk profile or outlook of a borrower or counterparty . In making credit decisions, we consider risk rating, collateral, country , industry and single-name concentration limits while also balancing these considerations with the  total  borrower  or  counterparty  relationship.  We  use  a  variety  of  tools  to continuously monitor the ability of a borrower or counterparty to perform under its obligations. We use risk rating aggregations to measure and evaluate concentrations within portfolios. In addition, risk ratings are a factor in determining the level of allocated capital and the allowance for credit losses.\n\nAs part of our ongoing risk mitigation initiatives, we attempt to work with clients experiencing financial difficulty to modify their loans to terms that better align with their  current  ability  to  pay .  For  more  information  on  our  accounting  policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming  status and  net charge-offs for  the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Management of Commercial Credit Risk Concentrations\n\nCommercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure continue to be aligned with our risk appetite. We review , measure and  manage  concentrations  of  credit  exposure  by  industry ,  product,  geography , customer  relationship  and  loan  size.  We  also  review ,  measure  and  manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within  our  non-U.S.  portfolio,  we  evaluate  exposures  by  region  and  by  country . Tables 32, 34 and 3 7 summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to  manage the  size  and  risk  profile  of  th e  commercial  credit  portfolio.  For  more information on our industry concentrations, see T able 34 and Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management - Industry Concentrations on page 67.\n\nWe account for certain large corporate loans and loan commitments, including issued but unfunded letters of credit which are considered utilized for credit risk management  purposes,  that  exceed  our  single-name  credit  risk  concentration guidelines  under  the  fair  value  option.  Lending  commitments,  both  funded  and unfunded, are actively managed and monitored, and as appropriate, credit risk for these lending relationships may be mitigated through the use of credit derivatives, with our credit view and market perspectives determining the size and timing of the hedging  activity .  In  ad d ition,  we  p urch a se  cred it  p rotection  to  cover  th e  fund ed portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain other credit exposures. T o lessen the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, credit exposure may be added  within  an  industry ,  borrower  or  counterparty  group  by  selling  protection. These credit derivatives do not meet the requirements for treatment as accounting hedges. They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income.\n\nIn addition, we are a member of various securities and derivative exchanges and clearinghouses,  both  in  the  U.S.  and  other  countries.  As  a  member ,  we  may  be required  to  pay  a  pro-rata  share  of  the  losses  incurred  by  some  of  these organizations  as  a  result  of  another  member  default  and  under  other  loss scenarios. For more information, see Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Commercial Credit Portfolio\n\nOutstanding commercial loans and leases increased $3 7 .1 billion during 202 4 due to growth in U.S. and Non-U.S. commercial, primarily in Global Markets and Global Banking. During  202 4,  commercial  credit  quality  deteriorated  as  reservable criticized  utilized   exp osure  increased  across  a  broad  range  of  industries,  and nonperforming  commercial  loans  increased  primarily  driven  by  U.S.  commercial. Commercial  net  charge-offs  increased  $1.1  billion  to  $1.8  billion  during  202 4 primarily due to higher losses in the commercial real estate office portfolio and U.S. commercial portfolio.\n\nWith the exception of the office property type, which is further discussed in the Commercial  Real  Estate  section  herein,  credit  quality  of  commercial  real  estate borrowers has remained relatively stable since December 3 1, 2023; however, we are closely monitoring emerging trends and borrower performance in a higher interest rate environment.

          "chunk_text": "## THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per S hare Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\n\ntransactions are included in receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations on the consolidated balance sheets. For securities loaned, Schwab typically receives collateral in the form of cash in an amount equal to or greater than the market value of securities loaned; the payables from these transactions are included in payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations on the consolidated balance sheets. In instances where the Company is acting as the lender and receives securities that can be sold or pledged as collateral, the Company recognizes the collateral received at fair value and the obligation to return the collateral in the consolidated balance sheets. The market value of securities borrowed and loaned is monitored and collateral is adjusted to ensure full collateralization. Fees received or paid are recorded in interest revenue or interest ex pense. Schwab applies the practical ex pedient based on collateral maintenance provisions in estimating an allowance for credit losses for securities borrowed receivables.\n\n## Bank loans and related allowance for loan losses\n\nBank loans held for investments are recorded at amortized cost, which is comprised of the contractual principal amounts adjusted for unamortized direct origination costs or net purchase discounts or premiums. Interest income on bank loans is recognized using the effective interest method based on the contractual terms of the loan. Direct origination costs and premiums and discounts are recognized in interest revenue using the effective interest method over the contractual life of the loan and are adjusted for actual prepayments. Additionally, management estimates an allowance for credit losses, which is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to arrive at the amount expected to be collected. The bank loan portfolio includes three portfolio segments: residential real estate, PALs, and other loans. We use these segments when developing and documenting our methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses. The residential real estate portfolio segment is divided into two classes of financing receivables for purposes of monitoring and assessing credit risk: First Mortgages and HELOCs.\n\nSchwab records an allowance for credit losses through a charge to provision for credit losses, included in other revenue, based on our estimate of current expected credit losses for the ex isting portfolio. We review the allowance for credit losses quarterly, taking into consideration current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, the composition of the existing loan portfolio, past loss ex perience, and any other risks inherent in the portfolio to ensure that the allowance for credit losses is maintained at an appropriate level.\n\nSubstantially all PALs are collateralized by marketable securities with liquid markets. Credit lines are over-collateralized and borrowers are required to maintain collateral at specified levels at all times. The required collateral levels are determined based on the type of security pledged. Additionally, collateral market value is monitored on a daily basis and a borrower's credit line may be reduced or collateral may be liquidated if the collateral is in danger of falling below specified levels. As such, the credit loss inherent within this portfolio is limited. Schwab applies the practical ex pedient based on collateral maintenance provisions in estimating an allowance for credit losses for PALs.\n\nThe methodology to establish an allowance for credit losses for the residential real estate portfolio segment utilizes statistical models that estimate prepayments, defaults, and expected losses for this portfolio segment based on predicted behavior of individual loans within the segment. The methodology also evaluates concentrations in the classes of financing receivables, including loan products within those classes, year of origination, and geographical distribution of collateral.\n\nExpected credit losses are estimated using a loan-level model that projects each loan's behavior over its term based on forecasted voluntary housing turnover, the rates of refinancing, delinquency transition rates, and severity of loss. The model takes into account the current relevant risk indicators, including each loan's term and structure, current delinquency status, and the estimated current LTV ratio, as well as borrower FICO scores and current key interest rates including U.S. Treasury, SOFR, Prime, and mortgage rates. The more significant variables in the model include delinquency roll rates, housing prices, interest rates, and the unemployment rate. Delinquency roll rates (i.e., the rates at which loans transition through delinquency stages and ultimately result in a loss) are estimated from our historical loss ex perience over a full economic cycle. Loss severity (i.e., loss given default) estimates are based on forecasted net equity associated with each loan and property, as well as loss ex perience and market trends, both current and forecasted. Housing price trends are derived from historical home price indices and econometric forecasts of future home values. Factors affecting the home price index include housing inventory, unemployment, interest rates, and inflation expectations. Mortgage rates are estimated based on forecasted spread, while the rest of the interest rates used by the model are projected based on the forward rates. The unemployment rate forecast is typically based on the recent consensus of regularly published economic surveys. Linear interpolation is applied to revert to long-term trends after the reasonable and supportable forecast period.\n\nThe methodology described above results in loss factors that are applied to the amortized cost basis of loans, exclusive of accrued interest receivable, to determine the allowance for credit losses for First Mortgages and HELOCs.",

In contrast, BAC, which is subject to CCAR annually, has a SCB requirement of 2.5% effective from October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024.

      "answer": "AXP's subsidiary AENB, with $100 billion or more in assets, is required to submit resolution plans to the FDIC every three years, with a proposed increase to every two years under a new rule. BAC, as a BHC with more than $250 billion in assets, is also required to submit resolution plans to the FDIC and Federal Reserve periodically. The difference in thresholds means that while both are subject to resolution planning, BAC faces more frequent and comprehensive scrutiny due to its larger asset size and systemic importance, which leads to stricter resolvability expectations and potential operational impacts.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AENB (AXP subsidiary) is required to submit resolution plans every three years to the FDIC due to having $100 billion or more in assets, with a proposed change to every two years under a new FDIC rule.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - BAC, as a BHC with more than $250 billion in assets, must periodically submit resolution plans to both the Federal Reserve and FDIC, with more stringent expectations due to its systemic importance.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The asset thresholds ($100B for AENB vs $250B for BAC) determine the frequency and scope of resolution planning obligations. BAC faces more comprehensive regulatory scrutiny due to its larger size and systemic risk profile, which includes international resolution planning and potential restructuring impacts."

      "answer": "AXP, as a Category IV firm, uses the Standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets and is not subject to the Advanced approaches capital requirements. In contrast, BAC and its primary banking affiliate, BANA, are classified as Advanced approaches institutions under Basel III, meaning they use more complex methodologies for calculating risk-weighted assets. Since regulatory capital adequacy is assessed using the approach that yields the lower ratio, BAC's use of the Advanced approach introduces additional complexities that AXP does not face, resulting in different mechanisms for evaluating capital adequacy.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, AXP is a Category IV firm under the Enhanced Prudential Standards and is not subject to Advanced approaches capital requirements, using only the Standardized approach for risk-weighted assets.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, BAC and its affiliate BANA are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel III, which introduces more complex methodologies for calculating risk-weighted assets.",
        "Step 3: Regulatory capital adequacy assessment for BAC considers both Standardized and Advanced approaches, using the lower resulting ratio, whereas AXP only uses the Standardized approach, leading to a divergence in how each firm's capital adequacy is evaluated."

Morgan Stanley, on the other hand, identifies New York as a jurisdiction where it has significant business operations and is subject to tax examinations. Therefore, New York State plays a role in both companies\u2019 disclosures\u2014one through its physical and operational presence as a headquarters location, and the other through its inclusion in tax-related regulatory scrutiny due to substantial business activity.",

      "answer": "Mastercard's forward-looking statements are influenced by global economic, political, financial, and societal events and conditions, including adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls. These macroeconomic factors are cited as potential causes for material differences between actual results and forward-looking statements. Similarly, Morgan Stanley's investment revenues, particularly within its Institutional Securities and Investment Management segments, are directly affected by business, market, economic, and financial conditions. The fair value of investments and performance-based fees, such as carried interest, fluctuate significantly based on these external conditions. Therefore, both companies' financial outcomes and strategic flexibility are constrained by the same macroeconomic environment, creating a shared vulnerability to financial conditions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Mastercard identifies 'global economic, political, financial and societal events and conditions' as a key factor that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Morgan Stanley notes that its 'Investments revenues' and 'Asset management revenues' are significantly influenced by 'business, market, economic and financial conditions' which can cause substantial fluctuations in fair value estimates and performance-based fees.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are exposed to the same macroeconomic conditions, with Mastercard's strategic outlook being sensitive to these conditions and Morgan Stanley's revenue streams directly fluctuating based on them, creating a multi-hop causal relationship through the shared impact of financial conditions."

      "answer": "JPMorgan Chase provides a direct listing of subsidiary guarantors and issuers within its 2023 10-K filing, making this information readily accessible to investors without requiring additional references. In contrast, Wells Fargo incorporates its subsidiary guarantors and issuers information by reference from its Q1 2023 10-Q filing, which creates an additional step for investors to access the full details. This difference in disclosure approach means that investors analyzing JPMorgan's debt guarantee structure have immediate visibility into the subsidiary entities involved, while those assessing Wells Fargo must retrieve and cross-reference prior filings, potentially affecting the efficiency and completeness of their analysis.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from JPMorgan Chase filing - 'Subsidiary Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities' is listed as a direct exhibit (b), indicating it is included in the current 10-K or immediately accessible through referenced documents.",
        "Step 2: Extract from Wells Fargo filing - 'Subsidiary guarantors and issuers of guaranteed securities...' is incorporated by reference from the Q1 2023 10-Q, meaning it is not included directly in the 2023 10-K and must be retrieved separately.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The difference in disclosure formatting affects how easily investors can access and analyze the structure of subsidiary guarantees for each company's debt instruments, with JPMorgan offering more direct access and Wells Fargo requiring additional steps."

      "answer": "Under the Depositor Preference regulation, in the event of insolvency, the claims of the FDIC as receiver and holders of U.S. deposit liabilities have priority over other unsecured creditors for both JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Specifically, at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., this includes U.S. depositors and the FDIC, who are prioritized ahead of non-U.S. branch depositors and public noteholders. Similarly, at Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., insured and uninsured U.S. depositors and the FDIC are prioritized ahead of unsecured creditors, including the Parent company and non-U.S. branch depositors.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to federal law that prioritizes claims of the FDIC and U.S. depositors over other unsecured creditors, including non-U.S. branch depositors and public noteholders.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. is subject to the same Depositor Preference rule, where U.S. depositors and the FDIC have priority in payment over unsecured creditors, including the Parent company and non-U.S. branch depositors.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both banks are subject to the same Depositor Preference regulation, which establishes a clear hierarchy of claims in the event of insolvency, affecting the same categories of entities in a similar manner."

      "question": "How do the capital distribution restrictions under the regulatory capital framework impact both JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo differently in terms of their share repurchase and dividend policies?",
      "answer": "JPMorgan Chase was subject to capital distribution restrictions that limited net repurchases and common stock dividends in the first and second quarters of 2021 to the average of its net income for the four preceding calendar quarters. These restrictions were lifted on July 1, 2021, allowing JPM to resume share repurchases under a $30 billion repurchase program. In contrast, Wells Fargo, as a large bank holding company (BHC), must submit annual capital plans and is subject to Basel III reforms, leverage ratio requirements, and potential capital surcharges due to its designation as a global systemically important bank (G-SIB). Failure to meet these capital requirements could result in limitations or restrictions on its ability to make capital distributions, such as dividends. Thus, while JPM faced temporary restrictions that were later lifted, Wells Fargo faces ongoing regulatory scrutiny and conditional capital distribution limitations tied to its broader compliance with federal capital rules.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - JPM was restricted in Q1 and Q2 2021 to capital distributions not exceeding the average of its net income from the prior four quarters, with restrictions lifted on July 1, 2021, and a $30 billion repurchase program resumed.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Wells Fargo must submit annual capital plans and is subject to Basel III, leverage ratios, and G-SIB surcharges, with failure to meet these requirements potentially leading to distribution restrictions.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - JPM faced temporary restrictions that were lifted, allowing resumption of share repurchases, while Wells Fargo faces ongoing conditional restrictions tied to regulatory compliance, impacting both firms' capital return strategies differently."

      "question": "How does the Prompt Corrective Action framework under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 apply differently to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. in terms of regulatory intervention and capital restoration obligations?",
      "answer": "Under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework, both JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. are subject to mandatory regulatory intervention if they fail to meet minimum capital adequacy standards. However, the application of PCA differs in terms of the specific obligations and regulatory oversight. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. could be required to have its parent, JPMorgan Chase & Co., guarantee the performance of a capital restoration plan if the bank becomes undercapitalized. In contrast, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. operates under a framework where the Federal Reserve may require the parent bank holding company (Wells Fargo & Co.) to act as a source of strength, potentially committing resources to support the bank even in times when the parent may not be in a financial position to do so. Both banks are subject to heightened supervisory actions, but the capital restoration obligations and the role of the parent company differ based on regulatory interpretation and enforcement priorities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to PCA under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, and if undercapitalized, its parent, JPMorgan Chase & Co., may be required to guarantee the capital restoration plan.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. is also subject to PCA, but under the Federal Reserve\u2019s 'source of strength' doctrine, the parent company (Wells Fargo & Co.) may be compelled to support the bank even without available resources.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both banks are subject to PCA, but the mechanism of capital restoration and the enforceability of parent company support differs, reflecting distinct regulatory expectations for each institution."

      "question": "How do the capital distribution restrictions under the Basel III framework and FRB supervision impact the dividend and share repurchase strategies of JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, given their respective disclosures in their 2023 10-K filings?",
      "answer": "The capital distribution restrictions under Basel III and FRB supervision have led both JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo to carefully manage their capital distributions, including dividends and share repurchases. JPMorgan Chase was restricted in the first and second quarters of 2021 by the Federal Reserve, limiting distributions to the average of its net income over the prior four quarters. It also temporarily suspended share repurchases in late 2022 before resuming them in early 2023 under a $30 billion repurchase program. Wells Fargo, as a large BHC subject to Basel III and FRB enhanced supervision, faces similar capital distribution restrictions that could limit its ability to pay dividends if it fails to meet capital requirements. These regulatory constraints force both firms to align their capital return strategies with regulatory expectations and internal capital generation capabilities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From JPM's 10-K, the firm was restricted by the Federal Reserve in Q1 and Q2 2021, limiting distributions to the average of its net income over the prior four quarters, and it temporarily suspended share repurchases in the second half of 2022 before resuming them in Q1 2023 under a $30 billion repurchase program.",
        "Step 2: From Wells Fargo's 10-K, the FRB requires large BHCs to submit capital plans and imposes capital distribution restrictions, including on dividends, under Basel III and enhanced supervision rules. Failure to meet capital requirements could result in limitations on distributions.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize: Both firms are subject to the same regulatory framework (Basel III and FRB supervision), which imposes capital distribution restrictions. These constraints directly influence their dividend policies and share repurchase activities, as seen in JPM's $30 billion repurchase program and Wells Fargo's conditional dividend strategy."

      "answer": "Citi's high volume of securities, trading, derivative, and foreign exchange transactions with financial services counterparties, including banks, insurance companies, and investment banks, exposes it to credit concentration risk, especially when combined with indemnification obligations and potential rapid deterioration in counterparty creditworthiness. Similarly, Goldman Sachs executes a high volume of transactions with financial services entities such as brokers, dealers, and clearinghouses, which has significantly increased its credit concentration risk with these counterparties. Both firms face potential material losses if a major counterparty fails or is downgraded, particularly under regulatory constraints that limit their ability to mitigate these exposures through securitization or hedging, as seen in Citi's Basel III capital model limitations and Goldman Sachs' Dodd-Frank Act-related retention requirements.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Citi routinely executes a high volume of securities, trading, derivative, and foreign exchange transactions with financial services counterparties, including banks, insurance companies, and investment banks, increasing credit concentration risk.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - Citi's Basel III regulatory capital models remain subject to regulatory review, limiting its ability to manage risk-weighted assets and increasing sensitivity to counterparty defaults.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b - Goldman Sachs executes a high volume of transactions with financial services counterparties such as brokers, dealers, and clearinghouses, significantly increasing its credit concentration risk with these entities.",
        "Step 4: Extract from evidence_source_b - Dodd-Frank Act rules limit Goldman Sachs' ability to reduce credit risk by selling or hedging positions, increasing exposure to market stress and counterparty defaults.",
        "Step 5: Synthesize - Both Citi and Goldman Sachs face heightened credit concentration risk due to their high-volume transactional relationships with financial services counterparties. Regulatory constraints (Basel III for Citi, Dodd-Frank for Goldman Sachs) further limit their ability to diversify or hedge these exposures, making both institutions vulnerable to losses from counterparty downgrades or failures."

          "chunk_text": "circumstances, or identify changes in markets or client behaviors not yet inherent in historical data.\n\nCiti could incur significant losses, receive negative regulatory evaluation or ex amination findings or be subject to additional enforcement actions, and its regulatory capital, capital ratios and ability to return capital could be negatively impacted, if Citi's risk management and other processes, including its ability to manage and aggregate data in a timely and accurate manner, strategies or models are deficient or ineffective. For additional information, see the capital return risk factor above and the heightened regulatory scrutiny and ongoing interpretation of regulatory changes risk factor below. Such deficiencies or ineffectiveness could also result in inaccurate financial, regulatory or risk reporting.\n\nMoreover, Citi's Basel III regulatory capital models, including its credit, market and operational risk models, currently remain subject to ongoing regulatory review and approval, which may result in refinements, modifications or enhancements (required or otherwise) to these models. Citi is required to notify and obtain preapproval from both the OCC and FRB prior to implementing certain risk-weighted asset treatments, as well as certain model changes, resulting in a more challenging environment within which Citi must operate in managing its risk-weighted assets. Modifications or requirements resulting from these ongoing reviews, as well as any future changes or guidance provided by the U.S. banking regulators regarding the U.S. regulatory capital framework applicable to Citi, including, but not limited to, potential revisions to the U.S. Basel III rules (see the capital return risk factor and 'Capital Resources-Regulatory Capital Standards and Developments' above), have resulted, and could continue to result, in significant changes to Citi's risk-weighted assets. These changes can negatively impact Citi's capital ratios and its ability to meet its regulatory capital requirements.\n\n## CREDIT RISKS\n\n## Credit Risk and Concentrations of Risk Can Increase the Potential for Citi to Incur Significant Losses.\n\nCiti has credit ex posures to consumer, corporate and public sector borrowers and other counterparties in the U.S. and various countries and jurisdictions globally, including end-ofperiod consumer loans of $393 billion and end-of-period corporate loans of $301 billion at December 31, 2024. For additional information on Citi's corporate and consumer loan portfolios, see 'Managing Global Risk-Corporate Credit' and '-Consumer Credit' below. For information on Citi's credit and country risk, see also each respective business's results of operations above and 'Managing Global Risk-Other Risks-Country Risk' below and Notes 15 and 16.\n\nA default by or a significant downgrade in the credit ratings of a borrower or other counterparty, or a decline in the credit quality or value of any underlying collateral, ex poses Citi to credit risk. Additionally, despite Citi's target client strategy, various macroeconomic, geopolitical, market and other factors, among other things, can increase Citi's credit risk and credit costs, particularly for vulnerable sectors, industries or countries (see the macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties and co-branding and private label credit card risk factors above and the emerging markets risk factor below). For example, a weakening of economic conditions can adversely affect borrowers' ability to repay their obligations, as well as result in Citi being unable to liquidate the collateral it holds or forced to liquidate the collateral at prices that do not cover the full amount owed to Citi.\n\nCiti is also a member of various central clearing counterparties and could incur financial losses as a result of defaults by other clearing members due to the requirements of clearing members to share losses. Additionally, due to the interconnectedness among financial institutions, concerns about the creditworthiness of or defaults by a financial institution could spread to other financial market participants and result in market-wide losses and disruption. For example, the failure of regional banks and other banking stresses in recent years resulted in market volatility across the financial sector.\n\nWhile Citi provides reserves for expected losses for its credit ex posures, as applicable, such reserves are subject to judgments and estimates that could be incorrect or differ from actual future events. For additional information, see the incorrect assumptions or estimates risk factor above.\n\nConcentrations of risk to clients or counterparties engaged in the same or related industries or doing business in a particular geography, or to a particular product or asset class, especially credit and market risks, can also increase Citi's risk of significant losses. For ex ample, Citi routinely executes a high volume of securities, trading, derivative and foreign ex change transactions with non-U.S. sovereigns and with counterparties in the financial services industry, including banks, insurance companies, investment banks, governments, central banks and other financial institutions. Moreover, Citi has indemnification obligations in connection with various transactions that expose it to concentrations of risk, including credit risk from hedging or reinsurance arrangements related to those obligations (see Note 28). A rapid deterioration of a large borrower or other counterparty or within a sector or country in which Citi has large exposures or indemnifications or unexpected market dislocations could lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of other borrowers or counterparties in a certain geography and in related or dependent industries, and such conditions could cause Citi to incur significant losses.\n\n## LIQUIDITY RISKS\n\n## Citi's Businesses, Results of Operations and Financial Condition Could Be Negatively Impacted if It Does Not Effectively Manage Its Liquidity.\n\nAs a large, global financial institution, adequate liquidity and sources of funding are essential to Citi's businesses. Citi's liquidity, sources of funding and costs of funding can be significantly and negatively impacted by factors it cannot control, such as general disruptions in the financial markets; changes in fiscal and monetary policies; regulatory requirements, including changes in regulations; negative investor or counterparty perceptions of Citi's creditworthiness; deposit outflows or unfavorable changes in deposit mix; unexpected increases in cash or collateral requirements; credit ratings; and the consequent inability to monetize available liquidity resources. In addition, Citi competes with other banks",

In addition, deterioration in the credit quality of third parties whose securities or obligations we hold, including a deterioration in the value of collateral posted by third parties to secure their obligations to us, including under derivative contracts and loan agreements,  could  result  in  losses  and/or  adversely  affect  our  ability  to rehypothecate or otherwise use those securities or obligations for liquidity purposes.\n\nA significant  downgrade in the credit ratings of our counterparties could also  have  a  negative  impact  on  our  results.  While  in  many  cases  we  are permitted to require additional collateral from counterparties that experience  financial  difficulty,  disputes  may  arise  as  to  the  amount  of collateral  we  are  entitled  to  receive  and  the  value  of  pledged  assets.  The termination of contracts and the foreclosure on collateral may subject us to claims for the improper exercise of our rights. Default rates, downgrades  and  disputes  with  counterparties  as  to  the  valuation  of collateral typically increase significantly in times of market stress, increased volatility and illiquidity.\n\nAs  part  of  our  clearing  and  prime  financing  activities,  we  finance  our clients'  positions,  and  we  could  be  held  responsible  for  the  defaults  or misconduct  of our clients. Default risk may  arise from  events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee.\n\nConcentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses in our market-making, underwriting, investing and financing activities. Concentration  of  risk  increases  the  potential  for  significant  losses  in  our market-making, underwriting, investing and financing activities.  The number and size of these transactions has affected and may in the future affect  our  results  of  operations  in  a  given  period.  Moreover,  because  of concentrated risk, we may suffer losses even when economic and market conditions are generally favorable for our competitors. Disruptions in the credit  markets  can  make  it  difficult  to  hedge  these  credit  exposures effectively or economically. In addition, we extend large commitments as part  of  our  credit  origination  activities.  Disruptions  in  the  credit  markets have in the past substantially curtailed or eliminated, and may in the future substantially curtail or eliminate, the trading markets for loans  we originate. These disruptions have in the past made, and may in the future make, it difficult for us to sell or value such assets, which have in the past resulted, and may in the future result, in losses for us.\n\nRules  adopted  under  the  Dodd-Frank  Act,  and  similar  rules  adopted  in other  jurisdictions,  require  issuers  of  certain  asset-backed  securities  and any  person  who  organizes  and  initiates  certain  asset-backed  securities transactions to retain economic exposure to the asset, which has affected the  cost  of  and  structures  used  in  connection  with  these  securitization activities.  Our inability to reduce our credit risk by selling, syndicating or securitizing these positions, including during periods of market stress, has in the past negatively affected and may in the future negatively affect our results  of  operations  due  to  a  decrease  in  the  fair  value  of  the  positions, including due to the insolvency or bankruptcy of borrowers, as well as the loss of revenues associated with selling such securities or loans.\n\nIn the ordinary course  of business, we  are at times subject to  a concentration of credit risk to a particular counterparty, borrower, issuer (including  sovereign  issuers)  or  geographic  area  or  group  of  related countries, such as the E.U., and a failure or downgrade of, or default by, such  entity  could  negatively  impact  our  businesses,  perhaps  materially, and the systems by which we set limits and monitor the level of our credit exposure  to  individual  entities,  industries,  countries  and  regions  may  not function as we have anticipated.  Regulatory reform, including the  DoddFrank Act,  has  led  to  increased  centralization  of  trading  activity  through particular clearinghouses, agent banks or exchanges, which has significantly  increased  our  concentration  of  risk  with  respect  to  these entities. While  our  activities  expose  us  to  many  different  industries, counterparties  and  countries,  we  routinely  execute  a  high  volume  of transactions  with  counterparties  engaged  in  financial  services  activities, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, clearinghouses, exchanges  and  investment  funds.

      "question": "How does the change in Citigroup's allowance for credit losses (ACL) methodology for secured financing transactions relate to the $12.15 billion decrease in Goldman Sachs' standardized credit risk-weighted assets (RWAs) from securities financing transactions?",
      "answer": "Citigroup's allowance for credit losses (ACL) methodology for secured financing transactions focuses on the excess of amortized cost over collateral fair value, meaning no ACL is recorded when collateral value equals or exceeds the asset\u2019s carrying amount. This conservative approach likely contributes to reduced credit risk exposure for such transactions. Goldman Sachs reported a $12.15 billion decrease in standardized credit RWAs, primarily driven by reduced exposures in securities financing transactions. The decline in RWAs reflects lower funding exposures, which could be influenced by firms like Citigroup maintaining tighter credit risk controls and lower expected losses on well-collateralized secured financing transactions, thereby reducing overall systemic risk in this category across financial institutions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From Citigroup\u2019s filing, secured financing transactions only require ACL when the amortized cost exceeds the fair value of collateral, and no ACL is recorded otherwise, indicating strong risk mitigation.",
        "Step 2: Goldman Sachs reports a $12.15 billion decrease in standardized credit RWAs, mainly due to reduced exposures in securities financing transactions.",
        "Step 3: The connection lies in how Citigroup's conservative ACL treatment for secured financing transactions contributes to lower credit risk, which aligns with the observed reduction in RWAs at Goldman Sachs, suggesting a broader industry trend of reduced risk in this area."

          "chunk_text": "related uncertainty reserves, as the portfolio delinquencies and losses have increased and these risks are now captured in the quantitative component of the ACL, and (ii) releases related to reserves for specific risks and uncertainties impacting vulnerable industries and regions, partially offset by increases in transfer risk associated with ex posures outside of the U.S., driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law. See 'Accounting Changes' below for information about how the calculation of the quantitative component of the ACL changed in 2024.\n\n## Consumer Loans\n\nFor consumer loans, most portfolios including North America cards, mortgages and personal installment loans (PILs) are covered by the PD, LGD and EAD loss forecasting models. Some smaller international portfolios are covered by econometric models where the gross credit loss (GCL) rate is forecast. The modeling of all retail products is performed by ex amining risk drivers for a given portfolio; these drivers relate to ex posures with similar credit risk characteristics and consider past events, current conditions and R&amp;S forecasts. Under the PD x LGD x EAD approach, GCLs and recoveries are captured on an undiscounted basis. Citi incorporates expected recoveries on loans into its reserve estimate, including ex pected recoveries on assets previously written off.\n\nCECL defines the exposure's expected life as the remaining contractual maturity including any expected prepayments. Subsequent changes to the contractual terms that are the result of a re-underwriting are not included in the loan's expected CECL life.\n\nCiti does not establish reserves for the uncollectible accrued interest on non-revolving consumer products, such as mortgages and installment loans, which are subject to a non-accrual and timely write-off policy at 90 days past due. As such, only the principal balance is subject to the CECL reserve methodology and interest does not attract a further reserve.\n\nFor credit cards, Citi uses the payment rate approach, which leverages payment rate curves, to determine the payments that should be applied to liquidate the end-of-period balance (CECL balance) in the estimation of EAD. The payment rate approach uses customer payment behavior (payment rate) to establish the portion of the CECL balance that will be paid each month. These payment rates are defined as the percentage of principal payments received in the respective month divided by the prior month's billed principal balance. The liquidation (CECL payment) amount for each forecast period is determined by multiplying the CECL balance by that period's forecasted payment rate. The cumulative sum of these payments less the CECL balance produces the balance liquidation curve. Citi does not apply a non-accrual policy to credit card receivables; rather, they are subject to full charge-off at 180 days past due or bankruptcy.\n\nAs such, the entire customer balance up until write-off, including accrued interest and fees, is subject to the CECL reserve methodology.\n\n## Corporate Loans, HTM Securities and Other Assets\n\nCiti records allowances for credit losses on all financial assets carried at amortized cost that are in the scope of CECL, including corporate loans classified as HFI, HTM debt securities and Other assets . Discounting techniques are applied for corporate loans classified as HFI and HTM securities. All cash flows are fully discounted to the reporting date. The ACL includes Citi's estimate of all credit losses ex pected to be incurred over the estimated full contractual life of the financial asset. The contractual life of the financial asset generally does not include ex pected extensions, renewals or modifications. Where Citi has an unconditional option to extend the contractual term, Citi does not consider the potential ex tension in determining the contractual term; however, where the borrower has the sole right to exercise the extension option without Citi's approval, Citi does consider the potential ex tension in determining the contractual term.\n\nThe Company primarily bases its ACL on models that assess the likelihood and severity of credit events and their impact on cash flows under R&amp;S forecasted economic scenarios. Allowances consider the probability of the borrower's default, the loss the Company would incur upon default and the borrower's exposure at default. Such models discount the present value of all future cash flows, using the asset's effective interest rate (EIR). Citi applies a more simplified approach based on historical loss rates to certain exposures recorded in Other assets and certain loan exposures in the Private Bank within Consumer loans .\n\nThe Company considers the risk of nonpayment to be zero for U.S. Treasuries and U.S. government-sponsored agency guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and, as such, Citi does not have an ACL for these securities. For all other HTM debt securities, ECLs are estimated using PD models and discounting techniques, which incorporate assumptions regarding the likelihood and severity of credit losses. For structured securities, specific models use relevant assumptions for the underlying collateral type. A discounting approach is applied to HTM direct obligations of a single issuer, similar to that used for corporate HFI loans.\n\n## Other Financial Assets with Zero Expected Credit Losses\n\nFor certain financial assets, zero ex pected credit losses will be recognized where the ex pectation of nonpayment of the amortized cost basis is zero, based on there being no history of loss and the nature of the receivables.\n\n## Secured Financing Transactions\n\nMost of Citi's reverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowing arrangements and margin loans require that the borrower continually adjust the amount of the collateral securing Citi's interest, primarily resulting from changes in the fair value of such collateral. In such arrangements, ACLs are recorded based only on the amount by which the asset's amortized cost basis exceeds the fair value of the collateral. No ACLs are recorded where the fair value of the collateral is equal to or ex ceeds the asset's amortized cost basis, as Citi does not ex pect to incur credit losses on such well-collateralized ex posures. For certain margin loans presented in Loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, ACLL is estimated using the same approach as corporate loans.",

These investments are integrated with its core global payments network and support its value-added services, such as cyber and intelligence solutions. Visa (V) has also emphasized open banking solutions as one of five categories in its value-added services, focusing on offering network-agnostic services and expanding beyond traditional payments.

      "answer": "MA generates transaction processing assessments based on the number of switched transactions, which include authorization, clearing, and settlement activities on its payment network. These assessments are driven by the volume of data transmitted and the number of authorization and settlement messages processed. In contrast, Visa earns data processing revenue by providing services such as authorization, clearing, and settlement for both Visa-branded and non-Visa-branded card transactions. When processing non-Visa-branded transactions, Visa may provide gateway routing services and earn revenue for the specific services rendered before routing the transaction to another network. Together, MA and Visa facilitate the end-to-end transaction lifecycle by charging fees tied to the scale and complexity of their network services, with MA focusing on switched transaction volume and Visa emphasizing service-based revenue for its global payment infrastructure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - MA earns transaction processing assessments based on the number of switched transactions, which include authorization, clearing, and settlement, and these fees are also influenced by the volume of data and number of messages processed.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Visa earns data processing revenue for providing authorization, clearing, or settlement services, especially in non-Visa-branded transactions where it may act as a gateway before routing to another network.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both MA and Visa play integral roles in the payments ecosystem by offering authorization services and related network functions. Their revenue models reflect the volume and complexity of transactions processed through their networks, with fees structured around data transmission, message volume, and service provision."

      "question": "How do the regulatory investigations involving Mastercard and Visa under the Durbin Amendment reflect differing outcomes in terms of enforcement actions and potential financial implications for each company?",
      "answer": "Mastercard entered into a consent agreement with the FTC regarding its compliance with the Durbin Amendment's debit routing provisions, which required Mastercard to provide PANs for tokenized online debit transactions but did not include a monetary penalty. In contrast, Visa received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) from the FTC and remains under investigation without a finalized resolution. Additionally, Visa faces multiple class-action lawsuits alleging antitrust violations tied to its debit network agreements. These differences suggest that while Mastercard avoided financial penalties through its consent agreement, Visa may face more significant financial exposure due to ongoing litigation and potential damages under the Sherman Act.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Mastercard entered into a consent agreement with the FTC under the Durbin Amendment, which required PAN access for alternative debit routing but imposed no monetary penalty.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Visa received a CID from the FTC under the Durbin Amendment and faces multiple putative class actions alleging antitrust violations under the Sherman Act, with plaintiffs seeking damages and injunctive relief.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The FTC's enforcement approach differed between the two companies: Mastercard resolved its investigation with a non-monetary consent agreement, while Visa remains under investigation and faces private litigation with potential financial consequences."

GS Bank USA must comply with the rule by April 1, 2026, and is required to provide consumers with electronic access to at least 24 months of transaction data and account information without charging fees. Visa, as a service provider to banks issuing Visa-branded consumer credit and debit cards, is also subject to CFPB oversight under this rule, which affects how it handles consumer data access and usage. Both entities must align their data access, accuracy, and retention practices with the rule\u2019s requirements, though the specific compliance mechanisms and timelines differ based on their roles in the financial ecosystem.",

          "chunk_text": "## Privacy and Cybersecurity Regulation\n\nOur  businesses  are  subject  to  numerous  laws  and  regulations  relating  to the privacy of information regarding clients, employees and others. These include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  the  GLB   Act,  the  California  Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (CCPA), the E.U.'s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the U.K.'s Data Protection Act 2018 and U.K. GDPR, the Swiss Federal Data Protection  Act,  the  Japanese  Personal  Information  Protection  Act,  the Personal  Information  Protection  Law  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China, the  Australian Privacy  Act 1988, and India's Digital Personal  Data Protection Act. Generally, privacy laws impose obligations with regard to the  collection,  use  and  disclosure  of  personal  information  and  require public disclosure of privacy practices. Some privacy laws offer individuals certain  rights  about  how  their  personal  information  is  processed,  provide for significant penalties for non-compliance, and, under certain circumstances, impose requirements for transfers of personal data across national borders.\n\nIn 2023, the SEC proposed to amend Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity  (SCI).  The  proposed  amendments  to  Regulation  SCI  would, among other things, expand the types of entities covered by the regulation, require  additional  policies  and  procedures  to  address  cybersecurity  risks, and  require  disclosure  of  additional  types  of  cybersecurity  events  to  the SEC.\n\nIn 2024, the SEC amended Regulation S-P that implements the GLB Act. The  amendments  to  Regulation  S-P  require  broker-dealers,  investment companies  and  investment  advisers  registered  with  the  SEC  to  adopt written policies and procedures for incident response programs to address unauthorized  access  to  or  use  of  customer  information.  The  amended Regulation S-P requires covered entities to notify within 30 days individuals affected by an incident involving sensitive customer information  and  provide  them  with  details  about  the  incident  and  other information  intended  to  help  affected  individuals  respond  appropriately. Larger covered entities, such as GS&amp;Co., will have until December 2025, and smaller covered entities will have until June 2026, to comply with the amended  Regulation  S-P.  In  2024,  the  California  Privacy  Protection Agency  proposed  regulations  under  the  CCPA  relating  to  cybersecurity audits, risk assessments, and automated decision-making technology.\n\nOur  businesses are also subject to laws and regulations  governing cybersecurity and related risks, and which require regulatory disclosures, and, in some instances, individual disclosures, of certain security incidents. These include, but are not limited to, the NYDFS Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies. The NYDFS  also requires financial institutions regulated by the NYDFS, including GS Bank USA,  to,  among  other  things,  (i)  establish  and  maintain  a  cybersecurity program designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of their information systems; (ii) implement and maintain a written cybersecurity policy setting forth policies and procedures for the protection  of  their  information  systems  and  nonpublic  information;  and (iii)  designate a  Chief  Information  Security  Officer.  In 2023, the  NYDFS adopted  amendments  to  its  cybersecurity  regulations  that  will  impose heightened or additional requirements with respect to cybersecurity incident  notifications,  risk  management  and  governance.  Most  of  these amendments became effective in 2024 although certain amendments have a longer transition period and become effective in 2025.\n\nIn  2023,  the  E.U.  Digital  Operational  Resilience  Act  (DORA)  became effective  and  applies  from  January  2025.  DORA  requires  E.U.  financial entities, such as GSBE, to have a comprehensive governance and control framework  for  the  management  of  information  and  communications technology  risk.  In  addition,  in  2024,  the  E.U. Artificial  Intelligence  Act (E.U.  AI  Act)  became  effective.  Certain  provisions  of  the  E.U.  AI  Act apply from February 2025, with other provisions applying between August 2025 and August 2027. The E.U. AI Act establishes rules for placing on the market, putting into service, and using artificial intelligence systems in the E.U.\n\nIn 2024, the CFPB adopted a rule regarding personal financial data rights that  requires  financial  institutions  that  offer  consumer  deposit  accounts and  issue  credit  cards,  such  as  GS  B ank  USA,  to  provide  consumers electronic  access  to  at  least  24  months  of  transaction  data  and  certain account information and are prohibited from imposing any fees or charges for  maintaining  or  providing  access  to  such  data.  The  rule  also  imposes data accuracy, retention and other obligations, and data use limitations and other  obligations  on  entities  obtaining  access  to  such  personal  financial data, such as GS&amp;Co. The current compliance deadline for large financial institutions,  including  GS  B ank  USA,  is  April  1,  2026.  However,  this timeline  is  potentially  subject  to  change  as  a  result  of  CFPB   action  or currently pending litigation.\n\nSee  'Management's  Discussion  and Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and Results of Operations  -  Risk Management  -  Cybersecurity Risk Management' in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for further information about our cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance.",

In addition, legislatures and regulators globally are proposing new laws or regulations  on  these  topics  that  could  require  Visa  to  adopt  more  restrictiv e  data  collection  and  processing  practices;  expand  cybersecurity requirements; limit  cross-border  data  flows;  impact  the  adoption  of  adv anced AI  systems;  and  impose  increased  obligations  on  companies  handling personal data.\n\nSupervisory Oversight of the Payments Industry: Visa is subject to financial sector ov ersight and regulation in substantially all of the jurisdictions in which we operate. In the U.S., for example, the Federal Banking Agencies (FBA) (formerly known as the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council)  has  superv isory  ov ersight  ov er  Visa  under  applicable  federal  banking  laws  and  policies  as  a  technology  serv ice  prov ider  to  U.S.  financial institutions.  T he  federal  banking  agencies  comprising the  FBA are the  Federal  Reserv e  Board, the  Comptroller of the  Currency, the  Federal  Deposit Insurance  Corporation  and  the  National  Credit  Union Administration.  Visa  may  also  be  separately  examined  by  the  Consumer  Financial  Protection Bureau  (CFPB)  as  a  serv ice  prov ider  to  the  banks  that  issue  Visa-branded  consumer  credit  and  debit  card  products.  Central  banks  in  other countries/regions, including Canada, Europe, India, Ukraine and the UK (as discussed below), hav e recognized or designated Visa as a retail payment system  under  v arious  types  of  financial  stability  regulations.  Visa  is  also  subject  to  ov ersight  by  banking  and  financial  sector  authorities  in  other jurisdictions, such as Brazil and Hong Kong.\n\nEuropean  and  United  Kingdom  Regulations  and  Supervisory  Oversight: Visa  in  Europe  continues  to  be  subject  to  complex  and  ev olv ing regulation in the EEA and the UK.\n\nThere are a number of EU regulations that impact our business. As discussed abov e, the IFR regulates interchange rates within the EEA, requires Visa Europe to separate its payment card scheme activ ities from processing activ ities for accounting, organization and decision-making purposes within the  EEA, and imposes limitations on network exclusiv ity and routing.  National competent authorities in the  EEA are responsible for monitoring and enforcing the  IFR in their markets.  We are also subject to regulations gov erning areas such as priv acy and data protection, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism and sanctions. Other regulations in Europe, such as the second Payment Serv ices Directiv e (PSD2), require, among other things,  that  our  financial  institution  clients  prov ide  certain  customer  account  access  rights  to  emerging  non-financial  institution  players.  PSD2  also includes  strong  customer  authentication  requirements  for  certain  transactions  that  could  impose  both  operational  complexity  on  Visa  and  impact consumer payment experiences. Visa Europe is also subject to superv isory ov ersight by the European Central Bank and certain competent authorities in Europe.\n\nIn the UK, Visa Europe is designated as a Recognized Payment System, bringing it within the scope of the Bank of England's superv isory powers and subjecting it to v arious requirements, including on issues such as gov ernance and risk management designed to maintain the stability of the UK's financial system. Visa Europe is also regulated by the UK's Payment Systems Regulator (PSR), which has wide-ranging powers and authority to rev iew our business practices, systems, rules and fees with respect to promoting competition and innov ation in the UK, and ensuring payment systems take care of, and promote, the interests of serv ice-users. T he PSR recently established a superv isory team to specifically ov ersee payment system operators like Visa in the aforementioned areas. Post-Brexit, the UK has adopted v arious European regulations, including regulations that impact the payments ecosystem, such as the IFR and PSD2. The PSR is responsible for monitoring Visa Europe's compliance with the IFR as adopted in the UK.\n\nCorporate  Responsibility  and  Sustainability: Certain gov ernments around the world are adopting laws and regulations pertaining to corporate responsibility  and  sustainability  performance,  transparency  and  reporting.  Regulations  may  include  mandated  corporate  reporting  (e.g.,  Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directiv e) or in indiv idual areas, such as mandated reporting on climate-related financial disclosures.\n\nAdditional  Regulatory  Developments: Various regulatory agencies across the world also continue to examine a wide v ariety of other issues, including  mobile  payment  transactions,  tokenization,  access  rights  for  non-financial  institutions,  money  transfer  serv ices,  identity  theft,  account management  guidelines,  disclosure  rules,  security  and  marketing  that  could  affect  our  financial  institution  clients  and  our  business.  Furthermore, following the passage of PSD2 in Europe, sev eral countries, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Hong Kong and Mexico, are contemplating granting or have already granted v arious types of access rights to third-party processors, including access to consumer account data maintained by our financial institution clients.

Market  makers and investment professionals in our revenue-producing units are responsible for pricing our financial instruments. Our control infrastructure is independent of the revenue-producing units and is fundamental to ensuring that all of our financial instruments are appropriately valued at market-clearing levels.  In the event that there is a difference  of  opinion  in  situations  where  estimating  the  fair  value  of financial instruments requires judgment (e.g., calibration to market comparables or trade comparison, as described below), the final valuation decision is made by senior managers in our independent price verification function  within  Controllers.  This  independent  price  verification  is  critical to ensuring that our financial instruments are properly valued.\n\nPrice  Verification. All  financial  instruments  at  fair  value  classified  in levels 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy are subject to our independent price verification process. The objective of price verification is to have an informed and independent opinion with regard to the valuation of financial instruments under review.  Instruments that have one or more significant inputs which cannot be corroborated by external market data are classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Price verification strategies utilized by our independent price verification function within Controllers include:\n\n- Trade Comparison. Analysis of trade data (both internal and external, where  available)  is  used  to  determine  the  most  relevant  pricing  inputs and valuations.\n- External  Price  Comparison. V aluations  and  prices  are  compared  to pricing  data  obtained  from  third  parties  (e.g.,  brokers  or  dealers,  S&amp;P Global Services, Bloomberg, ICE Data Services, Pricing Direct, TRACE).  Data  obtained  from  various  sources  is  compared  to  ensure consistency  and  validity.  When  broker  or  dealer  quotations  or  thirdparty pricing vendors are used for valuation or price verification, greater priority is generally given to executable quotations.\n- Calibration  to  Market  Comparables. Market-based  transactions  are used to corroborate the valuation of positions with similar characteristics, risks and components.\n- Relative Value Analyses. Market-based  transactions  are  analyzed  to determine the similarity, measured in terms of risk, liquidity and return, of one instrument relative to another or, for a given instrument, of one maturity relative to another.\n- Collateral  Analyses. Margin  calls on  derivatives are analyzed  to determine implied values, which are used to corroborate our valuations.\n- Execution  of  Trades. Where  appropriate,  market-making  desks  are instructed  to  execute  trades  in  order  to  provide  evidence  of  marketclearing levels.\n- Backtesting. Valuations  are  corroborated  by  comparison  to  values realized upon sales.\n\nSee Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about fair value measurements.\n\nReview of Net Revenues. We seek to ensure adherence to our pricing policy through a combination of daily procedures, including the explanation  and  attribution  of  net  revenues  based  on  the  underlying factors.  Through  this  process,  we  independently  validate  net  revenues, identify and resolve potential fair value or trade booking issues on a timely basis  and  seek  to  ensure  that  risks  are  being  properly  categorized  and quantified.\n\nReview of Valuation Models. Our independent model risk management group  (Model  Risk),  consisting  of  quantitative  professionals  who  are separate  from  model  developers,  performs  an  independent  model  review and validation  process  of  our  valuation  models.  New  or  changed  models are reviewed and approved prior to implementation. Models are reviewed annually to assess the impact of any changes in the product or market and any  market  developments  in  pricing  theories.  See  'Risk  Management  Model  Risk  Management'  for  further  information  about  the  review  and validation of our valuation models.\n\n## Allowance for Credit Losses\n\nWe estimate and record an allowance for credit losses related to our loans held for investment that are accounted for at amortized cost. To determine the  allowance  for  credit  losses,  we  classify  our  loans  accounted  for  at amortized  cost  into  wholesale  and  consumer  portfolios.  These  portfolios represent  the  level  at  which  we  have  developed  and  documented  our methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The allowance for  credit  losses  is  measured  on  a  collective  basis  for  loans  that  exhibit similar  risk  characteristics  using  a  modeled  approach  and  on  an  assetspecific basis for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics.",

In addition, we are subject to economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in the U.S. Therefore, we do not permit financial institutions or other entities that are domiciled in countries or territories subject to comprehensiv e OFAC trade sanctions (currently, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Crimea and the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic regions of Ukraine), or that are included on OFAC's list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, to issue or acquire Visa cards or engage in transactions using our products and serv ices.\n\nGovernment-imposed Market Participation Restrictions: Certain  gov ernments,  including  China,  India,  Indonesia,  T hailand  and  Vietnam,  hav e taken actions to promote domestic payments systems and/or certain issuers, payments networks or processors, by imposing regulations that fav or domestic prov iders, impose local ownership requirements on processors, require data localization or mandate that domestic processing be done in that country.\n\nInterchange  Rates  and  Fees: An  increasing  number  of  jurisdictions  around  the  world  regulate  or  influence  debit  and  credit  interchange reimbursement rates in their regions. For example, the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Act (Dodd-Frank Act) limits interchange reimbursement rates for certain debit card transactions in the U.S.; the European Union (EU) IFR limits interchange rates in the European Economic Area (EEA) (as discussed below); and the Reserv e Bank of Australia (RBA) regulates av erage permissible lev els of interchange.\n\nInternet Transactions: Many jurisdictions hav e adopted regulations that require payments system participants to monitor, identify, filter, restrict or take other actions with regard to certain types of payment transactions on the Internet, such as gambling, digital currencies, the purchase of cigarettes or alcohol and other controv ersial transaction types.\n\nNetwork Exclusivity and Routing: In the U.S., the Dodd-Frank Act limits network exclusiv ity and restrictions on merchant routing choice for the debit and prepaid market segments. Other jurisdictions impose similar limitations, such as the IFR's prohibition in Europe on restrictions that prev ent multiple payment brands or functionality on the same card.\n\nNo-surcharge  Rules: We have historically enforced rules that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using Visa products instead of other means. Howev er, merchants' ability to surcharge v aries by geographic market as well as Visa product type, and continues to be impacted by litigation, regulation and legislation.",

      "question": "Given Visa's indemnification obligations for settlement losses and Goldman Sachs' exposure to credit risk from third-party defaults, how might concurrent settlement failures among financial institutions create overlapping liquidity risks for both companies, particularly considering Visa's exposure to unsettled payment transactions and Goldman Sachs' involvement in derivative transactions with delayed settlements?",
      "answer": "Both companies face liquidity risks from settlement failures, but the mechanisms differ. Visa indemnifies issuers and acquirers for settlement losses, with exposure limited to the amount of unsettled Visa card payment transactions at any point in time. Concurrent settlement failures or insolvencies involving multiple clients could expose Visa to significant liquidity risk. Similarly, Goldman Sachs notes that derivative transactions and delayed documentation or settlements expose them to credit risk and potential losses. If these risks materialize concurrently\u2014particularly if both firms share exposure to the same counterparties experiencing financial distress\u2014the combined effect could strain liquidity for both institutions. While the connection is not explicitly stated, the shared vulnerability to settlement failures suggests a potential amplification of liquidity stress under adverse conditions.",

As  a  result  of  any  of  these  factors,  any  decline  in  cross-border  trav el  and  spend  would  impact  our  cross-border volumes,  the  number  of  cross-border  transactions  we  process  and  our  currency  exchange  activ ities,  which  in  turn  would  reduce  our  international transaction rev enue.\n\n## Our aspirations to address corporate responsibility and sustainability (CRS) matters and considerations could adversely affect our business and financial results or negatively impact our reputation.\n\nWe are subject to laws, regulations and other measures that gov ern a wide range of topics, including those that are related to matters beyond our core products and serv ices, such as matters that touch upon sustainability, climate change, human capital, inclusion and div ersity, and human rights. A wide range of stakeholders, including gov ernments, customers, employees, and inv estors, are increasingly focused on and are dev eloping expectations regarding  these  corporate  responsibility  matters.  We  hav e  established  CRS-related  initiativ es,  adopted  reporting  frameworks,  and  announced  sev eral related  goals.  T hese  goals  may  change  from  time  to  time,  implementation  of  these  goals  may  require  considerable  inv estments,  and  ultimately,  we cannot guarantee that we will achiev e them.\n\nOur  ability  to  achiev e  any  CRS  objectiv es  is  subject  to  numerous  risks,  many  of  which  are  outside  of  our  control,  including  the  ev olv ing  legal environment and regulatory requirements for the tracking and reporting of CRS standards or disclosures and the actions of suppliers, partners, and other third parties. Certain of our regulators hav e proposed or adopted, or may propose or adopt, rules or standards related to these matters that would apply to our business. New regulations hav e been enacted and/or are expected in sev eral jurisdictions, including the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directiv e, the SEC climate-related disclosures that could require disclosure of climate-related information and the State of California's legislation requiring broad  disclosure  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  other  climate-related  information.  Prev ailing  CRS  standards  and  expectations  may  also  reflect conflicting v alues or objectiv es, which can result in our practices being judged by standards that are continually ev olv ing and are not always clear. From time to time, the methodologies for reporting our CRS data may be updated and prev iously reported data may be adjusted to reflect an improv ement in the av ailability and quality of data, changing assumptions, changes in the nature and scope of our operations, and other changes in circumstances. This may result in  a  lack  of  consistent  or  meaningful  comparativ e  data  from  period  to  period  or  between  us  and  other  companies  in  the  same  industry. Further,  where  new  laws  or  regulations  are  more  stringent  than  current  legal  or  regulatory  requirements,  we  may  experience  increased  compliance burdens and costs to meet such obligations.\n\nOur stakeholders often hold differing v iews on our CRS-related goals and initiativ es, which may result in negativ e attention in traditional and social media  or  a  negativ e  perception  of  our  response  to  concerns  regarding  these  matters.  In  addition,  we  also  face  potentially  conflicting  superv isory directiv es as certain U.S. regulatory and non-U.S. authorities hav e prioritized CRS-related issues while Congress and certain U.S. state gov ernments have  signaled  pursuing  potentially  conflicting  priorities.  T hese  circumstances,  among  others,  may  result  in  pressure  from  inv estors,  unfav orable reputational  impacts,  including  inaccurate  perceptions  or  a  misrepresentation  of  our  actual  CRS  practices,  div ersion  of  management's  attention  and resources, and proxy fights, among other material adv erse impacts on our business. Any failure, or perceiv ed failure, by us to adhere to our public statements,  comply  fully  with  dev eloping  interpretations  of  CRS  laws  and  regulations,  or  meet  ev olv ing  and  v aried  stakeholder  expectations  and standards could negativ ely impact our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\n\n## Our indemnification obligation to fund settlement losses of our clients exposes us to significant risk of loss and may reduce our liquidity.\n\nWe indemnify issuers and acquirers for settlement losses they may suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to honor its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. In certain instances, we may indemnify issuers or acquirers in situations in which a transaction is  not  processed  by  our  system.  T his  indemnification  creates  settlement  risk  for  us  due  to  the  timing  difference  between  the  date  of  a  payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Our indemnification exposure is generally limited to the amount of unsettled Visa card payment transactions at any point in time and any subsequent amounts that may fall due relating to adjustments for prev iously processed transactions.

However,  management  believes  that  it  is  unlikely  the firm will have to make any material payments under these arrangements, and no material liabilities  related  to  these  guarantees  and  indemnifications have  been  recognized  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  as  of  both December 2024 and December 2023.\n\nOther Representations, Warranties and Indemnifications. The  firm provides  representations  and  warranties  to  counterparties  in  connection with  a  variety  of  commercial  transactions  and  occasionally  indemnifies them against potential losses caused by the breach of those representations and  warranties.  The  firm  may  also  provide  indemnifications  protecting against  changes  in  or  adverse  application  of  certain  U.S.  tax  laws  in connection with ordinary-course transactions, such as securities issuances, borrowings or derivatives.\n\nIn addition, the firm may provide indemnifications to some counterparties to  protect  them  in  the  event  additional  taxes  are  owed  or  payments  are withheld,  due  either  to  a  change  in  or  an  adverse  application  of  certain non-U.S.  tax  laws.  These  indemnifications,  as  well  as  indemnifications provided  by  the  firm  on  other  contractual  or  other  obligations,  generally are standard contractual terms and are entered into in the ordinary course of business. Generally, there are no stated or notional amounts included in these  indemnifications,  and  the  contingencies  triggering  the  obligation  to indemnify are not expected to occur. Future changes in tax laws and how such  laws  would  apply  to  these  indemnifications  cannot  be  determined.

Property, equipment and technology are recorded at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, which are computed on a straight-line basis ov er the asset's estimated useful life. Depreciation and amortization of technology, furniture, fixtures and equipment are computed ov er estimated useful liv es ranging from 2 to 10 years. Leasehold improv ements are amortized ov er the shorter of the useful life of the asset or lease term. Building improv ements are depreciated between 3 and 40 years, and buildings are depreciated ov er 40 years.

See Note 7-Property, Equipment and Technology, Net .\n\nLeases . The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at its inception. Right-of-use (ROU) assets, and corresponding lease liabilities, are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments ov er the lease term. For this purpose, the Company considers only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement. As a majority of the  Company's leases do not prov ide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information av ailable at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The ROU asset also includes any lease payments made prior to commencement and is recorded net of any lease incentiv es receiv ed.  T he  lease  terms  may  include  options  to  extend  or  terminate  the  lease  when  it  is  reasonably  certain  that  the  Company  will  exercise  such options. The Company does not record a ROU asset and corresponding liability for leases with terms of 12 months or less.\n\nLease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components primarily include payments for maintenance and utilities.  T he  Company  does  not  combine  lease  payments with non-lease components for any of its leases.

      "answer": "Goldman Sachs states it is unable to estimate the maximum payout under its indemnifications due to dependence on future events, and it does not recognize any material liabilities for these arrangements on its balance sheet. In contrast, Visa quantifies its maximum daily settlement exposure at $137.4 billion for fiscal 2024 and maintains $7.7 billion in collateral as of September 30, 2024, to mitigate this risk. This implies that Visa actively manages and prepares for settlement indemnification risk with measurable collateral, while Goldman Sachs treats its indemnification liabilities as uncertain and non-material, relying on management's belief that material payments are unlikely.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Goldman Sachs cannot estimate maximum payout under indemnifications and does not recognize material liabilities for them.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Visa's maximum daily settlement exposure was $137.4 billion in fiscal 2024, with $7.7 billion in collateral held as of September 30, 2024.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The difference in approach reflects distinct risk mitigation strategies: Visa actively quantifies and collateralizes its indemnification exposure, while Goldman Sachs treats its exposure as uncertain and unlikely to result in material liability."

AN D  SU BSID IAR IE S\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe firm is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum payout under these guarantees and indemnifications as this depends upon the occurrence of future events, including an assessment of claims that have not  yet  occurred.  However,  management  believes  that  it  is  unlikely  the firm will have to make any material payments under these arrangements, and no material liabilities  related  to  these  guarantees  and  indemnifications have  been  recognized  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  as  of  both December 2024 and December 2023.\n\nOther Representations, Warranties and Indemnifications. The  firm provides  representations  and  warranties  to  counterparties  in  connection with  a  variety  of  commercial  transactions  and  occasionally  indemnifies them against potential losses caused by the breach of those representations and  warranties.  The  firm  may  also  provide  indemnifications  protecting against  changes  in  or  adverse  application  of  certain  U.S.  tax  laws  in connection with ordinary-course transactions, such as securities issuances, borrowings or derivatives.\n\nIn addition, the firm may provide indemnifications to some counterparties to  protect  them  in  the  event  additional  taxes  are  owed  or  payments  are withheld,  due  either  to  a  change  in  or  an  adverse  application  of  certain non-U.S.  tax  laws.  These  indemnifications,  as  well  as  indemnifications provided  by  the  firm  on  other  contractual  or  other  obligations,  generally are standard contractual terms and are entered into in the ordinary course of business. Generally, there are no stated or notional amounts included in these  indemnifications,  and  the  contingencies  triggering  the  obligation  to indemnify are not expected to occur. Future changes in tax laws and how such  laws  would  apply  to  these  indemnifications  cannot  be  determined. Therefore,  the  firm  is  unable  to  develop  an  estimate  of  the  maximum payout under these guarantees and indemnifications. However, management  believes  that  it  is  unlikely  the  firm  will  have  to  make  any material  payments  under  these  arrangements,  and  no  material  liabilities related  to  these  arrangements  have  been  recognized  in  the  consolidated balance sheets as of both December 2024 and December 2023.\n\nGuarantees  of  Subsidiaries. Group  Inc.  is  the  entity  that  fully  and unconditionally  guarantees  the  securities  issued  by  GS  Finance  Corp.,  a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of the firm.  Group  Inc. has guaranteed the  payment  obligations  of  Goldman  Sachs  &amp;  Co.  LLC  (GS&amp;Co.),  GS Bank  USA  and  Goldman  Sachs  Paris  Inc.  et  Cie,  subject  to  certain exceptions. Group Inc. also guarantees many of the obligations of its other consolidated subsidiaries on a transaction-by-transaction basis, as negotiated  with  counterparties.  In  addition,  Group  Inc.  has  provided guarantees  to  Goldman  Sachs  International  (GSI)  and  GSBE  related  to agreements that each entity has entered into with certain of its counterparties.  Given  the  obligations  of  the  consolidated  subsidiaries  are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets or reflected as commitments,  Group  Inc.'s  liabilities  as  guarantor  are  not  separately disclosed.\n\n## Note 19.\n\n## Shareholders' Equity\n\n## Common Equity\n\nAs of both December 2024 and December 2023, the firm had 4.00 billion authorized shares of common stock and 200 million authorized shares of nonvoting common stock, each with a par value of $0.01 per share.\n\nThe  firm's  share  repurchase  program  is  intended  to  help  maintain  the appropriate  level  of  common  equity.  The  share  repurchase  program  is effected  primarily  through  regular  open-market  purchases  (which  may include  repurchase  plans  designed  to  comply  with  Rule  10b5-1  and accelerated  share  repurchases),  the  amounts  and  timing  of  which  are determined primarily by the firm's current and projected capital position, and capital deployment opportunities, but which may also be influenced by the evolution of current and future regulatory capital requirements, general market  conditions  and  the  prevailing  price  and  trading  volumes  of  the firm's common stock.\n\nThe table below presents information about common stock repurchases.\n\n",

T his indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement.  The  Company maintains and regularly rev iews global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. Historically, the Company has experienced minimal losses as a result of its settlement risk guarantee. Howev er, the Company's future obligations, which could be material under its guarantees, are not determinable as they are dependent upon future ev ents.\n\nThe Company's settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time, which v ary significantly day to day. For fiscal 2024, the Company's maximum daily settlement exposure was $137.4 billion and the av erage daily settlement exposure was $84.3  billion.

      "question": "How does the fixed-rate dividend structure of Series L preferred stock, as issued by COF, compare with MS's classification of Series L in terms of redemption flexibility and dividend rate type, and what does this reveal about their respective capital structure strategies?",
      "answer": "COF's Series L preferred stock, issued on May 4, 2021, has a fixed dividend rate of 4.375% and a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, with redemption beginning September 1, 2026. In contrast, MS also references Series L preferred stock and explicitly categorizes it as having a fixed-rate dividend, aligning with COF's structure. However, MS provides broader context on redemption flexibility, noting that Series L can be redeemed in whole or in part on any dividend payment date on or after the redemption date. This comparison reveals that both firms use fixed-rate preferred stock like Series L to maintain predictable capital costs, but MS emphasizes strategic redemption flexibility, suggesting a more dynamic capital management approach.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - COF's Series L has a fixed dividend rate of 4.375%, liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, and is redeemable starting September 1, 2026.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - MS identifies Series L as a fixed-rate preferred stock and explains its redemption flexibility, which includes being redeemed in whole or in part on or after the redemption date.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies issue Series L preferred stock with the same fixed dividend structure, but MS provides more detailed redemption flexibility, indicating differing capital structure strategies: COF focuses on stability, while MS emphasizes optionality."

      "question": "How does the application of the Basel III 'well-capitalized' standards differ between COF and MS, based on the specific regulatory frameworks and capital buffer mechanisms each firm discloses?",
      "answer": "COF reports its capital ratios under the Basel III standardized approach and compares them to both regulatory minimums and well-capitalized standards as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, indicating a direct linkage to how it measures compliance. In contrast, MS describes a broader regulatory capital framework influenced by both the Federal Reserve and the OCC, with capital requirements based on Basel III standards but also incorporating Dodd-Frank Act provisions and CECL deferral impacts. MS also explains a phased-in capital buffer mechanism tied to CECL adoption, which affects its capital amounts and ratios over time, unlike COF's more static reporting of ratios at year-end.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - COF provides a comparison of its regulatory capital ratios under the Basel III standardized approach against regulatory minimums and well-capitalized standards as of specific dates (December 31, 2023 and 2022).",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - MS describes its regulatory capital requirements under Basel III, including phased-in CECL deferral impacts affecting capital and ratios, and notes oversight by both the Federal Reserve and OCC, with additional Dodd-Frank-related requirements.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While both firms are subject to Basel III and the 'well-capitalized' standards, COF focuses on static year-end comparisons, whereas MS details a more dynamic regulatory framework involving phased buffers, deferrals, and multi-agency oversight."

This aligns with COF's stated concern that a prolonged period of economic weakness could materially affect their financial results by reducing consumer and business activity, increasing delinquencies, and weakening borrower ability to service debt.

      "question": "How do the tax restrictions described in Morgan Stanley's 2023 10-K influence the structure of Bank of America's Global Liquidity Sources (GLS) strategy across its subsidiaries?",
      "answer": "Morgan Stanley's 2023 10-K explicitly states that regulatory and tax restrictions may limit the free transfer of funds between the parent company and its subsidiaries. These restrictions directly impact how financial institutions manage liquidity across their legal entities. In response, Bank of America's GLS strategy specifically accounts for these types of regulatory, tax, and legal restrictions by holding liquidity in legal entities that allow the Corporation to meet the liquidity requirements of its global businesses. This is evidenced by BAC\u2019s detailed discussion of how it maintains a liquidity buffer composed of cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities across its Parent and subsidiaries, while considering the impact of potential restrictions on the transferability of funds. Thus, the presence of tax restrictions like those described by Morgan Stanley necessitates a more strategic allocation of liquidity resources by Bank of America, as reflected in its GLS framework.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source B (MS_10k_2023.pdf) - Morgan Stanley explicitly states that 'regulatory restrictions, tax restrictions or elections and other legal restrictions may limit our ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from our subsidiaries.'",
        "Step 2: Extract from source A (BAC_10k_2023.pdf) - Bank of America maintains liquidity across its Parent and subsidiaries and 'considers the impact of potential regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions that could limit the transferability of funds among entities.'",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Given that Morgan Stanley is subject to tax restrictions on fund transfers between entities, and Bank of America explicitly accounts for such restrictions in its liquidity planning, it follows that these restrictions influence the structure of BAC\u2019s GLS strategy to ensure liquidity remains accessible within constrained regulatory and tax frameworks."

      "question": "How does the application of Delaware Law specifically constrain the capital return strategies of both Bank of America Corporation and BNY Mellon, based on their respective 2023 10-K filings?",
      "answer": "Bank of America Corporation is incorporated under Delaware Law, which directly governs its corporate structure and regulatory compliance, including capital planning and shareholder returns. BNY Mellon explicitly states in its 2023 10-K that its ability to return capital to shareholders is subject to applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Both companies must therefore consider Delaware's legal framework when determining dividend policies and share buybacks, creating a shared regulatory constraint on capital return strategies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Bank of America Corporation is incorporated under Delaware Law, as stated in its charter information in the 10-K filing.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - BNY Mellon notes that its capital return strategy is subject to Delaware Law provisions, indicating a direct regulatory impact on shareholder returns.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are subject to Delaware Law, which constrains their capital return mechanisms such as dividends and buybacks, creating a shared regulatory boundary that affects their financial strategies."

Fair Value Measurements\n\nWe value our super senior credit default swap portfolio using prices obtained from vendors and/or counterparties. The valuation of the super senior credit derivatives is complex because of the limited availability of market observable information due to the lack of trading and price transparency in certain structured finance markets. Our valuation methodologies for the super senior CDS portfolio have evolved over time in response to market conditions and the availability of market observable information. We have sought to calibrate the methodologies to available market information and to review the assumptions of the methodologies on a regular basis.\n\n## Fortitude Re funds withheld payable\n\nThe reinsurance transactions between AIG and Fortitude Re were structured as modco and loss portfolio transfer arrangements with funds withheld (funds withheld). AIG has established a funds withheld payable to Fortitude Re while simultaneously establishing a reinsurance asset representing reserves for the insurance coverage that Fortitude Re has assumed. The funds withheld payable contains an embedded derivative and changes in fair value of the embedded derivative related to the funds withheld payable are recognized in earnings through realized gains (losses). This embedded derivative is considered a total return swap with contractual returns that are attributable to v arious assets and liabilities associated with these reinsurance agreements.\n\n## Other Liabilities\n\nOther liabilities measured at fair value include certain securities sold under agreements to repurchase and certain securities sold but not yet purchased. Liabilities arising from securities sold under agreements to repurchase are generally treated as collateralized borrowings. We estimate the fair value of liabilities arising under these agreements by using market-observable interest rates. This methodology considers such factors as the coupon rate, yield curves and other relevant factors. Fair values for securities sold but not yet purchased are based on current market prices.\n\n## ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS\n\nThe following table presents information about assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and indicates the level of the fair value measurement based on the observability of the inputs used:\n\n",

In contrast, AXP maintains a continuous funding policy aimed at achieving diversity and cost efficiency in funding sources, which is not tied to periodic revisions but rather to ongoing asset-liability management and liquidity needs.

Our funding strategy and activities are integrated into our asset-liability management activities. We have in place a funding policy covering American Express Company and all of our subsidiaries.\n\nOur financing needs are in large part a consequence of our proprietary card-issuing businesses, where we generally pay merchants for card transactions prior to reimbursement by Card Members and therefore fund the merchant payments during the period Card Member loans and receivables are outstanding. In addition, we maintain a liquidity position to meet regulatory requirements and support our business activities.\n\nWe aim to satisfy these financing needs with a diverse set of funding sources. The diversity of funding sources by type of instrument, by tenor and by investor base, among other factors, mitigates the impact of disruptions in any one type of instrument, tenor or investor. We seek to achieve diversity and cost efficiency in our funding sources by maintaining scale and market relevance in deposits, unsecured debt and asset securitizations and access to secured borrowing facilities and a committed bank credit facility. In particular, we are focused on continuing to grow our direct deposit program as a funding source.\n\nOur funding plan is primarily driven by the size and mix of business asset growth, our liquidity position and choice of funding sources, as well as cash requirements generated by withdrawals of deposits by our customers, the maturities of debt outstanding and related interest payments. In executing our funding plan, we aim to maintain a balanced debt maturity profile with an appropriate mix of short-term and long-term refinancing requirements.\n\n## FUNDING PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES\n\nWe had the following customer deposits and consolidated debt outstanding as of December 31:\n\n## TABLE 18: SUMMARY OF CUSTOMER DEPOSITS AND CONSOLIDATED DEBT\n\n",

However, changes in the fair value of these assets are included in the embedded derivative in the Fortitude Re funds withheld arrangement and the appreciation (depreciation) of the asset is the primary driver of the comprehensive income (loss) reflected above.\n\n## Reinsurance Security\n\nOur third-party reinsurance arrangements do not relieve us from our direct obligations to our beneficiaries. Thus, a credit exposure exists with respect to both shortduration and long-duration reinsurance ceded to the extent that any reinsurer fails to meet the obligations assumed under any reinsurance agreement. We hold substantial collateral as security under related reinsurance agreements in the form of funds, securities, and/or letters of credit. A  provision has been recorded for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance. In light of collateral held, we believe that no exposure to a single reinsurer represents an inappropriate concentration of credit risk to A IG. Gross reinsurance assets due from reinsurers exceeding 5 percent of our total reinsurance assets were approximately $15.2 billion and $16.5 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of which approximately $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was not secured by collateral.\n\n## REINSURANCE - CREDIT LOSSES\n\nThe estimation of reinsurance recoverables involves a significant amount of judgment, particularly for latent exposures, such as asbestos, due to their long-tail nature. We assess the collectability of reinsurance recoverable balances in each reporting period, through either historical trends of disputes and credit events or financial analysis of the credit quality of the reinsurer. We record adjustments to reflect the results of these assessments through an allowance for credit losses and disputes on uncollectible reinsurance that reduces the carrying amount of reinsurance and deposit accounting assets on the consolidated balance sheets (collectively, reinsurance recoverables). This estimate requires significant judgment for which key considerations include:\n\n- paid and unpaid amounts recoverable;\n- whether the balance is in dispute or subject to legal collection;\n- the relativ e financial health of the reinsurer as classified by  the Obligor Risk Ratings (ORRs) we assign to each reinsurer based upon our financial reviews; reinsurers that are financially troubled (i.e., in run-off, hav e v oluntarily  or inv oluntarily  been placed in receiv ership, are insolv ent, are in the process of liquidation or otherwise subject to formal or informal regulatory restriction) are assigned ORRs that will generate a significant allowance; and\n- whether collateral and collateral arrangements exist.\n\nAn estimate of the reinsurance recoverable's lifetime expected credit losses is established utilizing a probability of default and loss given default method, which reflects the reinsurer's ORR. The allowance for credit losses excludes disputed amounts. A n allowance for disputes is established for a reinsurance recoverable using the losses incurred model for contingencies.\n\nThe total reinsurance recoverables as of December 31, 2024 were $40.5 billion. A s of that date, utilizing A IG's ORRs, (i) approximately 83 percent of the reinsurance recoverables were investment grade; (ii) approximately 15 percent of the reinsurance recoverables were non-investment grade and (iii) approximately 2 percent of the reinsurance recoverables related to entities that were not rated by A IG.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n\n137",

      "answer": "AIG applies internal valuation models or third-party asset managers to determine fair values for illiquid fixed maturity securities, subject to management review, especially for complex instruments like RMBS, CMBS, and CLOs. This approach introduces a level of subjectivity and potential variability in valuation due to reliance on unobservable inputs. In contrast, AXP manages credit risk in its derivative portfolio by requiring counterparties to post collateral if the fair value change in the net derivatives position exceeds certain thresholds, and it centrally monitors counterparty credit risk. These differences indicate that AIG has higher exposure to market risk through its investment portfolio's illiquidity and model dependency, while AXP faces more structured credit and counterparty risk exposure due to its use of derivatives for hedging and risk management purposes.",

Fair v alues determined internally  or v ia our third party  asset managers are also subject to management review to ensure that valuation models and related inputs are reasonable.\n\nThe methodology above is relevant for all fixed maturity securities including residential mortgage backed securities (RM BS), commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS), collateralized loan obligations (CLO), other asset -backed securities (A BS) and fixed maturity securities issued by government sponsored entities and corporate entities.\n\n## Equity Securities Traded in Active Markets\n\nWhenever available, we obtain quoted prices in active markets for identical assets at the balance sheet date to measure equity securities at fair value. M arket price data is generally obtained from exchange or dealer markets.\n\n## Mortgage and Other Loans Receivable\n\nWe estimate the fair value of mortgage and other loans receivable that are measured at fair value by using dealer quotations, discounted cash flow analyses and/or internal valuation models. The determination of fair value considers inputs such as interest rate, maturity, the borrower's creditworthiness, collateral, subordination, guarantees, past-due status, yield curves, credit curves, prepayment rates, market pricing for comparable loans and other relevant factors.\n\n## Other Invested Assets\n\nWe initially  estimate the fair v alue of inv estments in certain hedge funds, priv ate equity  funds and other inv estment partnerships by reference to the transaction price. Subsequently, we generally obtain the fair value of these investments from net asset value information provided by the general partner or manager of the investments, the financial statements of which are generally audited annually. We consider observable market data and perform certain control procedures to validate the appropriateness of using the net asset value as a fair value measurement. The fair values of other investments carried at fair value, such as direct private equity holdings, are initially  determined based on transaction price and are subsequently estimated based on available evidence such as market transactions in similar instruments, other financing transactions of the issuer and other available financial information for the issuer, with adjustments made to reflect illiquidity as appropriate. AIG's retained investments in Corebridge, for which we have elected the fair value option, is determined using Corebridge's stock price as its fair value.\n\n## Short-term Investments\n\nFor short-term investments that are measured at amortized cost, the carrying amounts of these assets approximate fair values because of the relatively short period of time between origination and expected realization, and their limited exposure to credit risk. Securities purchased under agreements to resell (reverse repurchase agreements) are generally treated as collateralized receivables. We report certain receivables arising from securities purchased under agreements to resell as Shortterm investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. When these receivables are measured at fair value, we use market-observable interest rates to determine fair value.\n\n## Freestanding Derivatives\n\nDerivative assets and liabilities can be exchange-traded or traded over-the-counter (OTC). We generally value exchange-traded derivatives such as futures and options using quoted prices in active markets for identical derivatives at the balance sheet date.\n\nOTC derivatives are valued using market transactions and other market evidence whenever possible, including market-based inputs to models, model calibration to market clearing transactions, broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. When models are used, the selection of a particular model to value an OTC derivative depends on the contractual terms of, and specific risks inherent in the instrument, as well as the availability of pricing information in the market. We generally use similar models to value similar instruments. V aluation models require a variety of inputs, including contractual terms, market prices and rates, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates and correlations of such inputs. For OTC derivatives that trade in liquid markets, such as generic forwards, swaps and options, model inputs can generally be corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means, and model selection does not involve significant management judgment.\n\nFor certain OTC derivatives that trade in less liquid markets, where we generally do not have corroborating market evidence to support significant model inputs and cannot verify the model to market transactions, the transaction price may provide the best estimate of fair value. A ccordingly, when a pricing model is used to value such an instrument, the model is adjusted so the model value at inception equals the transaction price. We will update valuation inputs in these models only when corroborated by evidence such as similar market transactions, independent third-party valuation service providers and/or broker or dealer quotations, or other empirical market data. When appropriate, valuations are adjusted for various factors such as liquidity, bid/offer spreads and credit considerations. Such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence. In the absence of such evidence, management's best estimate is used.\n\n112\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## NOTE 13\n\n## DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\n\nWe use derivative financial instruments to manage exposures to various market risks. These instruments derive their value from an underlying variable or multiple variables, including interest rates and foreign ex change rates, and are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These instruments enable end users to increase, reduce or alter ex posure to various market risks and, for that reason, are an integral component of our market risk management. We do not transact in derivatives for trading purposes.\n\nMarket risk is the risk to earnings or asset and liability values resulting from movements in market prices. Our market risk ex posures include:\n\n- Interest rate risk due to changes in the relationship between the interest rates on our assets (such as loans, receivables and investment securities) and the interest rates on our liabilities (such as debt and deposits); and\n- Foreign exchange risk related to transactions, funding, investments and earnings in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.\n\nWe centrally monitor market risks using market risk limits and escalation triggers as defined in our Asset/Liability Management Policy. Our market exposures are in large part by-products of the delivery of our products and services.\n\nInterest rate risk primarily arises through the funding of Card Member receivables and fixed-rate loans with variable-rate borrowings, as well as through the risk to net interest margin from changes in the relationship between benchmark rates such as Prime, the secured overnight financing rate and the overnight indexed swap rate. Interest rate ex posure within our charge card and fix ed-rate lending products is managed by varying the proportion of total funding provided by short-term and variable-rate debt and deposits compared to fixed-rate debt and deposits. In addition, interest rate swaps are used from time to time to economically convert fixed-rate debt obligations to variable-rate obligations, or to convert variable-rate debt obligations to fix ed-rate obligations. We may change the mix  between variable-rate and fix ed-rate funding based on changes in business volumes and mix, among other factors.\n\nForeign exchange exposures arise in four principal ways: (1) Card Member spending in currencies that are not the billing currency, (2) cross-currency transactions and balances from our funding activities, (3) cross-currency investing activities, such as in the equity of foreign subsidiaries and (4) revenues generated and expenses incurred in foreign currencies, which impact earnings. Our foreign exchange risk is managed primarily by entering into agreements to buy and sell currencies on a spot basis or by hedging this market exposure, to the extent it is economical, through various means, including the use of derivatives such as foreign exchange forwards.\n\nDerivatives may give rise to counterparty credit risk, which is the risk that a derivative counterparty will default on, or otherwise be unable to perform pursuant to, an uncollateralized derivative ex posure. We manage this risk by considering the current exposure, which is the replacement cost of contracts on the measurement date, as well as estimating the maximum potential future exposure of the contracts over the next 12 months, considering such factors as the volatility of the underlying or reference index. To mitigate derivative credit risk, counterparties are required to be pre-approved by us and rated as investment grade, and counterparty risk exposures are centrally monitored.\n\nA majority of our derivative assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 are subject to master netting agreements with our derivative counterparties. Accordingly, where appropriate, we have elected to present derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty on a net basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. To further mitigate counterparty credit risk, we ex ercise our rights under ex ecuted credit support agreements with the respective derivative counterparties for our bilateral interest rate swaps and select foreign ex change contracts. These agreements require that, in the event the fair value change in the net derivatives position between the two parties exceeds certain dollar thresholds, the party in the net liability position posts collateral to its counterparty. All derivative contracts cleared through a central clearinghouse are collateralized to the full amount of the fair value of the contracts.\n\nIn relation to our credit risk, certain of our bilateral derivative agreements include provisions that allow our counterparties to terminate the relevant agreement in the event of a downgrade of our debt credit rating below investment grade and settle the outstanding net liability position. As of December 31, 2024, these derivatives were not in a material net liability position and we had no material risk ex posure to any individual derivative counterparty. Based on our assessment of the credit risk of our derivative counterparties and our own credit risk as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, no credit risk adjustment to the derivative portfolio was required.\n\nOur derivatives are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The accounting for changes in fair value depends on the instruments' intended use and the resulting hedge designation, if any, as discussed below.

      "answer": "Bank of America incorporates prepayment risk into the valuation of its Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs) using an option-adjusted spread valuation approach, which projects servicing cash flows under multiple interest rate scenarios and discounts them using risk-adjusted rates to account for prepayment risk.

In contrast, PayPal shares prepayment risk with its U.S. partner institution through a pro rata participation interest in the receivables pool for consumer interest-bearing installment products and merchant finance offerings. PayPal derecognizes the sold participation interest and shares both credit and prepayment risk equally with the partner institution, thereby distributing the financial impact of prepayment rather than absorbing it directly as BAC does with its MSRs.",

      "answer": "The total amortized cost of permanent loan modifications for residential mortgage and home equity loans at BAC in 2023 was $185 million ($154 million for residential mortgage loans and $31 million for home equity loans). Meanwhile, PYPL also implemented loan modification programs for merchants experiencing financial difficulty, primarily through term extensions that increased the loan term and moved the delinquency status to current. These modifications were intended to provide financial relief and potentially mitigate losses, similar to BAC\u2019s approach, but specifically tailored to merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, extract the amortized cost of permanent modifications for residential mortgage loans ($154 million) and home equity loans ($31 million) at BAC in 2023.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, identify that PYPL modified merchant loans through term extensions to provide financial relief to merchants, moving delinquency status to current.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the two approaches: BAC focused on consumer real estate loans with permanent modifications involving term extensions and interest rate reductions, while PYPL targeted merchant loans with term extensions to mitigate losses, showing similar strategies applied to different loan categories."

      "question": "How does acting as an agent affect revenue recognition practices for Bank of America's derivatives and PayPal's cryptocurrency transactions, and what impact does this have on financial statement comparability between traditional banks and fintech companies?",
      "answer": "Acting as an agent affects revenue recognition by determining which income statement line items report the associated fees or gains. At Bank of America, when the corporation acts as an agent in derivative transactions\u2014such as with exchange-traded futures and options\u2014fees are recorded in 'other income' rather than being included in trading revenue. This contrasts with PayPal's treatment of cryptocurrency transactions, where the company acts as an agent and recognizes a crypto asset safeguarding liability (with a corresponding safeguarding asset) to reflect its obligation to safeguard cryptocurrencies held on behalf of customers, without recognizing cryptocurrency assets on its balance sheet. These differing treatments impact financial statement comparability: BAC integrates agent-based derivative fees into non-trading income, while PYPL separates crypto-related obligations entirely from assets, affecting how revenue and liabilities are presented across traditional banks and fintech firms.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from BAC evidence - When Bank of America acts as an agent in derivative transactions (e.g., exchange-traded futures and options), fees are recorded in 'other income' rather than being included in trading revenue.",
        "Step 2: Extract from PYPL evidence - PayPal acts as an agent in cryptocurrency transactions, recognizing a crypto asset safeguarding liability (with a corresponding safeguarding asset) without recognizing cryptocurrency assets on its balance sheet.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The agent designation leads to different revenue and asset recognition practices: BAC reports agent-based derivative fees in 'other income,' whereas PYPL excludes crypto assets entirely from its balance sheet while recognizing a liability. This divergence impacts how financial statements are structured and interpreted between traditional banking and fintech models."

This contributes to its Business Lending revenue growth of $1.3 billion in 2023.

      "answer": "Morgan Stanley's U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are required by the OCC to develop a recovery plan by January 2026, which outlines actions to remain a going concern under financial stress, as part of their regulatory obligations under heightened risk governance standards. This requirement is tied to their status as large insured depository institutions (IDIs) with over $100 billion in assets. In contrast, Charles Schwab, as a Financial Holding Company (FHC), is subject to Federal Reserve oversight that ties its ability to conduct broader financial activities to maintaining 'well-capitalized' and 'well-managed' status, and a 'Satisfactory' Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) rating. If Schwab fails to meet these capital adequacy or CRA standards, it may face restrictions on new activities or even forced divestiture of its depository institutions. Thus, while both firms face regulatory requirements tied to capital and risk management, Morgan Stanley's obligations are recovery planning focused, whereas Schwab's are conditional on ongoing capital adequacy and CRA compliance.",

Submission of interim targeted information by our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries  generally  will  not  be  required  during  a  year  which  the  Parent Company is required to submit a resolution plan to the Federal Reserve and FDIC. The first submission for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries under this rule will be in 2026. In addition, the OCC requires IDIs with assets of $100 billion or more,  including  our  U.S.  Bank  Subsidiaries,  to  develop  recovery  plans detailing the actions they would take to remain a going concern when they experience considerable financial or non-financial stress,  but  have  not deteriorated to the point that resolution is imminent. Our U.S.  Bank Subsidiaries are required to develop a recovery plan by January 2026.\n\nIn addition, certain financial companies, including BHCs such as the Firm and certain of its subsidiaries, can be subject to a resolution proceeding under the orderly  liquidation  authority,  with  the  FDIC  being  appointed  as  receiver, provided that determination of extraordinary financial distress and systemic risk  is  made  by  the  U.S.  Treasury  Secretary  in  consultation  with  the  U.S. president.  Regulators  have  adopted  certain  orderly  liquidation  authority implementing regulations and may expand or clarify these regulations in the future. If we were subject to the orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC would have  considerable  powers,  including:  the  power  to  remove  directors  and officers responsible for our failure and to appoint new directors and officers; the power to assign our assets and liabilities to a third party or bridge financial company  without  the  need  for  creditor  consent  or  prior  court  review;  the ability to differentiate among our creditors, including treating certain creditors within the same class better than others, subject to a minimum recovery right on the part of disfavored creditors to receive at least what they would have received in bankruptcy liquidation; and broad powers to administer the claims process  to  determine  distributions  from  the  assets  of  the  receivership.  The FDIC has indicated that it expects to use an SPOE strategy if the FDIC were to implement the orderly liquidation authority for a U.S. G-SIB.\n\nRegulators have also taken and proposed various actions to facilitate an SPOE strategy under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the orderly liquidation authority or other resolution regimes.\n\nFor  more  information  about  our  resolution  plan-related  submissions  and associated  regulatory  actions,  see  'Risk  Factors-Legal,  Regulatory  and Compliance  Risk,'  'Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial Condition  and  Results  of  Operations-Liquidity  and  Capital  ResourcesRegulatory Requirements-Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements' and 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Regulatory Requirements-Resolution and Recovery Planning.'\n\n## Institutional Securities and Wealth Management\n\nU.S. Bank  Subsidiaries. Our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are FDIC-insured depository institutions subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the  OCC  and  are  subject  to  the  OCC's  risk  governance  guidelines,  which establish  heightened  standards  for  a  large  IDI's  risk  governance  framework and the oversight of that framework by the IDI's board of directors. Our U.S. Bank  Subsidiaries  are  also  subject  to  prompt  corrective  action  standards, which require the relevant federal banking regulator to take prompt corrective action with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain  capital  adequacy  standards.  In  addition,  BHCs,  such  as  Morgan Stanley,  are  required  to  serve  as  a  source  of  strength  to  their  U.S.  bank subsidiaries and commit resources to support these subsidiaries in the event such  subsidiaries  are  in  financial  distress.  Our  U.S.  Bank  Subsidiaries' business  activities are generally limited  to  supporting  our  Institutional Securities and Wealth Management business segments.\n\nOur U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are subject to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which impose restrictions on certain transactions with affiliates, including any extension of credit to, or purchase of assets from, an affiliate. These restrictions limit the total amount of credit ex posure that our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries  may  have  to  any  one  affiliate  and  to  all  affiliates  and  require collateral for those ex posures. Section 23B requires affiliate transactions to be on market terms.\n\nAs  commonly  controlled  FDIC-insured  depository  institutions,  each  of  our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries could be responsible for any loss to the FDIC from the failure of the other U.S. Bank Subsidiary.\n\nBroker-Dealer and Investment Adviser Regulation. Our primary U.S. brokerdealer  subsidiaries,  Morgan  Stanley  &amp;  Co.  LLC  ('MS&amp;Co.')  and  Morgan Stanley  Smith  Barney  LLC  ('MSSB')  are  registered  broker-dealers  with  the SEC and in all 50 states, the  District of  Columbia,  Puerto  Rico and the  U.S. Virgin  Islands  and  are  members  of  various  self-regulatory  organizations, including the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ('FINRA'), and various securities ex changes and clearing organizations. Broker-dealers are subject to laws and regulations covering all aspects of the securities business, including sales  and  trading  practices,  securities  offerings,  publication  of  research reports, use  of customers'  funds  and  securities,  capital structure, risk management  controls  in  connection  with  market  access,  recordkeeping  and retention,  and  the  conduct  of  their  directors,  officers,  representatives  and other  associated  persons.  Broker-dealers  are  also  regulated  by  securities administrators in those states where they do business. Our significant brokerdealer subsidiaries are members of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation.\n\nMSSB  is  also  a  registered  investment  adviser  with  the  SEC.

By functioning as the custodian, Schwab earns revenue associated with the underlying client assets, predominantly through net interest revenue and asset management and administration fees. In this capacity, we do not charge the RIA or end client a custody fee.\n\nAs part of our integration of Ameritrade, we have added some of the best features from Ameritrade into our ongoing offerings. The Company's thinkpipes trading platform offers real-time charting and efficient trading and allocation, and iRebal provides customizable portfolio rebalancing - both now part of our ongoing offering for RIA clients. \u00ae \u00ae\n\n## Sources of Net Revenues\n\nSchwab's largest sources of net revenues are net interest revenue, asset management and administration fees, trading revenue, and bank deposit account fees. These revenue streams are supported by the combination of our bank, broker-dealer, and asset management operating subsidiaries, each of which brings specific capabilities that enable us to provide clients with the products and services they are seeking.\n\nNet interest revenue is the difference between interest generated on interest-earning assets and interest paid on funding sources. Schwab's primary funding source for interest-earning assets is uninvested client cash balances held on our balance sheet as part of clients' overall relationship with the Company. Schwab's interestearning assets are primarily comprised of high-quality fix ed income securities, margin loans, and bank loans.\n\nAsset management and administration fees are primarily earned from proprietary money market mutual funds, proprietary and third-party mutual funds and ETFs, and fee-based advisory solutions.\n\nTrading revenue includes commissions earned for executing trades for clients in certain individual equities, options, futures, fix ed income securities, and certain thirdparty mutual funds and ETFs; order flow revenue; and principal transactions revenue earned primarily from actions to support client trading in fixed income securities.\n\nBank deposit account fees are primarily recognized pursuant to the Company's IDA agreement with the TD Depository Institutions. Under the IDA agreement, uninvested cash within eligible brokerage client accounts is swept off-balance sheet to deposit accounts at the TD Depository Institutions. Schwab provides recordkeeping and support services to the TD Depository Institutions for bank deposit account fees.\n\n## Regulation\n\nAs a participant in the securities, banking and financial services industries, Schwab is subject to ex tensive regulation under both federal and state laws by governmental agencies, supervisory authorities, and self-regulatory organizations (SROs). We are also subject to oversight by regulatory bodies in other countries in which we operate. These regulations affect our business operations and impose capital, client protection, and market conduct requirements.\n\n## Holding Company and Bank Regulation\n\nCSC is a savings and loan holding company and is regulated, supervised, and examined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve). CSC has elected to be treated as a Financial Holding Company (FHC) by the Federal Reserve. In addition to the activities that a savings and loan holding company that has not elected to be treated as an FHC is permitted to conduct, an FHC may also engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity (FHC Activities), including underwriting, dealing and making markets in securities, various insurance underwriting activities, and making merchant banking investments in non-financial companies.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has the authority to limit an FHC's ability to conduct otherwise permissible FHC Activities if the FHC or any of its depository institution subsidiaries ceases to meet the applicable eligibility requirements, including requirements that the FHC and each of its depository institution subsidiaries maintain their status as 'well-capitalized' and 'well-managed.' If the Federal Reserve finds that an FHC fails to meet these requirements, the FHC and its subsidiaries may not commence any new FHC Activity, either de novo or through an acquisition, without prior Federal Reserve approval. The Federal Reserve may also impose any additional limitations or conditions on the conduct or activities of the FHC or any of its subsidiaries as it deems appropriate. If the FHC still fails to satisfy the applicable eligibility requirements 180 days after the Federal Reserve's finding, the agency may require divestiture of all of the FHC's depository institution subsidiaries or, alternatively, the FHC may elect to cease all of its FHC Activities. In addition, if any depository institution controlled by an FHC fails to maintain at least a 'Satisfactory' rating under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA), the FHC and its subsidiaries are prohibited from",

Although  we  regularly review our credit exposures, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee.\n\n## A default by a large financial institution could adversely affect financial markets.\n\nThe  commercial  soundness  of  many  financial  institutions  and  certain  other large financial services firms may be closely interrelated as a result of credit, trading, clearing or other relationships among  such  entities. Increased centralization  of  trading  activities  through  particular  clearinghouses,  central agents or exchanges may increase our concentration of risk with respect to these entities. As a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by, one or more such entities could lead to significant market-wide liquidity and  credit  problems,  losses  or  defaults  by  other  institutions,  or  require financial  commitments  to  multilateral  actions  intended  to  support  market stability.  This  is  sometimes  referred  to  as  systemic  risk  and  may  adversely affect  financial  intermediaries,  such  as  clearinghouses,  clearing  agencies, exchanges, banks and securities firms, with which we interact on a daily basis and,  therefore,  could  adversely  affect  us.  See  also  'Systemic  Risk  Regime' under 'Business-Supervision and Regulation-Financial Holding Company.'\n\n## Operational Risk\n\nOperational  risk  refers  to  the  risk  of  loss,  or  of  damage  to  our  reputation, resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems, human factors (e.g., inappropriate  or  unlawful  conduct)  or  ex ternal  events  (e.g . ,  cyberattacks  or third-party vulnerabilities) that may  manifest as, for example, loss of information, business  disruption,  theft and  fraud, legal,  regulatory  and compliance risks, or damage to physical assets. We  may  experience operational  risk  across  the  full  scope  of  our  business  activities,  including revenue-generating activities and support and control groups (e.g . , information  technology  ('IT')  and  trade  processing).  Legal,  regulatory  and compliance risk is included in the scope of operational risk and is discussed below under 'Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk.' For more information on  how  we  monitor  and  manage  operational  risk,  see  'Quantitative  and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk-Operational Risk.'\n\nWe are subject to operational risks, including a failure, breach or other disruption of our operations or security systems or those of our third parties (or  third  parties  thereof),  as  well  as  human  error  or  malfeasance,  which could adversely affect our businesses or reputation.\n\nOur businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process and report, on a  daily  basis,  a  large  number  of  transactions  across  numerous  and  diverse markets in many currencies. We may introduce new products or services or change processes or reporting, including in connection with new regulatory requirements, or integration of processes or systems of acquired companies, resulting in new operational risk that we may not fully appreciate or identify.\n\nThe trend toward direct access to automated, electronic markets, and the move to more automated trading platforms has resulted in the use of increasingly complex  technology  that relies on  the continued  effectiveness of  the programming code and integrity of the data to process the trades. We rely on the  ability  of  our  employees,  our  consultants,  our  internal  systems  and systems  at  technology  centers  maintained  by  unaffiliated  third  parties  to operate our different businesses and process a high volume of transactions. Unusually  high  trading  volumes  or  site  usage  could  cause  our  systems  to operate at an unacceptably slow speed or even fail. Disruptions to, destruction  of,  instability  of  or  other  failure  to  effectively  maintain  our  IT systems or external technology that allows our clients and customers to use our products and services (including our self-directed brokerage platform and mobile services) could harm our business and our reputation.\n\nAs  a  major  participant  in  the  global  capital  markets,  we  face  the  risk  of incorrect valuation or risk management of our trading positions due to flaws in data,  models,  electronic  trading  systems  or  processes,  or  due  to  fraud  or cyberattacks. We also face the risk of operational failure or disruption of any of the clearing agents, exchanges, clearinghouses or other financial intermediaries  we  use  to  facilitate  our  lending,  securities  and  derivatives transactions. In addition, in the event of a breakdown or improper operation or disposal of our, or a direct or indirect third party's (or third parties thereof) systems, processes or information assets, or improper or unauthorized action by third parties, including consultants and subcontractors or our employees, we  have  received  in  the  past  and  may  receive  in  the  future  regulatory sanctions,  and  could  suffer  financial  loss,  an  impairment  to  our  liquidity position, a disruption of our businesses or damage to our reputation.\n\nIn addition, the interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with central agents, exchanges and clearinghouses, and the increased importance of these entities, increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industrywide operational failure that could materially impact our ability  to  conduct  business.  Furthermore,  the  concentration  of  Firm  and personal information held by a small number of third parties increases the risk that  a  breach  or  disruption  at  a  key  third  party  may  cause  an  industrywide event  that  could  significantly  increase  the  cost  and  risk  of  conducting business. These risks may be heightened to the extent that we rely on third parties that are concentrated in a geographic area.\n\nThere can be no assurance that our or our third parties' business contingency and security response plans fully mitigate all potential risks to us. Our ability to  conduct  business  may  be  adversely  affected  by  a  disruption  in  the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities where we are located.  This  may  include  a  disruption  involving  physical  site  access; software flaws and",

We may also be required to pay ransom to threat actors to restore or prevent dissemination of data.\n\nWe also face risk related to ex ternal fraud involving the misappropriation and use of clients' user names, passwords or other personal information to gain access to our clients' financial accounts. This could occur from the compromise of clients' personal electronic devices or as a result of a data security breach at an unrelated company where clients' personal information is taken and then made available to fraudsters. Additionally, data exposure can result from a failure to adequately destroy data during system or asset decommissioning, which might result in client or Company information being made available to external parties in error. Such risks have grown in recent years due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime and other external parties, including foreign state-sponsored parties. Losses reimbursed to clients under our guarantee against unauthorized account activity could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n## Technology and operational failures or errors and other operational risks could subject us to losses, litigation, regulatory actions, and reputational damage.\n\nWe must process, record and monitor a large number of transactions and our operations are highly dependent on the integrity of our technology systems and our ability to make timely enhancements and additions to our systems. System interruptions, errors or downtime can result from a variety of causes, including changes in client use patterns, technological failure, changes to our systems, linkages with third-party systems and power failures and can have a significant impact on our business and operations. Our systems are vulnerable to disruptions from human error, execution errors, errors in models such as those used for asset management, capital planning and management, risk management, stress testing and compliance, employee misconduct, unauthorized trading, external fraud, computer viruses, distributed denial of service attacks, cyber attacks, terrorist attacks, natural disaster, ex treme weather, power outage, capacity constraints, software flaws, events impacting key business partners and vendors, and similar events. For example, we and other financial institutions have been the target of various denial of service attacks that have, in certain circumstances, made websites, mobile applications and email unavailable for periods of time. Cloud technologies are critical to the operation of our systems and platforms and our reliance on cloud technologies is growing. We have experienced, and could, in the future, experience cloud service disruptions that lead to delays in accessing data that is important to our businesses. Such disruptions, such as the broad-reaching cloud platform outages that impacted multiple industries in 2024, can and have hindered our clients' access to our platforms. It could take an extended period of time to restore full functionality to our technology or other operating systems in the event of an unforeseen occurrence, which could affect our ability to process and settle client transactions. Despite our efforts to identify areas of risk, oversee operational areas involving risk, and implement policies and procedures designed to manage these risks, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer unexpected losses, reputational damage or regulatory action due to technology or other operational failures or errors, including those of our vendors or other third parties.\n\nWhile we devote substantial attention and resources to the reliability, capacity and scalability of our systems, we occasionally experience extraordinary trading volumes, which have caused and could cause our computer systems to operate at unacceptably slow speeds or even fail, affecting our ability to process client transactions and potentially resulting in some clients' orders being executed at prices they did not anticipate. Disruptions in service and slower system response times could result in substantial losses, decreased client satisfaction, reputational damage, and regulatory inquiries. We are also dependent on the integrity and performance of securities exchanges, clearing houses, market makers, dealers, and other intermediaries to which client orders are routed for execution and settlement. System failures and constraints and transaction errors at such intermediaries could result in delays and erroneous or unanticipated execution prices and cancelled orders, cause substantial losses for us and for our clients, and subject us to claims from our clients for damages, and cause reputational harm. We experienced in 2024 technology outages of client websites, mobile applications, and certain corporate technology as a result of technological issues with third-party service providers that we use to support websites and mobile applications used by us and our clients. An internal issue or issues with vendor or industry systems and connectivity could materially impact our operations and ability to service clients, subject us to material losses, and cause reputational harm.\n\nCertain events could increase our client service and processing times due to staffing shortages, remote work or the temporary loss of services from outsourced service providers, such as occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. We consider service quality to be an important part of the client experience and our failure to meet client ex pectations could result in decreased client satisfaction.\n\nWe take steps to prevent and detect fraud but the ways that fraudulent activity is attempted is continuously evolving. Although we monitor for new types of fraud, there may be a delay in recognizing the fraud is happening. Besides potential losses, shutting down fraudulent activity often requires a balance with client experience. Instances of fraud might negatively impact our reputation and client confidence in the Company, in addition to any direct losses that might result from such instances.",

Our net interest revenue, EVE, and bank deposit account fee revenue simulations reflect the assumption of non-negative investment yields.\n\n## Liquidity Risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the potential that Schwab will be unable to sell assets or meet cash flow obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable losses.\n\nDue to its role as a source of financial strength, CSC's liquidity needs are primarily driven by the liquidity and capital needs of: CS&amp;Co, our principal broker-dealer subsidiary; the capital needs of the banking subsidiaries; principal and interest due on corporate debt; and dividend payments on CSC's preferred and common stock. The liquidity needs of our broker-dealer subsidiary are primarily driven by client activity, including trading and margin lending activities, and capital expenditures. The capital needs of the banking subsidiaries are primarily driven by client deposit levels and other borrowings. We have established liquidity policies to support the successful execution of business strategies, while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity to meet operational needs and satisfy applicable regulatory requirements under both normal and stressed conditions. We seek to maintain client confidence in the balance sheet and the safety of client assets by maintaining liquidity and diversity of funding sources to allow the Company to meet its obligations. To this end, we have established limits and contingency funding plans to support liquidity levels during both business as usual and stressed conditions.\n\nWe employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity. We conduct regular liquidity stress testing to develop a view of liquidity risk exposures and to ensure our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity during market-related or company-specific liquidity stress events. Liquidity sources are also tested periodically and results are reported to the Financial Risk Oversight Committee. A number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify emerging liquidity stresses in the market or within the organization and are reviewed with management periodically.\n\n## Funding Sources\n\nSchwab's primary source of funds is cash generated by client activity which includes bank deposits and cash balances in client brokerage accounts. These funds are used to purchase investment securities and extend loans to clients. Other sources of funds may include cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities, repayments on loans, securities lending of assets held in client brokerage accounts, FHLB borrowings, borrowings under repurchase agreements with external financial institutions, issuance of CDs, cash provided by securities issuances by CSC in the capital markets, and other facilities described below.\n\nTo meet daily funding needs, we maintain liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and short-term investments. For unanticipated liquidity needs, we also maintain a buffer of highly liquid investments, including U.S. Treasury securities. Our clients' bank deposits and brokerage cash balances primarily originate from our 36.5 million active brokerage accounts. More than 80% of our bank deposits qualified for FDIC insurance as of December 31, 2024. Our clients' allocation of cash held on our balance sheet as bank deposits or payables to brokerage clients is sensitive to interest rate levels, with clients typically increasing their utilization of investment cash solutions, such as purchased money market funds and certain fixed income products when those yields are higher than those of cash sweep features.\n\nAs a participant in the financial services industry, Schwab relies on access to ex ternal financing in the normal course of business. Schwab's use of external debt facilities may arise from timing differences between cash flow requirements, such as client cash outflows, cash flows from operations, payments on interest-earning assets, movements of cash to meet regulatory brokerage client cash segregation requirements, and general corporate purposes. Rollover risk is the risk that we will not be able to refinance or payoff borrowings as they mature. We maintain policies and procedures necessary to access funding, and test",

      "answer": "The difference in the Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) requirements between Citigroup and Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) for the period October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025, is 1.4% (COF: 5.5% - Citi: 4.1%). This difference contributes to a lower minimum CET1 capital ratio under the Standardized Approach for Citigroup (12.1%) compared to COF (10.0%). This outcome arises because Citi's SCB is combined with a higher GSIB surcharge (3.5%) than COF (which is not subject to a GSIB surcharge), and both are subject to the fixed 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer. Therefore, the SCB and GSIB surcharge structure directly influence the overall minimum CET1 capital requirements for each institution.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Citigroup's SCB is 4.1% for the period October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025, and its GSIB surcharge is 3.5%. Its minimum CET1 capital ratio under the Standardized Approach is 12.1%.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Capital One Financial Corporation's SCB is 5.5% for the same period, and it is not subject to a GSIB surcharge. Its minimum CET1 capital ratio under the Standardized Approach is 10.0%.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The SCB difference (5.5% for COF vs. 4.1% for Citi) is offset in Citi's case by a GSIB surcharge of 3.5%, which COF does not face. This leads to a lower CET1 capital requirement for COF despite its higher SCB."

          "chunk_text": "Citi is not subject to payout limitations as a result of the U.S. Basel III requirements.\n\n## Stress Capital Buffer\n\nCitigroup is subject to the FRB's Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) rule, which integrates the annual stress testing requirements with ongoing regulatory capital requirements. The SCB equals the peak-to-trough CET1 Capital ratio decline under the Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario over a nine-quarter period used in the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and DoddFrank Act Stress Testing (DFAST), plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends, subject to a floor of 2.5%. SCB-based capital requirements are reviewed and updated annually by the FRB as part of the CCAR process. For additional information regarding CCAR and DFAST, see 'Stress Testing Component of Capital Planning' below. The fixed 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer will continue to apply under the Advanced Approaches (see below).\n\nAs of October 1, 2024, Citi's required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio decreased to 12.1% from 12.3% under the Standardized Approach, incorporating the 4.1% SCB through September 30, 2025 and Citi's current GSIB surcharge of 3.5%. Citi's required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio under the Advanced Approaches (using the fixed 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer) remains unchanged at 10.5%. The SCB applies to Citigroup only; the regulatory capital framework applicable to Citibank, including the Capital Conservation Buffer, is unaffected by Citigroup's SCB.\n\n## Capital Conservation Buffer and Countercyclical Capital Buffer\n\nCitigroup is subject to a fix ed 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer under the Advanced Approaches. Citibank is subject to the fix ed 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer under both the Advanced Approaches and the Standardized Approach.\n\nIn addition, Advanced Approaches banking organizations, such as Citigroup and Citibank, are subject to a discretionary Countercyclical Capital Buffer. The Countercyclical Capital Buffer is currently set at 0% by the U.S. banking agencies.\n\n## GSIB Surcharge\n\nThe FRB imposes a risk-based capital surcharge upon U.S. bank holding companies that are identified as GSIBs, including Citi (for information on potential changes to the GSIB surcharge, see 'Regulatory Capital Standards and Developments' and 'Risk Factors-Strategic Risks' below). The GSIB surcharge augments the SCB, Capital Conservation Buffer and, if invoked, any Countercyclical Capital Buffer.\n\nCiti, as a G SIB, is annually required to calculate a surcharge using two methods and is subject to the higher of the resulting two surcharges. The first method (method 1) is based on the Basel Committee's GSIB methodology. Under the second method (method 2), the substitutability category under the Basel Committee's GSIB methodology is replaced with a quantitative measure intended to assess a GSIB's reliance on short-term wholesale funding. In addition, method 1 incorporates relative measures of systemic importance across certain global banking organizations and a year-end spot foreign exchange rate, whereas method 2 uses fixed measures of systemic importance and application of an average foreign exchange rate over a three-year period. The GSIB surcharges calculated under both method 1 and method 2 are based on measures of systemic importance from the year immediately preceding that in which the GSIB surcharge calculations are being performed (e.g., the method 1 and method 2 GSIB surcharges calculated during 2025 will be based on 2024 systemic indicator data). Generally, Citi's surcharge determined under method 2 will be higher than its surcharge determined under method 1.\n\nShould a GSIB's systemic importance change year-over-year, such that it becomes subject to a higher GSIB surcharge, the higher surcharge would become effective on January 1 of the year that is one full calendar year after the increased G SIB surcharge was calculated (e.g., a higher surcharge calculated in 2025 using data as of December 31, 2024 would not become effective until January 1, 2027). However, if a GSIB's systemic importance changes such that the GSIB would be subject to a lower surcharge, the GSIB would be subject to the lower surcharge on January 1 of the year immediately following the calendar year in which the decreased GSIB surcharge was calculated (e.g., a lower surcharge calculated in 2025 using data as of December 31, 2024 would become effective January 1, 2026).\n\nThe following table presents Citi's effective GSIB surcharge as determined under method 1 and method 2 during 2024 and 2023:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Stress Capital Buffer Rule\n\nThe Basel III Capital Rules require banking institutions to maintain a capital conservation buffer, composed of CET1 capital, above the regulatory minimum ratios. Under the Federal Reserve's final rule to implement the stress capital buffer requirement ('Stress Capital Buffer Rule'), the Company's 'standardized approach capital conservation buffer' includes its stress capital buffer requirement (as described below), any G -SIB Surcharge (which is not applicable to us) and the countercyclical capital buffer requirement (which is currently set at 0%). Any determination to increase the countercyclical capital buffer generally would be effective twelve months after the announcement of such an increase, unless the Federal Reserve, OCC and the FDIC (collectively, 'Federal Banking Agencies') set an earlier effective date.\n\nThe Company's stress capital buffer requirement is recalibrated every year based on the Company's supervisory stress test results, as discussed below. In particular, the Company's stress capital buffer requirement equals, subject to a floor of 2.5%, the sum of (i) the difference between the Company's starting CET1 capital ratio and its lowest projected CET1 capital ratio under the severely adverse scenario of the Federal Reserve's supervisory stress test plus (ii) the ratio of the Company's projected four quarters of common stock dividends (for the fourth to seventh quarters of the planning horizon) to the projected risk-weighted assets for the quarter in which the Company's projected CET1 capital ratio reaches its minimum under the supervisory stress test.\n\nBased on the Company's 2024 supervisory stress test results, the Company's stress capital buffer requirement for the period beginning on October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025 is 5.5%. Therefore, the Company's minimum capital requirements plus the standardized approach capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios under the stress capital buffer framework are 10.0%, 11.5% and 13.5%, respectively, for the period from October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025.\n\nThe Stress Capital Buffer Rule does not apply to the Bank. Pursuant to the OCC's capital regulations, which are only applicable to the Bank, the capital conservation buffer for the Bank continues to be fixed at 2.5%. Therefore, the Bank's minimum capital requirements plus its capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios are 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%, respectively. See 'Part II-Item 7. MD&amp;A-Capital Management' and 'Part IIItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 12-Regulatory and Capital Adequacy' for additional information.\n\nIf the Company or the Bank fails to maintain its capital ratios above the minimum capital requirements plus the applicable capital conservation buffers, it will face increasingly strict automatic limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to certain executive officers.\n\nSee also 'Capital Planning and Stress Testing' below for more information about the stress capital buffer determination process.\n\n## CECL Transition Rule\n\nThe Federal Banking Agencies adopted a final rule ('CECL Transition Rule') that provides banking institutions an optional five-year transition period to phase in the impact of the current expected credit losses ('CECL') standard on their regulatory capital ('CECL Transition Election'). We adopted the CECL standard (for accounting purposes) as of January 1, 2020, and made the CECL Transition Election (for regulatory capital purposes) in the first quarter of 2020.\n\nPursuant to the CECL Transition Rule, a banking institution could elect to delay the estimated impact of adopting CECL on its regulatory capital through December 31, 2021 and then phase in the estimated cumulative impact from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. For the 'day 2' ongoing impact of CECL during the initial two years, the Federal Banking Agencies used a uniform 'scaling factor' of 25% as an approximation of the increase in the allowance under the CECL standard compared to the prior incurred loss methodology. Accordingly, from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021, electing banking institutions were permitted to add back to their regulatory capital an amount equal to the sum of the after-tax  'day 1' CECL adoption impact and 25% of the increase in the allowance since the adoption of the CECL standard. From January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024, the after-tax 'day 1' CECL adoption impact and the cumulative 'day 2' ongoing impact were being phased in to regulatory capital at 25% per year. The following table summarizes the capital impact delay and phase in period on our regulatory capital from years 2020 to 2025.\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)",

        "Step 2: Extract from source B - COF\u2019s Series M has a carrying value of $988 million as of December 31, 2024, and remains outstanding.",

          "chunk_text": "Citi is not subject to payout limitations as a result of the U.S. Basel III requirements.\n\n## Stress Capital Buffer\n\nCitigroup is subject to the FRB's Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) rule, which integrates the annual stress testing requirements with ongoing regulatory capital requirements. The SCB equals the peak-to-trough CET1 Capital ratio decline under the Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario over a nine-quarter period used in the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and DoddFrank Act Stress Testing (DFAST), plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends, subject to a floor of 2.5%. SCB-based capital requirements are reviewed and updated annually by the FRB as part of the CCAR process. For additional information regarding CCAR and DFAST, see 'Stress Testing Component of Capital Planning' below. The fixed 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer will continue to apply under the Advanced Approaches (see below).\n\nAs of October 1, 2024, Citi's required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio decreased to 12.1% from 12.3% under the Standardized Approach, incorporating the 4.1% SCB through September 30, 2025 and Citi's current GSIB surcharge of 3.5%. Citi's required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio under the Advanced Approaches (using the fixed 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer) remains unchanged at 10.5%. The SCB applies to Citigroup only; the regulatory capital framework applicable to Citibank, including the Capital Conservation Buffer, is unaffected by Citigroup's SCB.\n\n## Capital Conservation Buffer and Countercyclical Capital Buffer\n\nCitigroup is subject to a fix ed 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer under the Advanced Approaches. Citibank is subject to the fix ed 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer under both the Advanced Approaches and the Standardized Approach.\n\nIn addition, Advanced Approaches banking organizations, such as Citigroup and Citibank, are subject to a discretionary Countercyclical Capital Buffer. The Countercyclical Capital Buffer is currently set at 0% by the U.S. banking agencies.\n\n## GSIB Surcharge\n\nThe FRB imposes a risk-based capital surcharge upon U.S. bank holding companies that are identified as GSIBs, including Citi (for information on potential changes to the GSIB surcharge, see 'Regulatory Capital Standards and Developments' and 'Risk Factors-Strategic Risks' below). The GSIB surcharge augments the SCB, Capital Conservation Buffer and, if invoked, any Countercyclical Capital Buffer.\n\nCiti, as a G SIB, is annually required to calculate a surcharge using two methods and is subject to the higher of the resulting two surcharges. The first method (method 1) is based on the Basel Committee's GSIB methodology. Under the second method (method 2), the substitutability category under the Basel Committee's GSIB methodology is replaced with a quantitative measure intended to assess a GSIB's reliance on short-term wholesale funding. In addition, method 1 incorporates relative measures of systemic importance across certain global banking organizations and a year-end spot foreign exchange rate, whereas method 2 uses fixed measures of systemic importance and application of an average foreign exchange rate over a three-year period. The GSIB surcharges calculated under both method 1 and method 2 are based on measures of systemic importance from the year immediately preceding that in which the GSIB surcharge calculations are being performed (e.g., the method 1 and method 2 GSIB surcharges calculated during 2025 will be based on 2024 systemic indicator data). Generally, Citi's surcharge determined under method 2 will be higher than its surcharge determined under method 1.\n\nShould a GSIB's systemic importance change year-over-year, such that it becomes subject to a higher GSIB surcharge, the higher surcharge would become effective on January 1 of the year that is one full calendar year after the increased G SIB surcharge was calculated (e.g., a higher surcharge calculated in 2025 using data as of December 31, 2024 would not become effective until January 1, 2027). However, if a GSIB's systemic importance changes such that the GSIB would be subject to a lower surcharge, the GSIB would be subject to the lower surcharge on January 1 of the year immediately following the calendar year in which the decreased GSIB surcharge was calculated (e.g., a lower surcharge calculated in 2025 using data as of December 31, 2024 would become effective January 1, 2026).\n\nThe following table presents Citi's effective GSIB surcharge as determined under method 1 and method 2 during 2024 and 2023:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nBased on the Company's 2024 supervisory stress test results, the Company's stress capital buffer requirement for the period beginning on October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025 is 5.5%. Therefore, the Company's minimum capital requirements plus the standardized approach capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios under the stress capital buffer framework are 10.0%, 11.5% and 13.5%, respectively, for the period from October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025.\n\nThe Stress Capital Buffer Rule does not apply to the Bank. Pursuant to the OCC's capital regulations, which are only applicable to the Bank, the capital conservation buffer for the Bank continues to be fixed at 2.5%. Therefore, the Bank's minimum capital requirements plus its capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios are 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%, respectively.\n\nIf the Company or the Bank fails to maintain its capital ratios above the minimum capital requirements plus the applicable capital conservation buffers, it will face increasingly strict automatic limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to certain executive officers.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, the Company and the Bank each exceeded the minimum capital requirements and the capital conservation buffer requirements applicable to them, and the Company and the Bank were each 'well-capitalized.' The 'well-capitalized' standards applicable to the Company are established in the Federal Reserve's regulations, and the 'well-capitalized' standards applicable to the Bank are established in the OCC's PCA capital requirements.\n\n## CECL Transition Rule\n\nThe Federal Banking Agencies adopted the CECL Transition Rule that provides banking institutions an optional five-year transition period to phase in the impact of the CECL standard on their regulatory capital, the CECL Transition Election. We adopted the CECL standard (for accounting purposes) as of January 1, 2020, and made the CECL Transition Election (for regulatory capital purposes) in the first quarter of 2020. Therefore, the applicable amounts presented in this Report reflect such election.\n\nPursuant to the CECL Transition Rule, a banking institution could elect to delay the estimated impact of adopting CECL on its regulatory capital through December 31, 2021 and then phase in the estimated cumulative impact from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. For the 'day 2' ongoing impact of CECL during the initial two years, the Federal Banking Agencies used a uniform 'scaling factor' of 25% as an approximation of the increase in the allowance under the CECL standard compared to the prior incurred loss methodology. Accordingly, from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021, electing banking institutions were permitted to add back to their regulatory capital an amount equal to the sum of the after-tax  'day 1' CECL adoption impact and 25% of the increase in the allowance since the adoption of the CECL standard. From January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024, the after-tax 'day 1' CECL adoption impact and the cumulative 'day 2' ongoing impact were being phased in to regulatory capital at 25% per year. The following table summarizes the capital impact delay and phase in period on our regulatory capital from years 2020 to 2025.\n\n",

      "question": "How does the difference in total consolidated assets between Charles Schwab ($493 billion) and Wells Fargo (over $700 billion) affect their regulatory capital frameworks and eligibility for financial holding company activities under the Bank Holding Company Act?",
      "answer": "Charles Schwab, with $493 billion in total consolidated assets, falls under Category III of the regulatory capital framework. This classification subjects it to the standardized approach framework, including requirements like the stress capital buffer, capital conservation buffer, and supplementary leverage ratio, while allowing it to opt out of including accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) in regulatory capital calculations. Wells Fargo, with total consolidated assets exceeding $700 billion, falls into Category II. This higher category subjects it to stricter regulatory capital requirements, including the advanced approaches framework, which Schwab avoids due to its lower asset size. Additionally, under the Bank Holding Company Act, both companies are eligible for financial holding company (FHC) activities, but Wells Fargo\u2019s larger size and cross-jurisdictional activity expose it to more complex regulatory oversight and potentially greater limitations if it fails to maintain eligibility criteria such as 'well-capitalized' and 'well-managed' status.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Charles Schwab has $493 billion in total consolidated assets and is classified under Category III, which includes specific capital requirements and the option to exclude AOCI.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Wells Fargo exceeds $700 billion in total consolidated assets, placing it in Category II, which includes more stringent capital rules such as the advanced approaches framework.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The difference in asset size leads to different regulatory capital frameworks, with Wells Fargo facing more complex and stricter requirements. Both companies are eligible for FHC activities, but larger asset size increases regulatory scrutiny and potential consequences for non-compliance."

      "question": "How does the application of the Bank Holding Company Act (BHC Act) differ between Charles Schwab Corporation (CSC) and Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) in terms of affiliate lending restrictions and eligibility for financial holding company (FHC) activities, based on their 2023 10-K filings?",
      "answer": "Charles Schwab Corporation (CSC), by electing to be treated as a financial holding company (FHC), is subject to affiliate lending restrictions under the BHC Act that limit its depository institution subsidiaries from making loans or extensions of credit to affiliates unless those affiliates engage only in activities permissible under section 4(c) of the BHC Act. Wells Fargo & Company (WFC), also operating under the BHC Act, faces restrictions on engaging in new activities or acquiring companies engaged in non-banking activities if its subsidiary banks are not rated 'Satisfactory' under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) or if WFC or its banks are not 'well-capitalized' and 'well-managed.' Additionally, WFC could be prohibited from engaging in non-banking activities unless it receives Federal Reserve approval or corrects any deficiencies within a prescribed period. These differences highlight how the BHC Act governs affiliate lending and FHC eligibility through distinct enforcement mechanisms and compliance triggers for CSC and WFC.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - CSC's depository institution subsidiaries are restricted from making loans or credit extensions to affiliates unless those affiliates engage only in activities permissible under section 4(c) of the BHC Act.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - WFC is prohibited from engaging in new activities or acquiring companies engaged in non-banking activities if its subsidiary banks receive a CRA rating of less than 'Satisfactory' or if WFC or its banks are not 'well-capitalized' and 'well-managed.'",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both CSC and WFC are subject to the BHC Act, but the specific restrictions differ: CSC faces affiliate lending limitations tied to permissible affiliate activities under the BHC Act, while WFC faces operational restrictions based on CRA ratings and capital/management status."

      "question": "How do Wells Fargo's pay-for-performance compensation principles and Schwab's regulatory risk disclosures compare in their treatment of regulatory expectations, and what does this reveal about their respective risk management approaches?",
      "answer": "Wells Fargo directly incorporates regulatory expectations into its compensation program by making 20% of executive compensation variable and explicitly tying it to meeting regulatory requirements. This approach financially incentivizes employees to prioritize compliance with regulations. In contrast, Schwab identifies regulatory expectations as an explicit risk factor that could adversely impact its business, listing it alongside other external risks like market conditions and litigation. This reveals fundamentally different risk management strategies: Wells Fargo proactively embeds regulatory compliance into its financial incentives structure, while Schwab treats regulatory expectations as an external risk to be mitigated rather than an internal performance driver.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Schwab identifies 'Regulatory guidance and adverse impacts from new or changed legislation, rulemaking or regulatory expectations' as a specific risk factor that could negatively affect business outcomes.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Wells Fargo states that 'Pay for performance: Compensation is linked to company, line of business, and individual performance, including meeting regulatory expectations' and notes that 20% of total compensation is variable pay subject to performance conditions.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While both financial institutions acknowledge regulatory expectations, Wells Fargo actively incorporates these expectations into its compensation structure as a positive performance incentive, whereas Schwab frames regulatory expectations as an external risk factor that could negatively impact operations."

      "answer": "The USA PATRIOT Act requires both The Charles Schwab Corporation (CSC) and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. to implement anti-money laundering (AML) procedures, suspicious activity reporting, and customer due diligence. For CSC, these requirements apply to its subsidiaries that conduct financial services activities and mandate programs reasonably designed to detect and prevent money laundering and terrorism financing. Similarly, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. must comply with these AML obligations, which are enforced through federal banking regulators evaluating the effectiveness of financial institutions in combating money laundering. Both entities face increased operational costs and regulatory scrutiny due to the implementation and maintenance of these required compliance frameworks.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The Charles Schwab Corporation and its subsidiaries are subject to the USA PATRIOT Act, which requires them to implement programs reasonably designed to detect and prevent money laundering and terrorism financing.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are required to implement AML procedures under the USA PATRIOT Act, which increases their compliance burden and operational costs while also subjecting them to regulatory oversight."

      "answer": "Both Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Wells Fargo (WFC) are subject to regulatory capital and liquidity requirements that directly influence their ability to distribute capital through dividends and share repurchases. In SCHW\u2019s 2023 10-K, it is stated that regulators could require CSC or its banking subsidiaries to increase liquidity or hold more capital, which could limit the ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares. Similarly, WFC\u2019s 2023 10-K highlights that if the company or any of its subsidiary banks are not well capitalized or well managed, the FRB could require corrective actions and restrict the company from engaging in new activities or acquiring other companies. Furthermore, WFC\u2019s subsidiary banks are subject to statutory and regulatory limitations on dividend payments, and the Parent Company\u2019s liquidity could be materially impacted if the IHC is restricted from making dividend payments due to liquidity or capital metrics falling below defined triggers. These provisions demonstrate that both companies must maintain sufficient liquidity and capital, including compliance with LCR standards, to avoid regulatory constraints on capital distributions.",

We owned an aggregate of $13 million and $15 million of stock in FHLBs at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In addition, our subsidiaries have pledged securities available for sale with a fair v alue of $1.6 billion at December 31, 2024 and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2023.\n\nInvestments held in escrow accounts or otherwise subject to restriction as to their use were $73 million and $164 million, comprised of bonds available for sale and short-term investments at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nReinsurance transactions between AIG and Fortitude Re were structured as modified coinsurance (modco) and loss portfolio transfer arrangements with funds withheld.\n\n## 7. Lending Activities\n\nMortgage and other loans receivable include commercial mortgages, life insurance policy loans, commercial loans, and other loans and notes receivable. Commercial mortgages, commercial loans, and other loans and notes receivable are carried at unpaid principal balances less allowance for credit losses and plus or minus adjustments for the accretion or amortization of discount or premium. Interest income on such loans is accrued as earned.\n\nDirect costs of originating commercial mortgages, commercial loans, and other loans and notes receivable, net of nonrefundable points and fees, are deferred and included in the carrying amount of the related receivables. The amount deferred is amortized to income as an adjustment to earnings using the interest method.\n\nLife insurance policy loans are carried at unpaid principal balances. There is no allowance for policy loans because these loans serve to reduce the death benefit paid when the death claim is made and the balances are effectively collateralized by the cash surrender value of the policy.\n\nThe following table presents the composition of Mortgage and other loans receivable, net:\n\n",

      "answer": "Capital One uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge intercompany borrowings denominated in foreign currencies, which directly affects the earnings variability of these transactions. AIG, on the other hand, reports interest income from intercompany borrowings (e.g., $1 million in 2024) but eliminates this income in consolidation, as these internal transactions are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements. This shows that while both firms engage in intercompany financing, Capital One actively manages the foreign exchange risk on these loans, whereas AIG simply eliminates the internal interest income during consolidation.",

        "Step 1: Extract from AIG's filing - AIG reports interest income from intercompany borrowings (e.g., $1 million in 2024), which is eliminated in consolidation.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies have intercompany borrowings, but they handle the financial reporting and risk differently: AIG eliminates internal interest income during consolidation, while Capital One actively hedges the foreign exchange risk associated with such loans to stabilize earnings."

Our primary market risks stem from the impact on our earnings and economic value of equity due to changes in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, changes in foreign exchange rates. We manage our interest rate sensitivity by employing several techniques, which include changing the duration and re-pricing characteristics of various assets and liabilities by using interest rate derivatives. We also use foreign currency derivatives to limit our earnings and capital exposures to foreign exchange risk by hedging certain exposures denominated in foreign currencies. We primarily use interest rate and foreign currency swaps to perform these hedging activities, but we may also use a variety of other derivative instruments, including caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts, to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks. We designate these risk management derivatives as either qualifying accounting hedges or free-standing derivatives. Qualifying accounting hedges are further designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges. Free-standing derivatives are economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting.\n\nWe offer interest rate, commodity, foreign currency derivatives and other contracts as an accommodation to our customers within our Commercial Banking business. We enter into these derivatives with our customers primarily to help them manage their interest rate risks, hedge their energy and other commodities exposures, and manage foreign currency fluctuations. We offset the substantial majority of the market risk exposure of our customer accommodation derivatives through derivative transactions with other counterparties.\n\nSee below for additional information on our use of derivatives and how we account for them:\n\n- Fair Value Hedges: We designate derivatives as fair value hedges when they are used to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities, which fluctuate in value as a result of movements in interest rates. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are presented in the same line item in our consolidated statements of income as the earnings effect of the hedged items. We enter into receive-fix ed, pay-float interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of outstanding fix ed rate debt and deposits due to fluctuations in market interest rates. We also enter into pay-fix ed, receive-float interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of fixed rate investment securities.\n- Cash Flow Hedges: We designate derivatives as cash flow hedges when they are used to manage our exposure to variability in cash flows related to forecasted transactions. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of AOCI. Those amounts are reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged forecasted transactions impact earnings and presented in the same line item in our consolidated statements of income as the earnings effect of the hedged items. We enter into receive-fixed, pay-float interest rate swaps and interest rate floors to modify the interest rate characteristics of designated credit card and commercial loans from floating to fixed in order to reduce the impact of changes in forecasted future cash flows due to fluctuations in market interest rates. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows related to intercompany borrowings denominated in foreign currencies.\n- Net Investment Hedges: We use net investment hedges to manage the foreign currency exposure related to our net investments in foreign operations that have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are recorded in the translation adjustment component of AOCI, offsetting the translation gain or loss from those foreign operations. We execute net investment hedges using foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the translation exposure of the net investment in our foreign operations under the forward method.\n- Free-Standing Derivatives: Our free-standing derivatives primarily consist of our customer accommodation derivatives and other economic hedges. The customer accommodation derivatives and the related offsetting contracts are mainly interest rate, commodity and foreign currency contracts. The other free-standing derivatives are primarily used to economically hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of our commercial mortgage loan origination and purchase commitments as well as other interests held. Changes in the fair value of free-standing derivatives are recorded in earnings as a component of other non-interest income.\n\n## CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

In contrast, Charles Schwab significantly reduced its brokered CD balances by approximately 18% from the peak balances reached in May 2023 to year-end, as part of its strategy to manage its balance sheet and leverage ratio. This indicates that while American Express maintained a relatively stable reliance on brokered CDs, Charles Schwab actively reduced its reliance on this funding source.",

      "answer": "$13,331 million in 2022 to $12,960 million in 2023, representing a $371 million decrease. Conversely, SCHW explicitly mentions relying on brokered CDs as part of its supplemental funding strategy in 2023 due to rapid interest rate increases and client reallocation from sweep cash to higher-yielding investments. This reveals a divergence in liquidity strategies: AXP experienced a reduction in brokered CD balances while SCHW leaned more heavily on this funding source to manage liquidity needs in a rising interest rate environment.",

      "answer": "AXP reported $12,960 million in third-party (brokered) CDs for 2023, while SCHW had an average balance of $36.0 billion in brokered CDs during the same year. This indicates that SCHW had a significantly higher reliance on brokered CDs as a funding source compared to AXP. Furthermore, SCHW's brokered CD balance increased substantially from $437 million in 2022 to $36.0 billion in 2023, showing a strategic shift toward using more third-party funding to support client cash allocations in a rising interest rate environment. In contrast, AXP's brokered CDs slightly declined from $13,331 million in 2022 to $12,960 million in 2023, suggesting a more stable or reduced emphasis on this funding channel.",

These results are used to understand exposures and are measured against limits. In contrast, AIG uses its stress testing framework to assess aggregate exposure to significant financial and insurance risks, and the results are used to determine the resources needed at the AIG Parent level to support subsidiaries and maintain consolidated company target capitalization levels. This reflects that JPMorgan Chase focuses on integrating stress outcomes into risk tolerance limits and governance structures, while AIG applies stress testing to evaluate capital adequacy and diversification benefits across business lines.",

      "question": "How does the integration of the Risk Appetite Framework with strategic capital allocation differ between AIG's enterprise risk management approach and JPM's investment securities risk governance, given AIG's three-tiered risk limit hierarchy and JPM's $569.2 billion investment securities portfolio?",
      "answer": "AIG integrates its Risk Appetite Framework with strategic capital allocation through a three-tiered risk limit hierarchy that includes Board-level risk tolerances, AIG management-level limits, and Business Unit and Legal Entity-level limits. This structured approach ensures that capital and liquidity levels align with strategic business goals while meeting regulatory and rating agency expectations. In contrast, JPM applies its Risk Appetite Framework to investment securities risk governance by establishing approved levels for each risk category, including capital and credit risks, within its $569.2 billion investment securities portfolio. JPM\u2019s approach emphasizes high-quality securities (average credit rating AA+) and regular oversight by the CTC Risk Committee and Board Risk Committee, aligning risk governance with balance sheet and asset-liability management objectives.",

        "Step 1: From AIG's filing, extract the three-tiered risk limit hierarchy (Board-level, AIG management-level, and Business Unit/legal entity-level) and its alignment with strategic capital allocation.",
        "Step 2: From JPM's filing, extract the $569.2 billion size of the investment securities portfolio and its average credit rating (AA+), as well as the governance structure involving the CTC Risk Committee and Board Risk Committee.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize by comparing how each firm integrates the Risk Appetite Framework with strategic capital allocation\u2014AIG through a structured multi-tier limit system and JPM through risk category limits and portfolio quality controls."

      "question": "What is the weighted average interest rate difference between AIG's and JPM's Junior Subordinated Debt balances as of December 31, 2023, and what does this difference suggest about their respective risk profiles in financing strategies?",
      "answer": "The weighted average interest rate for AIG's Junior Subordinated Debt is 6.53%, calculated from a total balance of $992 million with an interest rate range of 4.88% to 8.18%. For JPM, the weighted average interest rate is 7.14%, derived from a total Junior Subordinated Debt balance of $163,283 million, with fixed-rate debt carrying rates ranging from 6.18% to 7.45%. The 0.61% interest rate differential indicates that JPM's financing through junior subordinated debt is perceived as riskier compared to AIG's, likely reflecting differences in creditworthiness, capital structure, or market positioning within the financial sector.",

      "question": "How do the distinct governance structures for Operational Risk Management Policies at Capital One (COF) and Charles Schwab (SCHW) reflect differences in their approaches to managing cyber and technology risk, and which company includes a dedicated sub-committee specifically for cybersecurity oversight?",
      "answer": "Capital One (COF) manages cyber and technology risk through its Operational Risk Management Program, which is overseen by the Chief Operational Risk Officer in collaboration with the Chief Technology Risk Officer (CTRO), and includes these risks under broader operational risk reporting to senior leadership and the Board. Charles Schwab (SCHW), on the other hand, has a more granular governance structure through its Operational Risk Oversight Committee, which includes a dedicated sub-committee specifically for Information Security and Cybersecurity. This indicates that while both companies address cyber and technology risk within their operational risk frameworks, Schwab has a more specialized oversight mechanism for cybersecurity.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From COF's 10-K, extract that the Chief Operational Risk Officer collaborates with the CTRO to manage operational risk, including cyber and technology risk, and that these risks are reported to senior leadership and the Board under the broader Operational Risk Management Program.",
        "Step 2: From SCHW's 10-K, extract that the Operational Risk Oversight Committee includes a specific sub-committee for Information Security and Cybersecurity, indicating a more specialized governance approach for this risk category.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the differences in governance structures: COF integrates cyber and technology risk into general operational risk reporting, while SCHW has a dedicated sub-committee focused solely on cybersecurity."

      "question": "What is the maximum potential borrowing capacity Charles Schwab could obtain under the Bank Term Funding Program based on its available investment securities, and how does this relate to the tangible capital requirements for accessing such funding?",
      "answer": "Charles Schwab had investment securities with a par value of approximately $142 billion available to be pledged as collateral, which could provide additional borrowing capacity of up to $142 billion under the Bank Term Funding Program. However, Schwab's banking subsidiaries must maintain positive tangible capital, defined as common equity less goodwill and intangible assets, in order to place new draws upon these credit facilities. This means that while the full $142 billion may be technically available based on pledged assets, actual borrowing capacity is also constrained by the level of tangible capital held by the banking subsidiaries.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From SCHW's 10-K filing, identify the amount of investment securities available to be pledged as collateral for secured borrowing facilities - $142 billion par value.",
        "Step 2: From SCHW's 10-K filing, note that borrowing capacity under the Bank Term Funding Program is dependent on the par value of investment securities pledged as collateral.",
        "Step 3: From SCHW's 10-K filing, identify the requirement to maintain positive tangible capital (common equity less goodwill and intangible assets) to access secured credit facilities like the Bank Term Funding Program.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The maximum potential borrowing capacity is $142 billion based on available securities, but actual borrowing is also limited by tangible capital requirements."

BUSINESS\n\n## Description of Business\n\nThe Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, a Delaware corporation (NYSE symbol: BK), is a global company headquartered in New York, New York, with $46.7 trillion in assets under custody and/or administration and $2.4 trillion in assets under management as of Dec. 31, 2021. With its subsidiaries, BNY Mellon has been in business since 1784.\n\nWe previously divided our businesses into two business segments, Investment Services and Investment and Wealth Management. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we disaggregated our Investment Services business segment into two new business segments, Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services. Our Investment and Wealth Management business segment was not impacted by this resegmentation. We also have an Other segment, which includes the leasing portfolio, corporate treasury activities (including our securities portfolio), derivatives and other trading activity, corporate and bank-owned life insurance, renewable energy and other corporate investments and certain business exits.\n\nFor a further discussion of BNY Mellon's lines of business, products and services, see the 'Overview,' 'Summary of financial highlights,' 'Fee and other revenue,' 'Review of business segments' and 'International operations' sections in the MD&amp;A section in the Annual Report and Notes 24 and 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report, of which portions are incorporated herein by reference. See the 'Available Information' section on page 1 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference, for a description of how to access financial and other information regarding BNY Mellon.\n\nOur two principal U.S. banking subsidiaries engage in trust and custody activities, investment management services, banking services and various securities-related activities. Our two principal U.S. banking subsidiaries are:\n\n- The Bank of New York Mellon, a New York state-chartered bank, which houses our Securities Services businesses, including Asset Servicing and Issuer Services and certain Market and Wealth Services businesses, including Treasury\n- Services and Clearance and Collateral Management, as well as the bank-advised business of Investment Management; and\n- BNY Mellon, National Association ('BNY Mellon, N.A.'), a national bank, which houses our Wealth Management business and certain activities of our Pershing businesses.\n\nWe have four other U.S. bank and/or trust company subsidiaries concentrating on trust products and services across the United States: The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association, BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware, BNY Mellon Investment Servicing Trust Company and BNY Mellon Trust Company of Illinois. Most of our Investment Management business and Pershing businesses are direct or indirect non-bank subsidiaries of BNY Mellon.\n\nEach of our bank and trust company subsidiaries is subject to regulation by the applicable bank regulatory authority. The deposits of our U.S. banking subsidiaries are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent provided by law.\n\nBNY Mellon's banking subsidiaries outside the United States are subject to regulation by non-U.S. regulatory authorities in addition to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the 'Federal Reserve').  The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV ('BNY Mellon SA/NV') is the main banking subsidiary of The Bank of New York Mellon in continental Europe.

We  have  accrued  $35  million  of  deferred  U.S.  state  income  and  foreign  withholding  taxes  on  the  $8.4  billion  of undistributed foreign earnings.\n\nWe benefit from agreements concluded in certain jurisdictions, most significantly Singapore and, through 2019, Luxembourg. In December 2019, a new agreement was concluded in Singapore. The new agreement took effect January 1, 2021 and will be in effect from 2021 through 2030. In December 2019, the Luxembourg government passed legislation confirming that tax agreements granted before January 1, 2015 will no longer be binding after December 31, 2019. These agreements result in significantly lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investment and employment in those jurisdictions. We  review  our  compliance  on  an  annual  basis  to  ensure  we  continue  to  meet  our  obligations  under  these  agreements.  These agreements  resulted  in  tax  savings  of  approximately  $327  million,  $596  million,  and  $472  million  in  2021,  2020,  and  2019, respectively. The benefit of these agreements on our net income per share (diluted) was approximately $0.28, $0.50, and $0.40 in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\n\nThe following table reflects changes in unrecognized tax benefits for the periods presented below:\n\n",

      "question": "BK's 2022 10-K filing references certifications under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act filed in its 2021 Form 10-Q, while PYPL's 2022 10-K explicitly links its executive compensation framework to diversity, inclusion, and belonging (DIE&B) considerations as part of its 2021 annual incentive program. How does the integration of governance and compliance mechanisms in these filings reflect distinct approaches to aligning executive accountability with regulatory and strategic objectives?",
      "answer": "BK demonstrates executive accountability through mandatory certifications under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\u2014specifically, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer certifications (Exhibits 31.1, 31.2, 32.1, and 32.2) filed under its 2021 Form 10-Q and referenced in the 2022 10-K. These certifications ensure compliance with regulatory financial reporting requirements. In contrast, PYPL aligns executive accountability with strategic DIE&B goals by integrating these considerations into its executive compensation framework and annual performance evaluations as part of the 2021 annual incentive program. This reflects a broader governance approach where accountability extends beyond regulatory compliance to include strategic organizational values and long-term cultural outcomes.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from BK's filing - The 2022 10-K filing includes references to certifications (Exhibits 31.1, 31.2, 32.1, and 32.2) required under Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which were filed in the 2021 Form 10-Q. These certifications are mechanisms to ensure executive accountability in financial reporting.",
        "Step 2: Extract from PYPL's filing - The 2022 10-K discloses that PYPL integrated DIE&B considerations into its executive compensation framework and annual performance evaluations as part of the 2021 annual incentive program, tying executive accountability to strategic inclusion goals.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - BK uses formal regulatory certifications to align executive responsibility with financial reporting compliance, while PYPL links executive performance and incentives to strategic DIE&B outcomes. Both represent governance mechanisms but apply them to different domains: regulatory compliance versus organizational strategy."

      "question": "What specific entities within JPMorgan Chase are listed as Administrative Agents in PayPal's credit agreement, and how does this financial partnership contrast with BNY Mellon's competitive relationship with JPMorgan Chase in the provision of financial services?",
      "answer": "JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities Australia Limited, J.P. Morgan Europe Limited, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Toronto Branch are listed as Administrative Agents in PayPal's credit agreement. This indicates a financial services partnership between PayPal and these JPMorgan Chase entities, where JPMorgan provides administrative and potentially lending services. In contrast, BNY Mellon's filing highlights its competitive relationship with JPMorgan Chase, noting that it competes with major financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase in areas such as securities services, market and wealth services, and investment and wealth management. This demonstrates a dual dynamic where JPMorgan Chase serves as both a partner to PayPal and a competitor to BNY Mellon in the broader financial services industry.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_b - Identify the specific JPMorgan Chase entities listed as Administrative Agents in PayPal's credit agreement (JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities Australia Limited, J.P. Morgan Europe Limited, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Toronto Branch).",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - Identify BNY Mellon's competitive relationship with JPMorgan Chase in the financial services sector, particularly in securities services, market and wealth services, and investment and wealth management.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Contrast PayPal's partnership with JPMorgan Chase (as Administrative Agents in a credit agreement) with BNY Mellon's competitive stance against JPMorgan Chase in similar business lines, highlighting the dual roles JPMorgan Chase plays in the financial ecosystem."

Our Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services businesses compete with domestic and international financial services firms that offer custody services, corporate trust services, clearing services, collateral management services, credit services, securities brokerage, foreign exchange services, derivatives, depositary receipt services and integrated cash management solutions and related products, as well as a wide range of technology service providers, such as financial services data processing firms. Our Investment and Wealth Management business competes with domestic and international investment management and wealth management firms, hedge funds, investment banking companies and other financial services companies, including trust banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies, as well as a wide range of technology service providers.\n\nCompetition in the financial services industry continues to be intense. Competition is based on a number of factors including, among others, customer service and convenience, transaction execution, capital or access to capital, quality and range of products and services offered, performance, technological innovation and expertise, price, reputation and lending limits. Competition also varies based on the types of clients, customers, industries and geographies served. Our ability to continue to compete effectively also depends in large part on our ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees, while managing compensation and other costs. Our competitive position may be affected by institutions that are not similarly subject to extensive regulation, and as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services.\n\nFor additional discussion regarding competition, see 'MD&amp;A Risk Factors - Strategic Risk - We are subject to competition in all aspects of our business, which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability' and 'MD&amp;A - Risk Factors - Operational Risk - Our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract, retain and motivate employees' in the Annual Report, which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nThe information required by this Item is set forth in the Annual Report under 'MD&amp;A - Risk Factors,' which portion is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n## ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\n\nNone.\n\n## ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\n\nOur corporate headquarters, located at 240 Greenwich Street in New York City, is a 23-story building of approximately 1.2 million square feet that we own.\n\nWe have additional offices and commercial space in the U.S. and elsewhere in the Americas, primarily Brazil and Canada, which together consist of approximately 5.8 million square feet of leased and owned space.\n\nIn Europe, the Middle East and Africa (our 'EMEA' region), we have offices that total approximately 1.3 million square feet of leased and owned space and we have 1.5 million square feet of leased space in our Asia-Pacific ('APAC') region.\n\nOur global facilities are used across our business segments for corporate purposes. In the preceding paragraphs, square footage figures do not include excess space that has been subleased to third parties. We regularly evaluate our space capacity in relation to current and projected needs. We have incurred and may in the future incur costs if we reduce our space capacity or commit to, or occupy, new properties in",

Charles Schwab Trust Bank, on the other hand, serves as a custodian for retirement plan assets by holding them directly or through brokerage accounts, offering a self-directed brokerage solution known as the Schwab Personal Choice Retirement Account, which allows for broader investment flexibility and integration with independent retirement plan providers.",

A portion of the deferred carried interest m ay also be paid to certain em ployees. T he ultim ate tim ing of the recognition of perform ance fee revenue and related com pensation expense, if any, is unknown.\n\nTechnology services revenue. The C om pany offers investm ent m anagem ent technology system s, risk m anagem ent services, wealth m anagem ent and digital distribution tools, all on a fee basis. C lients include banks, insurance com panies, official institutions, pension funds, asset m anagers, retail distributors and other investors. F ees earned for technology services are prim arily recorded as services are perform ed over tim e and are generally determ ined using the value of positions on the Aladdin platform , or on a fixed-rate basis. R evenue derived from  the sale of software licenses is recognized upon the granting of access rights.\n\nDistribution Fees. The C om pany earns distribution and service fees related to distributing investm ent products and shareholder support services for investm ent portfolios. D istribution fees are passed-through to third-party distributors, which perform  various fund distribution services and shareholder servicing of certain funds on the C om pany's behalf, and are recognized as distribution and servicing costs. T he C om pany presents distribution fees and related distribution and servicing costs incurred on a gross basis.\n\nDistribution fees prim arily consist of ongoing distribution fees, shareholder servicing fees and upfront sales com m issions for serving as the principal underwriter and/or distributor for certain m anaged m utual funds. T he service of distribution is satisfied at the point in tim e when an investor m akes an investm ent in a share class of the m anaged m utual funds. F ees are generally considered variable consideration because they are based on the value of AU M  and are uncertain on trade date. Accordingly, the C om pany recognizes distribution fees when the am ounts becom e known and the portion recognized in the current period m ay relate to distribution services perform ed in prior periods. U pfront sales com m issions are recognized on a trade date basis. Shareholder servicing fees are based on AU M  and recognized in revenue as the services are perform ed.\n\nAdvisory and other revenue. Advisory and other revenue prim arily includes fees earned for advisory services, fees earned for transition m anagem ent services prim arily com prised of commissions recognized in connection with buying and selling securities on behalf of custom ers, and equity m ethod investm ent earnings related to certain strategic investm ents.\n\nAdvisory services fees are determ ined using fixed-rate fees and are recognized over tim e as the related services are com pleted.\n\nCommissions related to transition m anagem ent services are recorded on a trade-date basis as transactions occur.\n\nStock-based Compensation . T he C om pany recognizes com pensation cost for equity classified awards based on the grant-date fair value of the award. T he com pensation cost is recognized over the period during which an em ployee is required to provide service (usually the vesting period) in exchange for the stock-based award.\n\nThe Com pany generally m easures the grant-date fair value of restricted stock units ('R SU s') using the C om pany's stock price on the date of grant. T he grant-date fair value related to the October 2024 incentive retention R SU s granted in connection with the G IP  T ransaction, are reduced by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the shares during the vesting period discounted at the appropriate risk-free interest rate, given that they are not entitled to participate in dividends until they vest (See N ote 3, Acquisitions and Note 18, Stock-Based Compensation for further inform ation on the G I P  T ransaction). Stock-based awards m ay have perform ance, m arket and/or service conditions. F or em ployee stock options and awards with m arket conditions, the C om pany uses pricing m odels. C om pensation cost for awards containing perform ance conditions is recognized if it is probable that the conditions will be achieved. T he probability of achievem ent is assessed on a quarterly basis. If a stock-based award is m odified after the grant-date, increm ental compensation cost is recognized for an am ount equal to the excess of the fair value of the m odified award over the fair value of the original award im m ediately before the modification. Awards under the C om pany's stock-based com pensation plans vest over various periods. C om pensation cost is recorded by the C om pany on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separate vesting portion of the award as if the award is, in-substance, m ultiple awards and is adjusted for actual forfeitures as they occur.\n\nThe Com pany am ortizes the grant-date fair value of stock-based com pensation awards m ade to retirem ent-eligible em ployees over the requisite service period. U pon notification of retirem ent, the C om pany accelerates the unam ortized portion of the award over the contractually required retirem ent notification period.\n\nThe Com pany recognizes all excess tax benefits and deficiencies in incom e tax expense on the consolidated statem ents of incom e, which results in volatility of incom e tax expense as a result of fluctuations in the C om pany's stock price. Accordingly, the C om pany recorded a discrete incom e tax benefit of $37 m illion, $41 m illion and $87 m illion during 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, for vested R SU s where the grant date stock price was lower than the vesting date stock price.\n\nDistribution and Servicing Costs . D istribution and servicing costs include paym ents to third parties, prim arily associated with distribution and servicing of client investm ents in certain BlackR ock products. D istribution and servicing costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nDirect Fund Expense . D irect fund expense, which is expensed as incurred, prim arily consists of third-party non-advisory expense incurred by BlackR ock related to certain investm ent products for the use of certain index tradem arks, reference data for certain indices, custodial services, fund adm inistration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services, audit and tax services as well as other fund-related expense directly attributable to the non-advisory operations of the fund.\n\nLeases . T he C om pany determ ines if a contract is a lease or contains a lease at inception. T he C om pany accounts for its office facility leases as operating leases, which m ay include escalation clauses that are based on an index or m arket rate. T he C om pany accounts for lease and non-lease com ponents, including com m on areas m aintenance charges, as a single component for its leases. The C om pany elected the short-term  lease exception for leases with an initial term  of 12 m onths or less. C onsequently, such leases are not recorded on the consolidated statem ents of financial condition. T he C om pany's lease term s include options to extend or term inate the lease when it is reasonably certain they will be exercised or not.",

Off-Platform Sales offers proprietary mutual funds, ETFs, and collective trust funds (CTFs) outside the Company and not on the Schwab platform. They are included within the Investor Services segment given their leveraging of the products and services offered to individual investors.\n\n## Advisor Services\n\nMore than thirty years ago, Schwab supported a small group of entrepreneurial advisors who challenged the industry by creating independent firms. Through the Advisor Services segment, Schwab has become one of the largest providers of custodial, trading, banking, and support services to RIAs and their clients. Management believes that we can maintain our competitive position primarily through the efforts of our sales, support, technology, and business consulting teams, which are dedicated to helping RIAs grow, compete, and succeed in serving their clients. In addition to focusing on superior service, we utilize technology to provide RIAs with a highly-developed, scalable platform for administering their clients' assets easily and efficiently. Advisor Services sponsors and hosts a variety of national, regional, local, and virtual events designed to help RIAs of all sizes and complex ities identify and implement better ways to ex pand and efficiently manage their practices.\n\nRIAs who custody client accounts at Schwab may use proprietary software that provides them with up-to-date client account information as well as trading capabilities. The Advisor Services website is the core platform for RIAs to conduct daily business activities online with Schwab, including viewing and managing client account information and accessing news and market information. The website provides account servicing capabilities for RIAs, including account opening, money movement, transfer of assets, trading, checking status, and communicating with our service team. The site provides multi-year archiving of statements, trade confirms, and tax reports, along with document search capabilities.

As an example, we offer Schwab Advisor Portfolio Connect , a simplified portfolio management solution that is available free of charge to advisors to manage Schwab accounts. It delivers core capabilities and features through an intuitive modern experience, without the need to download and reconcile data. \u00ae\n\nThe Advisor Services website also provides interactive tools, educational content, and thought leadership for advisors turning independent. We offer a variety of services to help RIAs grow and manage their practices, including business, technology, and operations consulting on a range of topics critical to an RIA's success, as well as an annual RIA benchmarking study to help firms understand key business metrics relative to peers. We also offer an array of services to help advisors establish their own independent practices through a robust prospect consulting offer.

      "question": "How does the mention of geopolitical unrest as a risk factor in BlackRock's 2024 10-K compare with Charles Schwab's characterization of the broader economic environment, particularly in relation to their respective financial outlooks and risk management strategies?",
      "answer": "BlackRock identifies geopolitical unrest as a specific risk factor that could adversely affect the general economy, domestic and local financial and capital markets, specific industries, or BlackRock itself. This risk is explicitly included among other key risk factors that could materially differ actual results from historical or forward-looking statements. In contrast, Charles Schwab references geopolitical unrest as part of a broader macroeconomic context that includes tight monetary policy and moderating inflation. Schwab notes that despite these challenges, credit quality metrics in its bank loans portfolio have improved, with nonaccrual loans increasing only slightly from $15 million (2023) to $35 million (2024). Schwab's outlook reflects sustained benchmark lending rates and stable unemployment, suggesting a more resilient position within the same economic environment. The difference in framing highlights how BlackRock emphasizes geopolitical risk as a direct threat to its business, while Schwab integrates it into a broader economic outlook with a focus on credit resilience.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - BlackRock explicitly lists geopolitical unrest as a material risk factor that could affect its business, financial condition, and results of operations.",

Amid slower hiring and moderating inflation, the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds target overnight rate by 100 basis points in the second half of 2024. Management's macroeconomic outlook reflects sustained current benchmark lending rates, with unemployment remaining relatively flat and modest home price appreciation. Though higher mortgage rates are softening demand and reducing borrower affordability, we expect constrained housing supply to keep home prices relatively stable. Furthermore, credit quality metrics in the Company's bank loans portfolio remain very strong and have improved in recent quarters. As a result of these factors, we decreased projected loss rates at December 31, 2024, as compared to December 31, 2023.\n\nBank loan-related nonperforming assets consisted of nonaccrual loans of $35 million and $15 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Nonaccrual loans include nonaccrual troubled debt restructurings recorded prior to the adoption of ASU 2022-02, ' Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures ' on January 1, 2023. At both December 31, 2024 and 2023, loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty were not material.\n\n## Credit Quality\n\nIn addition to monitoring delinquency, Schwab monitors the credit quality of First Mortgages and HELOCs by stratifying the portfolios by the following:\n\n- Year of origination;\n- Borrower FICO scores at origination (Origination FICO);\n- Updated borrower FICO scores (Updated FICO);\n- Loan-to-value (LTV) ratios at origination (Origination LTV); and\n- Estimated Current LTV ratios (Estimated Current LTV).\n\nBorrowers' FICO scores are provided by an independent third-party credit reporting service and are generally updated quarterly. The Origination LTV and Estimated Current LTV for a HELOC include any first lien mortgage outstanding on the same property at the time of the HELOC's origination. The Estimated Current LTV for each loan is updated on a monthly basis by reference to a home price appreciation index.\n\nThe credit quality indicators of the Company's First Mortgages and HELOCs are detailed below:",

      "answer": "BAC employs a risk framework to manage credit derivatives exposure by defining risk tolerances and setting limits to ensure credit risk-related losses remain within acceptable, predefined thresholds. This internal framework is used proactively to manage risk rather than relying solely on notional amounts as indicators of exposure. In contrast, WFC is subject to a formalized risk governance framework mandated by the OCC, which requires covered banks to establish and adhere to written risk governance policies. This framework formalizes roles and responsibilities for risk management and imposes specific risk oversight duties on the board of directors. Non-compliance with this framework or failure to correct deficiencies could lead to regulatory actions such as stress testing failures, governance penalties, or even forced divestitures, making the enforcement mechanism for WFC significantly more regulatory and punitive compared to BAC's internally driven risk framework.",

          "chunk_text": "acquiring companies engaged in financial activities without prior FRB approval. If the FHC fails to correct any such condition within a prescribed period, the FRB could order the FHC to divest any of its banking subsidiaries or, in the alternativ e, to cease engaging in financial activ ities.\n\nInterstate Banking .  A  BHC may acquire banks in states other than its home state, subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time, not to exceed five years, and the requirement that the BHC not control, prior to or following the proposed acquisition, more than 10% of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or, unless the acquisition is the bank holding company's initial entry into the state, more than 30% of such deposits in the state (or such lesser or greater amount set by the state). Banks are also authorized to merge across state lines, subject to the same deposit limits noted above, thereby creating interstate branches. Banks are also permitted to acquire and to establish new branches in other states. Regulatory Approval. In determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition, federal banking regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition, financial condition, and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels, the competence, experience, and integrity of management and record of compliance with laws and regulations, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including the acquiring institution's record of compliance under the CRA, the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities and the risk to the stability of the United States banking system.\n\n## Holding Company Structure\n\nTransfer of Funds from Subsidiary Banks. The Parent's subsidiary banks are subject to restrictions under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or other assets from such subsidiaries to the Parent and its nonbank subsidiaries (including affiliates) in so-called 'cov ered transactions.' In general, covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit, investments and asset purchases, as well as certain other transactions involving the transfer of v alue from a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate. Unless an exemption applies, covered transactions by a subsidiary bank with a single affiliate are limited to 10% of the subsidiary bank's capital and surplus and, with respect to all covered transactions with affiliates in the aggregate, to 20% of the subsidiary bank's capital and surplus. A lso, loans and extensions of credit to affiliates generally must be secured by qualifying collateral. A  bank's transactions with its nonbank affiliates are also generally required to be on arm's length terms. The Parent's subsidiary banks are also subject to lending limits and qualitative requirements on loans to executive officers, directors and principal shareholders of the Parent and its subsidiary banks.\n\nSource of Strength. The FRB has a policy that a BHC is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and, under appropriate circumstances, to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank. This support may be required at times when the BHC may not have the resources to provide the support.\n\nThe OCC may order an assessment of the Parent if the capital of one of its national bank subsidiaries were to become impaired. If the Parent failed to pay the assessment within three months, the OCC could order the sale of the Parent's stock in the national bank to cover the deficiency.\n\nDepositor Preference. In the ev ent of the 'liquidation or other resolution' of an insured depository institution, the claims of deposits payable in the United States (including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, claims of insured and uninsured U.S. depositors, along with claims of the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured creditors, including the Parent, and depositors whose deposits are solely payable at such insured depository institution's non-U.S. offices.\n\nLiability of Commonly Controlled Institutions. The Company's subsidiaries include banks in the U.S., such as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A ., that are insured by the FDIC. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI A ct), insured depository institutions can be held liable for any loss incurred, or reasonably expected to be incurred, by the FDIC due to the default of an insured depository institution controlled by the same BHC, and for any assistance provided by the FDIC to an insured depository institution that is in danger of default and that is controlled by the same BHC. 'Default' means generally the appointment of a conservator or receiver. 'In danger of default' means generally the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance.\n\nEnhanced supervision and regulation of systemically important firms . The Dodd-Frank Act grants broad authority to federal banking regulators to establish enhanced supervisory and regulatory requirements for systemically important firms. The FRB has finalized a number of regulations implementing enhanced prudential requirements for large BHCs like Wells Fargo regarding risk-based capital and leverage, risk and liquidity management, single counterparty credit limits, and imposing debt-to-equity limits on any BHC that regulators determine poses a grave threat to the financial stability  of the United States. The FRB and OCC have also finalized rules implementing stress testing requirements for large BHCs and national banks. Furthermore, to promote a BHC's safety and soundness and the financial and operational resilience of its operations, the FRB has finalized guidance regarding effective boards of directors of large BHCs. The OCC, under separate authority, has finalized guidelines establishing heightened governance and risk management standards for large national banks such as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The OCC guidelines require covered banks to establish and adhere to a written risk governance framework to manage and control their risk-taking activ ities. The guidelines also formaliz e roles and responsibilities for risk management practices within covered banks and create certain risk oversight responsibilities for their boards of directors.\n\n## Regulatory Capital, Leverage and Liquidity Requirements\n\nThe Company and each of our insured depository institutions are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity requirements administered by the FRB and the OCC. The capital rules implement Basel III risk-based capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations and, among other things, establish required minimum ratios relating capital to different categories of assets and exposures. Federal banking regulators have also imposed a leverage ratio and supplementary leverage ratio on large BHCs, like Wells Fargo, and their insured depository institutions, as well as a liquidity coverage ratio and a net stable funding ratio. In addition, the Company is required to have a minimum amount of equity and unsecured long-term debt, often",

At  December  3 1,  202 4,  the Corporation had reserved 552 million unissued shares of common stock for future issuances under employee stock plans, convertible notes and preferred stock.\n\n## Preferred Stock\n\nThe cash dividends declared on preferred stock were $1.6 billion in 202 4, 2023 and 2022.\n\nDuring 202 4, the Corporation fully redeemed Series X, Series U, Series JJ and Series Z stock at their liquidation preference values for a total of $5.3 billion.\n\nAll series of preferred stock in the Preferred Stock Summary table have a par value of $0.01 per share, are not subject to the operation of a sinking fund, have no participation rights, and with the exception of the Series L Preferred Stock, are not convertible.  The  holders  of  th e  Series  B  Preferred   Stock  and   Series  1  th rough   5 Preferred Stock have general voting rights and vote together with the common stock. The holders of the other series included in the table have no general voting rights. All outstanding series of preferred stock of the Corporation have preference over the Corporation's  common  stock  with  respect  to  the  payment  of  dividends  and distribution of the Corporation's assets in the event of a liquidation or dissolution. With the exception of the Series B, F and G Preferred Stock, if any dividend payable on these series is in arrears for three or more semi-annual or six or more quarterly dividend periods, as applicable (whether consecutive or not), the holders of these series  and  any  other  class  or  series  of  preferred  stock  ranking  equally  as  to payment of dividends and upon which equivalent voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable (voting as a single class) will be entitled to vote for the election of two additional directors. These voting rights terminate when the Corporation has paid in full dividends on these series for at least two semi-annual or four quarterly dividend periods, as applicable, following the dividend arrearage.\n\nThe 7.25%  Non-Cumulative  Perpetual  Convertible  Preferred  Stock,  Series  L (Series L Preferred Stock) does not have early redemption/call rights. Each share of the  Series  L  Preferred  Stock  may  be  converted  at  any  time,  at  th e  option  of  th e holder,  into 20  shares  of  the  Corporation's  common  stock  plus  cash  in  lieu  of fractional shares. The Corporation may cause some or all of the Series L Preferred Stock, at its option, at any time or from time to time, to be converted into shares of common stock at the then-applicable conversion rate if, for 20 trading days during any  period  of 30  consecutive  trading  days,  the  closing  price  of  common  stock exceeds 130  percent  of  the  then-applicable  conversion  price  of  the  Series  L Preferred Stock. If a conversion of Series L Preferred Stock occurs at the option of the holder, subsequent to a dividend record date but prior to the dividend payment date, the Corporation will still pay any accrued dividends payable.\n\nThe following table presents a summary of perpetual preferred stock outstanding at December 31, 2024.",

      "answer": "MetLife emphasizes adaptability to market changes, financial strength, and technological efficiency as key differentiators in the competitive life insurance industry. This is evident in their focus on underwriting many group insurance products annually and the potential for group purchasers to seek more favorable terms from competitors. Wells Fargo, on the other hand, highlights the impact of a stringent banking regulatory framework, noting that statutes, regulations, and policies could restrict diversification, acquisitions, and dividend payments. Additionally, Wells Fargo invested approximately $200 million in employee learning and development programs in 2023 to enhance effectiveness and customer experience, aligning with its strategy to maintain compliance and operational excellence in a competitive and heavily regulated environment. These approaches reflect how MetLife focuses on agility and product competitiveness, while Wells Fargo prioritizes regulatory adherence and workforce development to navigate its competitive landscape.",

      "question": "How do the dividend restrictions described in both MetLife, Inc.'s and Wells Fargo & Company's 2023 10-K filings reflect regulatory constraints on their ability to distribute capital to shareholders, and what specific financial implications are highlighted in each company's disclosures?",
      "answer": "Both MetLife, Inc. and Wells Fargo & Company disclose that their ability to pay dividends is constrained by regulatory requirements that limit the amount of capital that can be distributed to shareholders. MetLife, Inc. explicitly states that it paid $1.6 billion in dividends annually from 2021 to 2023, but these payments are subject to restrictions tied to the regulatory capital and surplus of its insurance subsidiaries. Wells Fargo highlights that its subsidiary banks are subject to federal and state statutory limits on dividends, and the Parent company's liquidity and ability to pay dividends could be materially impacted if certain liquidity or capital thresholds under the Support Agreement are breached. These disclosures indicate that both companies must maintain sufficient capital levels within their regulated subsidiaries to ensure financial strength and regulatory compliance before distributing capital to shareholders.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from MetLife\u2019s 10-K \u2014 MetLife, Inc. paid $1.6 billion in dividends annually from 2021 to 2023, but these are subject to regulatory restrictions tied to the capital and surplus of its insurance subsidiaries.",
        "Step 2: Extract from Wells Fargo\u2019s 10-K \u2014 Wells Fargo\u2019s subsidiary banks are subject to statutory dividend limits, and the Parent\u2019s ability to pay dividends is constrained by the Support Agreement if liquidity or capital metrics fall below defined thresholds.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize \u2014 Both companies face regulatory constraints on shareholder distributions, with MetLife's restrictions tied to insurance subsidiary capital and Wells Fargo's tied to banking regulations and internal capital agreements."

      "question": "How do the dividend restrictions tied to capital adequacy metrics at MetLife, Inc. and the regulatory limitations on subsidiary dividend payments at Wells Fargo & Company reflect different mechanisms through which financial holding companies are constrained in their ability to distribute capital to shareholders?",
      "answer": "MetLife, Inc. is prohibited from declaring dividends on its Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A, if it fails to meet specified capital adequacy, net income, and stockholders' equity levels. This restriction is directly tied to its financial health metrics. In contrast, Wells Fargo & Company faces regulatory limitations on the amount of dividends its subsidiary banks may pay without regulatory approval, and these restrictions can be influenced by the financial condition of the subsidiary banks and federal and state statutory provisions. Additionally, Wells Fargo\u2019s ability to pay dividends could be restricted under the Support Agreement if certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers. Therefore, while both companies are constrained in their dividend policies, MetLife\u2019s restrictions are internally tied to financial metrics, whereas Wells Fargo\u2019s are externally imposed by regulatory frameworks and contractual obligations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - MetLife, Inc. cannot declare dividends on Series A preferred stock if it fails to meet specified capital adequacy, net income, and stockholders' equity levels.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Wells Fargo\u2019s subsidiary banks are limited in the amount of dividends they may pay without regulatory approval, and the Parent\u2019s ability to pay dividends could be restricted under the Support Agreement if liquidity or capital metrics fall below defined triggers.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies face dividend restrictions, but the mechanisms differ: MetLife\u2019s are tied to internal financial metrics, while Wells Fargo\u2019s are shaped by regulatory oversight and contractual agreements."

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n\nMarket risk is the potential economic loss arising from adv erse changes in market factors. Our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis.\n\n## Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\n\nWe are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that are primarily related to changes in the functional currency v alue of receipts and payments related to foreign currency-denominated transactions. We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the v ariability in the functional currency equiv alent of anticipated non-functional currency denominated cash flows. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate mov ements.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the effect of a hypothetical 10% weakening in the v alue of the functional currencies is estimated to create an additional fair v alue loss of approximately $329 million and $236 million, respectiv ely, on our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts. T he loss from this  hypothetical  weakening would be largely offset by a corresponding gain on our cash flows from foreign currency-denominated rev enue and payments.

Resulting  translation  adjustments  are  reported  as  a  component  of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% change in the Euro against the U.S. dollar compared to the exchange rate as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 would result in a foreign currency translation adjustment of $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion, respectiv ely.\n\nWe designated our Euro-denominated senior notes as a net inv estment hedge against a portion of the foreign exchange rate exposure from our net inv estment  in  Visa  Europe.

Derivative hedges are designed to reduce risk on an economic basis while considering their impact on financial results under different accounting regimes, including GAAP and local statutory accounting. Our derivative hedge programs vary depending on the type of risk being hedged. Some hedge programs are asset or liability specific while others are portfolio hedges that reduce risk related to a group of liabilities or assets. Our use of derivatives by major hedge programs is as follows:\n\n- Risks Related to G uarantee Benefits - We use a wide range of derivative contracts to mitigate the risk associated with living guarantee benefits accounted for as MRBs. These derivatives include equity and interest rate futures, interest rate swaps, currency futures/forwards, equity indexed options, TRRs, interest rate option contracts and equity variance swaps.\n- Minimum Interest Rate Guarantees - For certain liability contracts, we provide the contractholder a guaranteed minimum interest rate. These contracts include certain fix ed annuities and other insurance liabilities. We purchase interest rate caps and floors to reduce risk associated with these liability guarantees.\n- Reinvestment Risk in Long-Duration Liability Contracts - Derivatives are used to hedge interest rate risk related to certain long-duration liability contracts. Hedges include interest rate swaps, swaptions and Treasury bond forwards.\n- Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk - We use foreign currency swaps, futures, forwards and options to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risk. These hedges are generally used to swap foreign currency denominated bonds, investments in foreign subsidiaries or equity market exposures to U.S. dollars. Our foreign subsidiaries also use these hedges to swap non-local currency assets to local currency assets in order to match liabilities .\n- General ALM Hedging Strategies - In the ordinary course of managing our asset/liability risks, we use interest rate futures, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, interest rate floors, and inflation swaps. These hedges are designed to reduce interest rate risk or inflation risk related to the ex isting assets or liabilities or related to expected future cash flows.\n- Macro Hedge Program - We use equity options, equity TRRs, interest rate swaptions, interest rate swaps and Treasury locks to mitigate the potential loss of legal entity statutory capital under stress scenarios.\n\n## Risk Measurement: Sensitivity Analysis\n\nWe measure market risk related to our market sensitive assets and liabilities based on changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity market prices utilizing a sensitivity analysis. This analysis estimates the potential changes in estimated fair value based on a hypothetical 100 basis point change (increase or decrease) in interest rates, as well as a 10% change (increase or decrease) in foreign currency exchange rates and equity market prices. We believe these changes in market rates and prices are reasonably possible in the near term. In performing the analysis summarized below, we used market rates at December 31, 2024. The sensitivity analysis separately calculates each of our market risk exposures (interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and equity market) relating to our assets and liabilities. We modeled the impact of changes (increases and decreases) in market rates and prices on the estimated fair values of our market sensitive assets and liabilities and present the results with the most adverse level of market risk impact to the Company for each of these market risk exposures as follows:\n\n- the net present values of our interest rate sensitive ex posures resulting from a 100-basis point change (increase or decrease) in interest rates;\n- estimated fair values of our foreign currency exchange rate sensitive exposures due to a 10% change (appreciation or depreciation) in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to all other currencies; and\n- the estimated fair value of our equity market sensitive ex posures due to a 10% change (increase or decrease) in equity market prices.",

      "answer": "Under a rising interest rate scenario, MET benefits over time as higher reinvestment rates on cash flows more than offset the negative impacts of higher interest crediting rates and lower income from derivative positions. MET faces reinvestment risk on approximately 6% of its invested assets annually through 2027, particularly in its long-term care business and retained asset accounts, where guaranteed renewal and minimum crediting rates limit flexibility. Meanwhile, V holds fixed-rate investments that are exposed to interest rate risk, where rising rates could decrease the fair value of these securities. However, V's strategy includes adjustable-rate securities and active portfolio management to mitigate this risk. Thus, while MET leverages rising rates to improve margins over time, V faces short-term valuation pressures but employs diversification to manage exposure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: MET experiences reinvestment risk on 6% of its invested assets annually through 2027, particularly in long-term care policies and retained asset accounts with guaranteed minimum crediting rates.",
        "Step 2: MET's rising interest rate scenario analysis indicates that higher reinvestment returns eventually outweigh the negative effects of higher crediting rates and reduced derivative income.",
        "Step 3: V's investment portfolio includes fixed-rate securities that carry interest rate risk, where rising rates could reduce fair value, indicating exposure to the same macroeconomic conditions affecting MET.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize: While MET benefits over time from rising rates due to its asset-liability structure, V faces short-term valuation risk but uses adjustable-rate instruments and active management to offset some impacts."

Long-term care policies are guaranteed renewable, and rates may be adjusted on a class basis with regulatory approval to reflect emerging experience. We review the discount rate assumptions and other assumptions associated with our long-term care claim reserves no less frequently than annually and, with respect to interest rates, set the discount rate based on the prevailing interest rate environment.\n\nOur retained asset accounts experience gross margin compression due to minimum crediting rate guarantees.  Most of these accounts are at their minimum crediting rates and therefore we use interest rate derivatives to mitigate gross margin compression.\n\nBased on our investment portfolios and cash flow estimates, approximately 6% of our invested assets each year are subject to reinvestment risk through 2027.\n\nRising Interest Rate Scenario. Higher reinvestment rates on cash flows, over time, more than offset the negative impacts of (i) higher interest crediting rates, and (ii) lower income from derivative positions designed to protect against a low interest rate environment.\n\n## Corporate &amp; Other\n\nCorporate &amp; Other contains the surplus investment portfolios used to fund capital and liquidity needs, certain reinsurance agreements, collateral financing arrangements,  and  our  outstanding  debt  and  preferred  securities.  For  purposes  of  the  two  hypothetical  interest  rate  scenarios,  the  impact  on  pension  and postretirement plan expenses is included within Corporate &amp; Other and not allocated across segments.\n\nDeclining Interest Rate Scenario. The negative impact of reinvesting in lower yielding assets, over time, more than offsets the positive impact of lower interest expense on debt, preferred stock dividends and lower pension expense. Although low interest rates result in pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities increasing, the impact is more than offset by the corresponding returns on fixed income investments and results in lower expenses.\n\nRising Interest Rate Scenario . The positive impact of reinvesting in higher yielding assets, over time, more than offsets the negative impact of higher interest expense on debt, preferred stock dividends and higher pension expense. Although higher interest rates result in pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities decreasing, the impact is more than offset by the corresponding returns on fixed income investments and results in higher expenses.\n\n## Competitive Pressures\n\nThe life insurance industry remains highly competitive. See 'Business - Competition.' Product development is focused on differentiation leading to more intense competition with respect to product features and services. Certain of the industry's products can be quite homogeneous and subject to intense price competition. Cost reduction efforts are a priority for industry players, with benefits resulting in price adjustments to favor customers and reinvestment capacity. Larger companies have the ability  to  invest  in  brand  equity,  product  development,  technology  optimization,  risk  management,  and  innovation,  which  are  among  the  fundamentals  for  sustained profitable growth in the life insurance industry. Insurers are focused on their core businesses, specifically in markets where they can achieve scale. Insurers are increasingly seeking alternative sources of revenue; there is a focus on monetization of assets, fee-based services, and opportunities to offer comprehensive solutions, which include providing value-added services along with traditional products. Financial strength and flexibility and technology modernization are prerequisites for sustainable growth in the life insurance industry. Larger market participants tend to have the capacity to invest in analytics, distribution, and information technology and have the ability to leverage the capabilities of new digital entrants. There is a shift in distribution from proprietary to third-party models in mature markets, due to the lower cost structure. Evolving customer expectations are having a significant impact on the competitive environment as insurers strive to offer the superior customer service demanded by an increasingly sophisticated industry client base. Rising demands from stakeholders to address ESG  issues have resulted in insurers expanding their sustainability efforts. Legislative and other changes affecting the regulatory environment can also affect the competitive environment within the life insurance industry and within the broader financial services industry. See 'Business - Regulation.' In addition to financial strength, technological efficiency and organizational agility, we believe that the ability to adapt  to  changes  in  the  competitive  environment  as  a  result  of  global  market  volatility,  changing  interest  rates  and  uncertain  economic  conditions  is  a  significant differentiator to success in the life insurance industry and the broader financial services industry, and we are well positioned to compete in this environment.",

If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we hav e recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could hav e a material adv erse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## ITEM 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n\nMarket risk is the potential economic loss arising from adv erse changes in market factors. Our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis.\n\n## Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\n\nWe are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that are primarily related to changes in the functional currency v alue of receipts and payments related to foreign currency-denominated transactions. We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the v ariability in the functional currency equiv alent of anticipated non-functional currency denominated cash flows. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate mov ements.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the effect of a hypothetical 10% weakening in the v alue of the functional currencies is estimated to create an additional fair v alue loss of approximately $329 million and $236 million, respectiv ely, on our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts. T he loss from this  hypothetical  weakening would be largely offset by a corresponding gain on our cash flows from foreign currency-denominated rev enue and payments.  See Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note  13-Derivative  and  Hedging  Instruments to  our  consolidated  financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.\n\nWe  are  further  exposed  to  foreign  currency  exchange  rate  risk  related  to  translation  as  the  functional  currency  of  Visa  Europe  is  the  Euro. Translation from the Euro to the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates and for rev enue  and  expense  accounts  using  an  av erage  exchange  rate  for  the  period.  Resulting  translation  adjustments  are  reported  as  a  component  of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% change in the Euro against the U.S. dollar compared to the exchange rate as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 would result in a foreign currency translation adjustment of $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion, respectiv ely.\n\nWe designated our Euro-denominated senior notes as a net inv estment hedge against a portion of the foreign exchange rate exposure from our net inv estment  in  Visa  Europe.  Foreign  currency  translation  adjustments  resulting  from  the  Euro-denominated  senior  notes  partially  offset  the  foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from our net inv estment in Visa Europe. See Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 13-Derivative and Hedging Instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.\n\nWe are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activ ities. T his risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with  clients  relativ e  to  the  timing  of  market  trades  for  balancing  currency  positions.  Risk  in  settlement  activ ities  is  limited  through  daily  operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nOur inv estment portfolio assets are held in both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate securities. Inv estments in fixed-rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. T he fair v alue of fixed-rate securities may be adv ersely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling-rate env ironment creates reinv estment risk because as",

      "question": "How does AXP's approach to recoveries in credit loss reserves contrast with PYPL's strategy through modification programs, particularly in light of AXP's $37 million partial recovery related to a corporate client bankruptcy?",
      "answer": "AXP experienced a $37 million partial recovery in 2021 related to a corporate client bankruptcy that had previously resulted in a $53 million write-off in 2020. This indicates AXP's approach to credit losses includes the potential for recoveries after write-offs, which directly impacts its provision for credit losses. In contrast, PYPL focuses on proactive modification programs, such as those implemented as part of its COVID-19 payment relief initiatives, which aim to prevent defaults and manage receivables before they reach the stage of write-offs. These differing strategies\u2014one reactive with recovery efforts after write-offs and the other preventive through modification programs\u2014show two distinct approaches to managing credit risk and receivables within the financial services sector.",

In addition, as our practice is to include uncollectible interest and/or fees as part of our total provision for credit losses, a net write-off rate including principal, interest and/or fees is also presented.\n\n(b) Net write-off rate based on principal losses only is not available due to system constraints.\n\n(c) For GCP Card Member receivables, delinquency data is tracked based on days past billing status rather than days past due. Delinquency data for periods other than 90+ days past billing is not available due to system constraints. 90+ days past billing as a % of total was 0.3% and 0.6% as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n(d) The net write-off rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes a $37 million partial recovery in Card Member receivables related to a corporate client bankruptcy, which had resulted in a $53 million write-off in the year ended December 21, 2020.\n\nRefer to Note 3 for additional indicators, including external environmental qualitative factors, management considers in its evaluation process for reserves for credit losses.\n\n## IMPAIRED LOANS AND RECEIVABLES\n\nImpaired loans and receivables are individual larger balance or homogeneous pools of smaller balance loans and receivables for which it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the customer agreement. We consider impaired loans and receivables to include (i) loans over 90 days past due still accruing interest, (ii) nonaccrual loans and (iii) loans and receivables modified as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs).\n\nIn instances where the customer is experiencing financial difficulty, we may modify, through various financial relief programs, loans and receivables with the intention to minimize losses and improve collectability, while providing customers with temporary or permanent financial relief. We have classified loans and receivables in these modification programs as TDRs and continue to classify customer accounts that have exited a modification program as a TDR, with such accounts identified as 'Out of Program TDRs.'\n\nSuch modifications to the loans and receivables primarily include (i) temporary interest rate reductions (possibly as low as zero percent, in which case the loan is characterized as non-accrual in our TDR disclosures), (ii) placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not to exceed 60 months and (iii) suspending delinquency fees until the customer exits the modification program. Upon entering the modification program, the customer's ability to make future purchases is either limited, canceled, or in certain cases suspended until the customer successfully exits from the modification program. In accordance with the modification agreement with the customer, loans and/or receivables may revert back to the original contractual terms (including the contractual interest rate where applicable) when the customer exits the modification program, which is (i) when all payments have been made in accordance with the modification agreement or (ii) when the customer defaults out of the modification program.\n\nReserves for modifications deemed TDRs are measured individually and incorporate a discounted cash flow model. All changes in the impairment measurement are included within provisions for credit losses.",

Our failure to comply with such laws could result in potentially significant regulatory and/or governmental investigations and/or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions, ongoing regulatory monitoring, customer attrition, decreases in the use or acceptance of our cards and damage to our reputation and our brand. In recent years, there has been increasing regulatory enforcement and litigation activity in the areas of privacy, data protection and information and cyber security in the United States, the EU and various other countries in which we operate.\n\nFor more information on regulatory and legislative activity in this area, see 'Privacy, Data Protection, Data Governance, Information and Cyber Security' under 'Supervision and Regulation.'\n\n## We may not be able to effectively manage the operational and compliance risks to which we are exposed.\n\nWe consider operational risk to be the risk of loss due to, among other things, inadequate or failed processes, people or information systems, or impacts from the external environment (e.g., natural disasters). Operational risk includes, among others, the risk that error or misconduct could result in a material financial misstatement, a failure to monitor a third party's compliance with regulatory or legal requirements, or a failure to adequately monitor and control access to, or use of, data in our systems we grant to third parties. As processes or organizations are changed, or new products and services are introduced, such as new lending features, debit products and checking accounts, we may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes. Through human error, fraud or malfeasance, conduct risk can result in harm to customers, legal liability, fines, sanctions, customer remediation and brand damage.\n\nCompliance risk arises from violations of, or failure to conform or comply with, laws, rules, regulations, internal policies and procedures, and ethical standards. We need to continually update and enhance our control environment to address operational and compliance risks. Operational and compliance failures, deficiencies in our control environment or an inability to maintain an ethical workplace and high standards of business conduct can expose us to reputational and legal risks as well as fines, civil money penalties or payment of damages and can lead to diminished business opportunities and diminished ability to expand key operations.\n\n## If we are not able to protect our intellectual property, or successfully defend against any infringement or misappropriation assertions brought against us, our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected.\n\nWe rely on a variety of measures to protect our intellectual property and control access to, and distribution of, our trade secrets and other proprietary information. These measures may not prevent infringement of our intellectual property rights or misappropriation of our proprietary information and a resulting loss of competitive advantage. The ability to enforce intellectual property rights to prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information may be limited in certain jurisdictions. In addition, competitors or other third parties may allege that our products, systems, processes or technologies infringe on their intellectual property rights. Given the complex, rapidly changing and competitive technological and business environments in which we operate, and the potential risks and uncertainties of intellectual property-related litigation, a future assertion of an infringement or misappropriation claim against us could cause us to lose significant revenues, incur significant defense, license, royalty or technology development expenses, and/or pay significant monetary damages.\n\n## Tax legislative initiatives or assessments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. The laws and regulations related to tax matters are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although management believes our positions are reasonable, we are subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service in the United States and by tax authorities in all the jurisdictions in which we conduct business operations. We are being challenged in a number of countries regarding our application of valueadded taxes (VAT) to certain transactions. While we believe we comply with all applicable VAT and other tax laws, rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, the tax authorities may determine that we owe additional taxes or apply existing laws and regulations more broadly, which could result in a significant increase in liabilities for taxes and interest in excess of accrued liabilities.\n\nNew tax legislative initiatives, including increases in the corporate tax rate, are currently being considered and may be enacted. In addition, new guidelines issued by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) could have an impact on how multinational enterprises are taxed on their global profits. These potential changes could adversely impact our effective tax rate, our tax positions and tax liabilities. In addition, actions by tax authorities, including an increase in tax audit activity, could have an adverse impact on our tax liabilities.",

(a wholly-owned subsidiary) holds licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in the states  where  such  licenses  are  required,  as  well  as  in  the  District  of  Columbia  and  certain  territories.  If  we  violate  the  laws  or regulations covered under our licenses, we could be subject to liability and/or additional restrictions, forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states or territories, forced to change our business practices, or required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals, which could impose substantial costs and harm our business.\n\nWhile  we  currently  allow  our  customers  to  send  payments  from  approximately  200  markets,  we  allow  customers  in  only approximately half of those markets (including the U.S.) to also receive payments, in some cases with significant restrictions on the manner in which customers can hold balances or withdraw funds. These limitations may adversely affect our ability to grow our business.\n\nWe principally  provide  our  services  to  customers  in  the  European  Economic Area  ('EEA')  and  the  United  Kingdom  ('U.K.') through  PayPal  (Europe),  our  wholly-owned  subsidiary  that  is  licensed  and  subject  to  regulation  as  a  credit  institution  in Luxembourg.  PayPal  (Europe)  is  potentially  subject  to  significant  fines  or  other  enforcement  action  if  it  violates  applicable requirements. Additionally, compliance with applicable laws and regulations could become more costly and operationally difficult to  manage due to potentially inconsistent  interpretations  and  domestic  regulations  by  various  countries  in  the  region.  European regulation,  such  as  the  Revised  Payment  Services  Directive  ('PSD2')  enabling  payment  and  account  information  sharing  by regulated payment providers, could subject us to data security and other legal and financial risks. If the business activities of PayPal (Europe)  exceed  certain  thresholds,  or  if  the  European  Central  Bank  ('ECB')  determines,  PayPal  (Europe)  may  be  deemed  a significant supervised entity and certain activity of PayPal (Europe) would become directly supervised by the ECB, rather than by the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier, which could subject us to additional requirements and would likely increase compliance costs.\n\nIn  many of the other markets outside the U.S. in which we do business, we serve our customers through PayPal Pte. Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary based in Singapore. PayPal Pte. Ltd. is supervised by the Monetary Authority of Singapore ('MAS'), but does  not  hold  a  remittance  license. As  a  result,  PayPal  Pte.  Ltd.  is  not  able  to  offer  outbound  remittance  payments  to  PayPal customers from Singapore. In many of the markets (other than Singapore) served by PayPal Pte. Ltd., it is unclear and uncertain whether our Singapore-based service is subject only to Singapore law or, if it is subject to the application of local laws, whether such  local  laws  would  require  a  payment  processor  like  us  to  be  licensed  as  a  payments  service,  bank,  financial  institution,  or otherwise. The Payment Services Act came into effect in Singapore in January 2020. PayPal Pte. Ltd. has submitted an application for a Major Payment Institution license to the MAS to continue to provide payments services, and is operating under an exemption from  holding  a  license  within  a  statutory  transition  period  while  the  application  is  pending.  Once  PayPal  Pte.  Ltd.  obtains  its license, we will be required to comply with new regulatory requirements, which will result in increased operational complexity and costs for our Singapore and international operations.\n\nIn addition, in certain markets outside of the U.S., we provide our services to customers through PayPal Pte. Ltd. or, if required by local regulations, a local branch of PayPal Pte. Ltd. or a local subsidiary subject to local regulatory supervision or oversight. From time to time, we may also acquire entities subject to local payments regulatory supervision or oversight.\n\nThere  are  substantial  costs  and  potential  product  and  operational  changes  involved  in  maintaining  and  renewing  licenses, certifications, and approvals, and we could be subject to fines, other enforcement actions, and litigation if we are found to violate any of these requirements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to (or decide to) continue to apply for or obtain any licenses,  renewals,  certifications,  and  approvals  in  any  jurisdictions.  In  certain  markets,  we  may  rely  on  local  banks  or  other partners to process payments and conduct foreign currency exchange transactions in local currency, and local regulators may use their authority over such local partners to prohibit, restrict, or limit us from doing business. The need to obtain or maintain licenses, certifications,  or  other  regulatory  approvals  could  impose  substantial  additional  costs,  delay  or  preclude  planned  transactions, product launches or improvements, require significant and costly operational changes, impose restrictions, limitations, or additional requirements on our business, products and services, or prevent us from providing our products or services in a given market.\n\n## Cryptocurrency Regulation\n\nOur  current  and  planned  cryptocurrency  offerings  could  subject  us  to  additional  regulations,  licensing  requirements,  or  other obligations. The rapidly evolving regulatory landscape with respect to cryptocurrency may subject us to inquiries or investigations from regulators and governmental authorities, require us to make product changes, restrict or discontinue product offerings, and implement additional and potentially costly controls.

To manage this risk, we seek to maintain access to a diverse set of cash, readilymarketable securities and contingent sources of liquidity, such that we can continuously meet our business requirements and expected future financing obligations for at least a twelve-month period under a variety of adverse circumstances. These include, but are not limited to, an event where we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. We consider the trade-offs between maintaining too much liquidity, which can be costly and limit financial flex ibility, and having inadequate liquidity, which may result in financial distress during a liquidity event.\n\nFunding and liquidity risk is managed at an aggregate consolidated level as well as at certain subsidiaries in order to ensure that sufficient and accessible liquidity resources are maintained. The Funding and Liquidity Committee reviews forecasts of our aggregate and subsidiary cash positions and financing requirements, approves funding plans designed to satisfy those requirements under normal and stressed conditions, establishes guidelines to identify the amount of liquidity resources required and monitors positions and determines any actions to be taken.\n\nOur liquidity risk management processes are designed in alignment with regulatory guidelines. As a Category III firm under U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies' rules, we are subject to heightened capital, liquidity and prudential requirements, including more stringent liquidity risk management requirements. See 'Supervision and Regulation - Capital and Liquidity Regulation' under 'Business' for more information.\n\n## MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS\n\nWe define model risk as the risk of adverse consequences, such as financial loss, poor business and strategic decision making, damage to our reputation or customer harm, from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and outcomes.\n\nThe Enterprise-Wide Model Risk Policy establishes the comprehensive framework for governing model risk. This policy is approved by the ERMC. The comprehensive risk management and governance framework includes procedures for model development, independent model validation, model risk reporting and change management capabilities that seek to minimize erroneous model methodology, outputs, and misuse. We also assess model performance and model- related issues on an ongoing basis and seek to address deficiencies in a timely manner. In addition, we utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) models, including Generative AI tools, for a variety of business use cases. We perform extensive reviews and testing to reduce the risk that these AI/ML techniques result in adverse consequences.\n\n## STRATEGIC AND BUSINESS RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS\n\nWe define strategic and business risk as the risk related to our inability to achieve our business objectives due to poor strategic decisions, including decisions related to the launch or modification of products, mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures, poor implementation of strategic decisions or declining demand for our products and services.\n\nStrategic decisions are reviewed and approved by business leaders and various committees and must be aligned with company policies. We seek to manage strategic and business risks through risk controls embedded in these processes as well as overall risk management oversight over business goals. Launch of key new products as well as existing product performance is reviewed periodically by committees and business leaders to inform business decisions as appropriate. Mergers, acquisitions and divestitures can only be approved following Executive Committee due diligence, a comprehensive risk assessment by operational, market, credit and oversight leaders provided to the Chief Risk Officer and approval by either the Chief Risk Officer or appropriate risk committees. All new and material changes to products and services are reviewed and approved by the New Products Committee and appropriate credit or risk committees.",

Our governance framework provides for oversight of methods, models, qualitative adjustments, process controls and results. At least quarterly, representatives from the Finance and Risk Management organizations review and assess our allowance methodologies, key assumptions and the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses. G roups independent of our estimation functions participate in the review and validation process. Tasks performed by these groups include periodic review of the rationale for and quantification of inputs requiring judgment as well as adjustments to results.\n\nWe have model policies, established by an independent Model Risk Office, which govern the validation of models and related supporting documentation to ensure the appropriate use of models for estimating credit losses. The Model Risk Office validates all models and requires ongoing monitoring of their performance.\n\nIn addition to the allowance for credit losses, on a quarterly basis, we review and assess our estimate of expected losses related to unfunded lending commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable which are generally in our Commercial Banking business. The factors impacting our assessment generally align with those considered in our evaluation of the allowance for credit losses for the Commercial Banking business. The reserve for losses on unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and changes to it are recorded through the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income.\n\nAlthough we examine a variety of externally available data, as well as our internal loan performance data, to determine our allowance for credit losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments, our estimation process is subject to risks and uncertainties, including a reliance on historical loss and trend information that may not be representative of current conditions and indicative of future performance as well as economic forecasts that may not align with actual future economic conditions. Accordingly, our actual credit loss experience may not be in line with our expectations. We provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for credit losses for each of our loan portfolio segments in 'Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.' We provide information on the components of our allowance, disaggregated by operating segment, and changes in our allowance in 'Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 5-Allowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments.'\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date.\n\nGoodwill totaled $15.1 billion as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023. We did not recognize any goodwill impairment in 2024 or 2023. See 'Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 7-G oodwill and Other Intangible Assets' for additional information.\n\nWe perform our goodwill impairment test annually on October 1 at a reporting unit level. We are also required to test goodwill for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate it is more-likely-than-not that an impairment may have occurred. An impairment of a reporting unit's goodwill is determined based on the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. We have four reporting units: Credit Card, Auto Finance, Other Consumer Banking, and Commercial Banking.\n\nFor the purpose of our goodwill impairment testing, we calculate the carrying amount of a reporting unit using an allocated capital approach based on each reporting unit's specific regulatory capital requirements and underlying risks. The carrying amount for a reporting unit is the sum of its respective capital requirements, goodwill and other intangibles balances. Consolidated stockholder's equity in excess of the sum of all reporting units capital requirements that is not identified for future capital needs, such as dividends, share buybacks, or other strategic initiatives, is allocated to the reporting units and the Other category and assumed to be distributed to equity holders in future periods.\n\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit is a subjective process that requires the use of estimates and the exercise of significant judgment. We calculate the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow ('DCF') calculation, a\n\n79\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)",

      "answer": "The regulatory compliance costs associated with AML requirements at Capital One (COF), such as the need to implement risk-based compliance programs, adhere to new FinCEN rules, and manage increased penalties, increase operational costs and reduce revenue. Simultaneously, American Express (AXP) notes that regulatory developments could limit its ability to pursue business opportunities or conduct business in certain jurisdictions. Together, these factors illustrate that high market entry barriers in the financial services sector\u2014driven by complex and evolving regulatory frameworks\u2014make it more difficult and costly for firms to expand or innovate, thereby reinforcing the sector's high entry barriers.",

'\n\nFor further discussion of our cybersecurity risk management, see 'Item 1C. Cybersecurity.'\n\n## Anti-Money Laundering, Combating the Financing of Terrorism and Economic Sanctions\n\nThe Bank Secrecy Act ('BSA'), as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 ('Patriot Act'), and its implementing regulations require financial institutions to, among other things, implement a risk-based compliance program reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and to combat the financing of terrorism, including through suspicious activity and currency transaction reporting, the implementation of policies, procedures, and internal controls, record-keeping and customer due diligence.\n\nThe Patriot Act provides enhanced information collection tools and enforcement mechanisms to the U.S. government and expanded certain requirements for financial institutions, including due diligence and record-keeping requirements for private banking and correspondent accounts; standards for verifying customer identification at account opening; rules to produce certain records upon request of a regulator or law enforcement agency; and rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement agencies in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism, money laundering and other crimes.\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 ('AML Act'), enacted as part of the National Defense Authorization Act, requires the U.S. Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ('FinCEN') to issue a number of rules that will update and expand the BSA's regulatory requirements. For example, the AML Act requires FinCEN to issue National Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism Priorities (the 'National Priorities'), which the agency did in June 2021, and to conduct studies and issue regulations that may alter some of the due diligence, record-keeping and reporting requirements that the BSA and Patriot Act impose on banks. FinCEN has yet to issue a final rule that establishes the compliance obligations of financial institutions with respect to the National Priorities, and several other mandatory rule makings under the AML Act remain outstanding. The AML Act also promotes increased information-sharing and use of technology and increases penalties for violations of the BSA and includes whistleblower incentives, both of which could increase the prospect of regulatory enforcement.\n\nWe are also required to comply with sanctions laws and regulations administered and imposed by the United States government, including the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control ('OFAC') and the Department of State, as well as comparable sanctions programs imposed by foreign governments and multilateral bodies. Sanctions can be either comprehensive or selective and use the blocking of assets and trade restrictions to accomplish foreign policy and national security goals.\n\n## Derivatives Activities\n\nTitle VII of the Dodd-Frank Act establishes a regulatory framework for the governance of the over-the-counter ('OTC') derivatives market, including swaps and security-based swaps and requires the registration of certain market participants as swap dealers or security-based swap dealers. The Bank is registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ('CFTC') as a swap dealer. Registration as a swap dealer subjects the Bank to additional regulatory requirements with respect to its swaps and other derivatives activities. As a result of the Bank's swap dealer registration, it is subject to the rules of the OCC concerning capital and margin requirements for swap dealers, including the mandatory exchange of variation margin and initial margin with certain counterparties. Additionally, as a registered swap dealer, the Bank is subject to requirements under the CFTC's regulatory regime, including rules regarding business conduct standards, recordkeeping obligations, regulatory reporting and procedures relating to swaps trading. The Bank's swaps and other derivatives activities do not require it to register with the SEC as a security-based swap dealer.\n\n## Broker-Dealer Activities\n\nCertain of our non-bank subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by various federal and state authorities. Capital One Securities, Inc., KippsDeSanto &amp; Company and TripleTree, LLC are registered broker-dealers regulated by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ('FINRA').

For ex ample, we and other U.S. financial services providers have been the target of attacks, such as denial of service attacks, social engineering and the impersonation of current or prospective employees and contractors. We develop and maintain systems and processes aimed at detecting and preventing information security and cybersecurity incidents and fraudulent activity, including our cyber crisis response procedures, which require significant investment, maintenance and ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and regulatory requirements change, new vulnerabilities and exploits are discovered and as efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated.\n\nDespite our efforts and the efforts of third parties that process, transmit or store our data and data of our customers and colleagues or support our operations, such as service providers, merchants and regulators, the possibility of information, operational and cybersecurity incidents, malicious social engineering, password mismanagement, corporate espionage, fraudulent or other malicious activities and human error or malfeasance cannot be eliminated entirely and will evolve as new and emerging technology is deployed by threat actors, including the use of artificial intelligence and quantum computing, and we increasingly use platforms that are outside of our network and control environments. For example, we are aware that certain of our third-party service providers and joint ventures have been the victims of ransomware and other cyberattacks, in some instances that affected our data or services provided to us. In addition, recently introduced products and services, such as checking accounts and non-card lending, may lead to an increase in the number or types of cyberattacks and our exposure to fraud and other malfeasance. Risks associated with such incidents and activities include theft of funds and other monetary loss, disruption of our operations and the unauthorized disclosure, release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, modification, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary, trade secret or other information (including account data information). An incident may not be detected until well after it occurs and the severity and potential impact may not be fully known for a substantial period of time after it has been discovered. We are subject to varied cybersecurity regulations and incident reporting requirements, which could require us to disclose incidents that may not have been resolved or fully investigated at the time of disclosure, leading to customer confusion, regulatory scrutiny and negative publicity and exacerbating risks related to the incident itself. Our ability to address incidents may also depend on the timing and nature of assistance that may be provided from relevant governmental or law enforcement agencies.\n\nInformation, operational or cybersecurity incidents, fraudulent activity and other actual or perceived failures to maintain confidentiality, integrity, availability of services and data, privacy and/or security has led to increased regulatory scrutiny and may lead to regulatory investigations and intervention (such as mandatory card reissuance), consent decrees, increased litigation (including class action litigation), response costs (including notification and remediation costs), fines, negative assessments of us and our subsidiaries by banking regulators and rating agencies, reputational and financial damage to our brand, negative impacts to our partner relationships, and reduced usage of our products and services, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business. The disclosure of sensitive company information could also undermine our competitive advantage and divert management attention and resources.\n\nSuccessful cyberattacks, data breaches, disruptions or other incidents related to the actual or perceived failures to maintain confidentiality, integrity, availability of services and data, privacy and/or security at other large financial institutions, large retailers, travel and hospitality companies, government agencies or other market participants, whether or not we are impacted, could lead to a general loss of customer confidence that could negatively affect us, including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or harming the reputation of the financial system in general, which could result in reduced use of our products and services. Such events could also result in legislation and additional regulatory requirements. Although we maintain cyber insurance, there can be no assurance that liabilities or losses we may incur will be covered under such policies or that the amount of insurance will be adequate.\n\n## The uninterrupted operation of our information systems is critical to our success and a significant disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\nWe rely extensively on our information technology systems and those of our third parties, including our transaction authorization, clearing and settlement systems, and data centers, which have experienced and may continue to experience service disruptions or degradation that may result from technology malfunction, sudden increases in processing or other volumes, natural disasters and weather events, fires, accidents, technology change management issues, power outages, internet outages, telecommunications failures, fraud, denial-of-service, ransomware and other cyberattacks, inadequate infrastructure in lesser-developed markets, technology capacity management issues, terrorism, computer viruses, vulnerabilities or failures in hardware or software, physical or electronic break-ins, or similar events. Due to the interconnectivity and complexity of information systems and their reliance on common systems, software and vendors, disruptions or degradations have had, and will likely continue to have, wide-reaching consequences, including the potential to disrupt the overall financial system and other key systems in the global economy. Service disruptions or degradations impacting us or our partners can prevent access to online services and account information, compromise or limit access to company or customer data, impede or prevent transaction processing, communications to customers and financial reporting, disrupt ordinary business operations, result in contractual penalties or obligations, trigger regulatory reporting obligations, and lead to regulatory investigations and fines, increased regulatory oversight, and litigation (including class action litigation). Any such service disruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of the reliability of our products and services and materially adversely affect our overall business, reputation and results of operations.\n\n## Our business is subject to evolving and comprehensive government regulation and supervision, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe face significantly heightened regulatory expectations and scrutiny in the U.S. and globally, which significantly affects our business and requires continual enhancement of our compliance efforts.

      "question": "How does the increase in American Express's reliance on cobrand partner relationships for 25% of its billed business contrast with Capital One's financial exposure to its rewards program, given Capital One's $9.0 billion customer rewards expense in 2024?",
      "answer": "American Express relies heavily on cobrand partner relationships, which account for 25% of its worldwide billed business in 2024, making it vulnerable to renegotiations or terminations that could significantly impact revenue. In contrast, Capital One incurs a direct financial liability through its rewards program, with a $9.0 billion customer rewards expense in 2024, reflecting a different type of financial exposure\u2014one tied to accrued customer liabilities rather than partner dependency. This highlights two distinct risk profiles centered around rewards programs: AXP faces operational and strategic risk tied to third-party relationships, while COF bears accrual and liability risk tied to customer redemptions.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nMany of our competitors are subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes, and some may have lower cost structures and more agile business models and systems. More restrictive laws and regulations that do not apply to all of our competitors can put us at a disadvantage, including prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions, regulating our business practices or adversely affecting our cost structure.\n\n## We face intense competition for partner relationships, which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n\nIn the ordinary course of our business we enter into different types of contractual arrangements with business partners in a variety of industries. For example, we work with partners such as Delta, Hilton, Marriott and British Airways to offer cobranded cards for consumers and small businesses, and with partners in many industries, including Delta, to offer benefits and rewards to Card Members. See 'Partners and Relationships' under 'Business' for additional information on our business partnerships, including with Delta.\n\nCompetition for relationships with key business partners is very intense and there can be no assurance we will be able to grow or maintain these partner relationships or that they will remain as profitable or valued by our customers. Establishing and retaining attractive cobrand card partnerships is particularly competitive among card issuers and networks as these partnerships typically appeal to high-spending loyal customers. All of our cobrand portfolios in the aggregate accounted for approximately 25 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended December 31, 2024. Card Member loans related to our cobrand portfolios accounted for approximately 36 percent of our worldwide Card Member loans as of December 31, 2024.\n\nCobrand arrangements are entered into for a fixed period, generally ranging from five to ten years, and will terminate in accordance with their terms, including at the end of the fix ed period unless ex tended or renewed at the option of the parties, or upon early termination as a result of an event of default or otherwise. We face the risk that we could lose partner relationships, even after we have invested significant resources in the relationships. Additionally, partners may make changes to the products and services they offer or otherwise become less desirable to our customers, which may lower the value of our products, such as the cobranded cards we issue to our customers. We may also choose not to renew certain cobrand relationships. Billed business could decline and Card Member attrition could increase, in each case, significantly as a result of the termination of one or more cobrand partnership relationships. In addition, some of our cobrand arrangements provide that, upon expiration or termination, the cobrand partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the loans generated with respect to such cobranded card portfolio, which could result in the loss of the card accounts and a significant decline in our Card Member loans outstanding.\n\nWe regularly seek to extend or renew cobrand arrangements in advance of the end of the contract term and face the risk that existing relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us or that we may be unable to renegotiate on terms that are acceptable to us, as competition for such relationships continues to increase. We make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. The amount we pay to our cobrand partners has increased, particularly in the United States, and may continue to increase as arrangements are renegotiated due to increasingly intense competition for cobrand partners among card issuers and networks.\n\nThe loss of exclusivity arrangements with business partners, the loss of the partner relationship altogether (whether by non-renewal at the end of the contract period, such as the end of our relationship with Costco in the United States in 2016, or as the result of a merger, legal or regulatory action or otherwise) or the renegotiation of existing partnerships with terms that are significantly worse for us could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. See ' Our business is subject to evolving and comprehensive government regulation and supervision, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition ' above for information on the uncertainty regarding our cobrand and agent relationships in the EU. In addition, any publicity associated with the loss of any of our key business partners could harm our reputation, making it more difficult to attract and retain Card Members and merchants, and could weaken our negotiating position with our remaining and prospective business partners.\n\n## Arrangements with our business partners represent a significant portion of our business. We are exposed to risks associated with our business partners, including reputational issues, business slowdowns, bankruptcies, liquidations, restructurings, consolidations and outages, and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners.\n\nOur success is, in many ways, dependent on the success of our partners. From customer acquisition to cobranding arrangements, from participation in our rewards programs to facilitating B2B supplier payments for our corporate clients, we rely on our business partners across many aspects of our company and our arrangements with business partners represent a significant portion of our business. For example, our two largest redemption partners are Amazon and Delta. Some of our partners manage certain aspects of our customer relationships, such as our OptBlue partners. To the extent any of our partners fail to effectively promote and support our products, experience a slowdown in their business, operational disruptions, reputational issues or loss of consumer confidence, or are otherwise unable to meet our expectations or those of their other stakeholders, our business may be materially negatively impacted. For example, the operational rights relating to our prepaid reloadable and gift card business are owned by a business partner and the reloadable operations have experienced disruptions and compliance issues that impacted the ability of our prepaid customers to load and use their cards. If such operations are interrupted, suspended, terminated or otherwise experience further issues in the future, it could further negatively impact our customers' ex perience, result in additional costs, litigation and regulatory action, and harm our business and reputation. We also face the risk that ex isting relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us or that we may be unable to renegotiate on terms that are acceptable to us. In addition, we may be obligated to make or accelerate payments to certain business partners such as cobrand partners upon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as a shortfall in certain performance and revenue levels. If we are not able to effectively manage these triggering events, we could unexpectedly have to make payments to these partners, which could have a negative effect on our",

      "answer": "AXP funds its rewards program primarily through its 'spend-centric' business model, which generates revenues by driving card spending, particularly through cobrand partnerships like the Delta Air Lines arrangement that accounts for 12% of billed business. This model allows AXP to invest in rewards and benefits because spending on its cards generates fee revenue and discount revenue from merchants. In contrast, COF directly recognizes customer rewards expense of $9.0 billion in 2024, indicating a cost-based model where the company accrues and manages a rewards liability that is sensitive to redemption rates and costs. COF maintains a customer rewards reserve of $8.2 billion as of December 31, 2024, showing that it funds rewards through direct expense provisions rather than through merchant fees like AXP.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Partners and Relationships\n\nOur integrated payments platform allows us to work with a range of business partners, and our partners in return help drive the scale and relevance of the platform.\n\nThere are many examples of how we work with partners, including: issuing cards under cobrand arrangements with other corporations and institutions (e.g., Delta Air Lines (Delta), Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Marriott International and British Airways); providing greater value to our Card Members (e.g., Amex Offers and statement credits for purchases with partners); offering innovative ways for our Card Members to earn and use points with our merchants (e.g., Pay with Points at Amazon.com); expanding merchant acceptance with third-party acquirers and processors (e.g., OptBlue partners); operating through joint ventures in certain jurisdictions (e.g., in China, the Middle East and Switzerland); developing new capabilities and features with our digital partners (e.g., PayPal and i2c); enhancing our travel benefits and services (e.g., Fine Hotels and Resorts ); and providing experiences and entertainment for Card Members (e.g., via Formula 1 and AEG Worldwide). We also have an ownership position in, and commercial arrangements with, Global Business Travel Group, Inc. (GBTG), which provides business travelrelated services. \u00ae\n\nDelta is our largest strategic partner. Our relationships with, and revenues and ex penses related to, Delta are significant and represent an important source of value for our Card Members. We issue cards under cobrand arrangements with Delta and the Delta cobrand portfolio continued to represent approximately 12 percent of worldwide billed business and approximately 21 percent of worldwide Card Member loans as of December 31, 2024. The Delta cobrand portfolio generates fee revenue and interest income from Card Members and discount revenue from Delta and other merchants for spending on Delta cobrand cards. The current Delta cobrand agreement runs through the end of 2029 and we expect to continue to make significant investments in this partnership. Among other things, Delta is also a key participant in our Membership Rewards program, provides travel-related benefits and services, including airport lounge access for certain American Express Card Members, accepts American Express cards as a merchant and is a corporate payments customer.\n\nWorking with all of our partners, we seek to provide value, choice and unique experiences across our customer base.\n\n## Our Spend-Centric Model and Revenue Mix\n\nOur 'spend-centric' business model focuses on generating revenues primarily by driving spending on our cards and secondarily through finance charges and fees. Spending on our cards, which is higher on average on a per-card basis versus our network competitors, offers superior value to merchants in the form of loyal customers and larger transactions, and attracts partners to provide value to our Card Members and merchants. Because of the revenues generated from having highspending Card Members and the annual card fees we charge on many of our products, we are able to invest in attractive rewards and other benefits for Card Members, as well as targeted marketing and other programs and investments for merchants. This creates incentives for Card Members to spend more on their cards and positively differentiates American Express cards.\n\nWe believe our spend-centric model gives us the ability to provide differentiated value to Card Members, merchants and business partners.\n\n## The American Express Brand and Service Excellence\n\nOur brand and its attributes-trust, security and service-are key assets. We invest heavily in managing, marketing, promoting and protecting our brand, including through the delivery of our products and services in a manner consistent with our brand promise. The American Express brand is ranked among the most valuable brands in the world. We place significant importance on trademarks, service marks and patents, and seek to secure our intellectual property rights around the world.\n\nWe aim to provide the world's best customer experience every day and our reputation for world-class service has been recognized by numerous awards over the years. Our customer care professionals, travel consultants and partners treat servicing interactions as an opportunity to bring the brand to life for our customers, add meaningful value and deepen relationships.",

Additional control requirements apply to algorithmic trading, high frequency trading and direct electronic access. Commodities trading firms are  required  to  calculate  their  positions  and  adhere  to  specific  position limits.

A  number  of  these  requirements,  particularly  those  regarding recordkeeping and reporting, also apply to transactions that do not involve a  registered  swap  dealer.

The  CFTC  has  rules  establishing  capital  requirements  for swap  dealers  that  are  not  subject  to  the  capital  rules  of  a  prudential regulator,  such  as  the  FRB.  The  CFTC  also  has  financial  reporting requirements  for  covered  swap  entities  and  capital  rules  for  CFTCregistered  futures  commission  merchants  that  provide  explicit  capital requirements for proprietary positions in swaps and security-based swaps that  are  not  cleared  by  a  clearing  organization.  Certain  of  our  registered swap  dealers,  including J.  Aron,  are  subject  to  the  CFTC's  capital requirements.\n\nOur  affiliates  registered  as  swap  dealers  are  subject  to  the  margin  rules issued by the  CFTC (in the case of our non-bank swap dealers) and the FRB (in the case of GS Bank USA and GSBE). Inter-affiliate transactions under  the  CFTC  and  FRB  margin  rules  are  generally  exempt  from  initial margin requirements.\n\nOur affiliates registered as swap  dealers are also subject  to  NFA regulation, including requirements pertaining to cybersecurity and supervision,  and  the  NFA  examines  them  for  compliance  with  these requirements as well as compliance with CFTC rules.",

The financial services industry is also becoming more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial products and services, including electronic and internet-based financial solutions such as electronic securities trading, lending and payment solutions, as well as digital currencies and alternative payment methods. These technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties.\n\n## REGULATION AND SUPERVISION\n\nThe U.S. financial services industry is subject to significant regulation and regulatory oversight initiativ es. This regulation and oversight may continue to impact how U.S. financial services companies conduct business and may continue to result in increased regulatory compliance costs.\n\nBanking statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review by Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies, as well as non-U.S. governments and financial regulators, and a change in them, including changes in how they are interpreted or implemented, could have a material effect on our business. The regulatory framework applicable to depository institutions and bank holding companies (BHCs) is intended to protect depositors, the federal deposit insurance fund, consumers and the banking system as a whole, and not necessarily investors in BHCs such as the Company.\n\nStatutes, regulations, and policies could restrict our ability to div ersify  into other areas of financial services, make acquisitions, and pay dividends or repurchase our capital stock. They may also require us to provide financial support to one or more of our subsidiary banks, maintain capital in excess of amounts desired by management, and pay higher deposit insurance premiums as a result of assessments or a general deterioration in the financial condition of depository institutions.\n\nThe following describes the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to us and the more significant regulations and regulatory oversight initiativ es that hav e affected or may  affect our business. For additional information about the regulatory matters discussed below and other regulations and regulatory oversight matters, see the 'Overview,' 'Capital M anagement,' 'Forward-Looking Statements' and 'Risk Factors' sections and Note 26 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) to Financial Statements in the 2024 A nnual Report to Shareholders.\n\n## General\n\nParent Bank Holding Company. As a BHC, the Parent is subject to regulation under the BHC Act and to inspection, examination and supervision by its primary regulator, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board or FRB). The Parent is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities A ct of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, both as administered by the SEC. As a company with securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the Parent is subject to the rules of the NY SE for listed companies.\n\nSubsidiary Banks. Our subsidiary national banks, and their subsidiaries, are subject to regulation and examination primarily by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and also by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the FRB, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The non-\n\nU.S. branches, subsidiaries, and offices of our subsidiary national banks are subject to regulation and examination by their respective financial regulators as well as by the OCC and the FRB. Non-U.S. operations of our national bank subsidiaries may be subject to the laws and regulations of the countries in which they conduct business.\n\nNonbank Subsidiaries. Many of our nonbank subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the FRB and other applicable federal and state agencies. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by applicable state insurance regulatory agencies, as well as the FRB. Our brokerage subsidiaries are regulated by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA ) and, in some cases, the CFTC and the M unicipal Securities Rulemaking Board, and state securities regulators. Our other nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to the laws and regulations of the federal government and/or the various states as well as non-U.S. countries in which they conduct business or operate.\n\n## Parent Bank Holding Company Activities\n\n'Financial in Nature' Requirement. We became a financial holding company (FHC) effective M arch 13, 2000. We continue to maintain our status as a BHC for purposes of various FRB regulations. A s a BHC that has elected to be treated as an FHC pursuant to the BHC Act, we may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature. 'Financial in nature' activ ities include securities underwriting, dealing, and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; merchant banking; and activities that the FRB, in consultation with the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activ ity . 'Complementary activ ities' are activ ities that the FRB determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a safety and soundness risk. Financial in nature activities and incidental or complementary activities are collectively referred to below as 'financial activ ities'.\n\nFRB approval is generally not required for us to acquire a company (other than a BHC, bank or savings association) engaged in financial activities, as determined by the FRB. Prior notice to the FRB may be required, however, if the company to be acquired has total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. Prior FRB approval is required before we may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a BHC, bank or savings association. We are also subject to prohibitions on our ability to merge, acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or acquire control of another company if our total resulting consolidated liabilities would exceed 10% of the aggregate consolidated liabilities of all financial companies.\n\nBecause we are an FHC, if any of our applicable subsidiary banks receives a rating under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, as amended (CRA), of less than satisfactory, we will be prohibited, until the rating is raised to satisfactory or better, from engaging in certain new financial activ ities or acquiring certain companies engaged in financial activities. CRA  performance is also considered by regulators in reviewing applications to establish bank branches. In addition, if the FRB finds that an FHC or any one of its subsidiary banks is not well capitalized or well managed, the FHC would be required to enter into an agreement with the FRB to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements and which may contain additional limitations or conditions. Until corrected, the FHC could be prohibited from engaging in any new financial activity or",

Goldman Sachs, as a larger covered entity, must comply by December 2025, while Wells Fargo must meet the same compliance deadline since it is also classified as a large financial institution.

          "chunk_text": "## Privacy and Cybersecurity Regulation\n\nOur  businesses  are  subject  to  numerous  laws  and  regulations  relating  to the privacy of information regarding clients, employees and others. These include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  the  GLB   Act,  the  California  Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (CCPA), the E.U.'s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the U.K.'s Data Protection Act 2018 and U.K. GDPR, the Swiss Federal Data Protection  Act,  the  Japanese  Personal  Information  Protection  Act,  the Personal  Information  Protection  Law  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China, the  Australian Privacy  Act 1988, and India's Digital Personal  Data Protection Act. Generally, privacy laws impose obligations with regard to the  collection,  use  and  disclosure  of  personal  information  and  require public disclosure of privacy practices. Some privacy laws offer individuals certain  rights  about  how  their  personal  information  is  processed,  provide for significant penalties for non-compliance, and, under certain circumstances, impose requirements for transfers of personal data across national borders.\n\nIn 2023, the SEC proposed to amend Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity  (SCI).  The  proposed  amendments  to  Regulation  SCI  would, among other things, expand the types of entities covered by the regulation, require  additional  policies  and  procedures  to  address  cybersecurity  risks, and  require  disclosure  of  additional  types  of  cybersecurity  events  to  the SEC.\n\nIn 2024, the SEC amended Regulation S-P that implements the GLB Act. The  amendments  to  Regulation  S-P  require  broker-dealers,  investment companies  and  investment  advisers  registered  with  the  SEC  to  adopt written policies and procedures for incident response programs to address unauthorized  access  to  or  use  of  customer  information.  The  amended Regulation S-P requires covered entities to notify within 30 days individuals affected by an incident involving sensitive customer information  and  provide  them  with  details  about  the  incident  and  other information  intended  to  help  affected  individuals  respond  appropriately. Larger covered entities, such as GS&amp;Co., will have until December 2025, and smaller covered entities will have until June 2026, to comply with the amended  Regulation  S-P.  In  2024,  the  California  Privacy  Protection Agency  proposed  regulations  under  the  CCPA  relating  to  cybersecurity audits, risk assessments, and automated decision-making technology.\n\nOur  businesses are also subject to laws and regulations  governing cybersecurity and related risks, and which require regulatory disclosures, and, in some instances, individual disclosures, of certain security incidents. These include, but are not limited to, the NYDFS Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies. The NYDFS  also requires financial institutions regulated by the NYDFS, including GS Bank USA,  to,  among  other  things,  (i)  establish  and  maintain  a  cybersecurity program designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of their information systems; (ii) implement and maintain a written cybersecurity policy setting forth policies and procedures for the protection  of  their  information  systems  and  nonpublic  information;  and (iii)  designate a  Chief  Information  Security  Officer.  In 2023, the  NYDFS adopted  amendments  to  its  cybersecurity  regulations  that  will  impose heightened or additional requirements with respect to cybersecurity incident  notifications,  risk  management  and  governance.  Most  of  these amendments became effective in 2024 although certain amendments have a longer transition period and become effective in 2025.\n\nIn  2023,  the  E.U.  Digital  Operational  Resilience  Act  (DORA)  became effective  and  applies  from  January  2025.  DORA  requires  E.U.  financial entities, such as GSBE, to have a comprehensive governance and control framework  for  the  management  of  information  and  communications technology  risk.  In  addition,  in  2024,  the  E.U. Artificial  Intelligence  Act (E.U.  AI  Act)  became  effective.  Certain  provisions  of  the  E.U.  AI  Act apply from February 2025, with other provisions applying between August 2025 and August 2027. The E.U. AI Act establishes rules for placing on the market, putting into service, and using artificial intelligence systems in the E.U.\n\nIn 2024, the CFPB adopted a rule regarding personal financial data rights that  requires  financial  institutions  that  offer  consumer  deposit  accounts and  issue  credit  cards,  such  as  GS  B ank  USA,  to  provide  consumers electronic  access  to  at  least  24  months  of  transaction  data  and  certain account information and are prohibited from imposing any fees or charges for  maintaining  or  providing  access  to  such  data.  The  rule  also  imposes data accuracy, retention and other obligations, and data use limitations and other  obligations  on  entities  obtaining  access  to  such  personal  financial data, such as GS&amp;Co. The current compliance deadline for large financial institutions,  including  GS  B ank  USA,  is  April  1,  2026.  However,  this timeline  is  potentially  subject  to  change  as  a  result  of  CFPB   action  or currently pending litigation.\n\nSee  'Management's  Discussion  and Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and Results of Operations  -  Risk Management  -  Cybersecurity Risk Management' in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for further information about our cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance.",

          "chunk_text": "## Fiscal and Monetary Policies\n\nOur business and earnings are affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies. We are particularly affected by the monetary policies of the FRB, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. A mong the instruments of monetary policy available to the FRB are (a) conducting open market operations in United States government securities, (b) changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions, (c) imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions' deposits, and (d) imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates. These methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. The policies of the FRB may have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Privacy Provisions and the Sharing of Personal F inancial Data\n\nFederal banking regulators, as required under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB Act), have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. The rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. The privacy provisions of the GLB A ct affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors. The Fair Credit Reporting A ct imposes requirements regarding sharing certain information about consumers among affiliated companies. Under these requirements, consumers have the option to opt out from affiliated companies sharing certain information among the affiliates, depending on the information and purpose of sharing.\n\nPersonal Financial Data Rights. In October 2024, the CFPB issued a rule pursuant to section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank A ct that requires financial service providers to make consumers' data available upon request to consumers and authorized third parties. The compliance date for the rule is A pril 1, 2026. The rule will require the Company to update its technology systems, compliance, third-party risk management programs, and digital channels. Given the rule's requirement to share customer information with authorized third parties, some of whom could be non-financial institutions, the rule could result in increased fraud, data misuse, and competition.\n\n## Regulation of Consumer F inancial Products\n\nConsumer financial products are subject to numerous and, in many cases, highly complex federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations, as well as enhanced regulatory scrutiny and expectations. In particular, the CFPB implements and enforces regulations designed to ensure that consumers receive timely, clear, and accurate disclosures regarding financial products and are protected from unfair, deceptive or abusive practices. The CFPB has issued and proposed a number of rules impacting consumer financial products, including rules impacting residential mortgage lending, credit cards, and other financial products and banking related activities, as well as the fees that may be charged for certain banking products and services. In addition to these rulemaking activities, the CFPB may conduct ongoing supervisory examination activities of the financial services industry with respect to a number of consumer businesses and products, including mortgage lending and servicing, fair lending requirements, and auto finance.\n\n## Regulation of Swaps and Other Derivatives Activities\n\nThe CFTC and the SEC have adopted comprehensive sets of rules regulating swaps and security-based swaps, respectively, and the OCC and other federal regulatory agencies have adopted margin requirements for uncleared swaps and security-based swaps. As a registered swap dealer and a conditionally-registered security-based swap dealer, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., is subject to these rules.\n\n## Regulatory Developments Related to Climate Change and Sustainability\n\nFederal, state, and non-U.S. governments and government agencies have demonstrated increased attention to the impacts and potential risks associated with climate change and sustainability-related activities. For example, federal banking regulators are reviewing the implications of climate change on the financial stability of the United States and have issued guidance on the identification and management by large banks of climaterelated financial risks. In addition, the SEC adopted final rules, which have been voluntarily stayed pending legal proceedings, requiring public companies to disclose certain climate-related information, including climaterelated risks and impacts, certain greenhouse gas emissions, climaterelated targets and goals, and governance of climate-related risks and relevant risk management processes. Similarly, California finalized climaterelated disclosure laws, while multiple other states have proposed or adopted laws and guidance with requirements for, or restrictions on, sustainability-related initiativ es or disclosures. A dditionally , the European Union finalized its Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) requiring companies to assess climate risks, opportunities, and impacts as well as disclose certain climate-related information, and also finalized its Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) requiring companies to adopt and implement a transition plan for climate change mitigation. The approaches taken by various governments and government agencies can vary significantly, evolve over time, and sometimes conflict. A ny current or future rules, regulations, and guidance related to climate change and its impacts could require us to change certain of our business practices or strategies, reduce our revenue and earnings, impose additional costs on us, subject us to legal or regulatory proceedings, or otherwise adversely affect our business operations and/or competitive position.\n\n## Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002\n\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) implemented a broad range of corporate governance and accounting measures designed to increase corporate responsibility, provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies, and protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of disclosures under federal securities laws. We are subject to Sarbanes-Oxley because we are required to file periodic reports with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Among other things, Sarbanes-Oxley and/or its implementing regulations established membership requirements and additional responsibilities for our audit committee, imposed restrictions on the relationship between us and our outside auditors (including restrictions on the types of non-audit services our auditors may provide to us), imposed additional responsibilities for our external financial statements on our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, ex panded the disclosure requirements for our corporate insiders, required our management to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting, and",

      "answer": "GS's non-bank swap dealers, including J.

Meanwhile, WFC's subsidiary national banks fall under the regulatory oversight of the CFTC, which may impose similar compliance obligations on WFC\u2019s swap-related activities.

As  a  market  maker  on exchanges, we are required to maintain orderly markets in the securities to which we are assigned.\n\n## Swaps, Derivatives and Commodities Regulation\n\nThe  commodity  futures,  commodity  options  and  swaps  industry  in  the U.S.  is  subject  to  regulation  under  the  U.S.  Commodity  Exchange  Act (CEA). The CFTC  is the U.S. federal agency charged with the administration of the CEA. In addition, the SEC is the U.S. federal agency charged  with  the  regulation  of  security-based  swaps.  The  rules  and regulations  of  various  self-regulatory  organizations,  such  as  the  Chicago Mercantile  Exchange,  other  futures  exchanges  and  the  National  Futures Association  (NFA),  also  govern  commodity  futures,  commodity  options and swaps activities.\n\nThe terms 'swaps' and 'security-based swaps' include a wide variety of derivative  instruments  in  addition  to  those  conventionally  referred  to  as swaps (including  certain  forward  contracts  and  options),  and  relate  to  a wide  variety  of  underlying  assets  or  obligations,  including  currencies, commodities,  interest  or  other  monetary  rates,  yields,  indices,  securities, credit events, loans and other financial obligations.\n\nCFTC rules require registration  of  swap  dealers,  mandatory  clearing  and execution  of  interest  rate  and  credit  default  swaps  and  real-time  public reporting  and  adherence  to  business  conduct  standards  for  all  in-scope swaps.  A  number  of  these  requirements,  particularly  those  regarding recordkeeping and reporting, also apply to transactions that do not involve a  registered  swap  dealer.  GS&amp;Co.  and  other  subsidiaries,  including  GS Bank  USA,  GSBE,  GSI  and  J.  Aron,  are  registered  with  the  CFTC  as swap  dealers.  The  CFTC  has  rules  establishing  capital  requirements  for swap  dealers  that  are  not  subject  to  the  capital  rules  of  a  prudential regulator,  such  as  the  FRB.  The  CFTC  also  has  financial  reporting requirements  for  covered  swap  entities  and  capital  rules  for  CFTCregistered  futures  commission  merchants  that  provide  explicit  capital requirements for proprietary positions in swaps and security-based swaps that  are  not  cleared  by  a  clearing  organization.  Certain  of  our  registered swap  dealers,  including J.  Aron,  are  subject  to  the  CFTC's  capital requirements.\n\nOur  affiliates  registered  as  swap  dealers  are  subject  to  the  margin  rules issued by the  CFTC (in the case of our non-bank swap dealers) and the FRB (in the case of GS Bank USA and GSBE). Inter-affiliate transactions under  the  CFTC  and  FRB  margin  rules  are  generally  exempt  from  initial margin requirements.\n\nOur affiliates registered as swap  dealers are also subject  to  NFA regulation, including requirements pertaining to cybersecurity and supervision,  and  the  NFA  examines  them  for  compliance  with  these requirements as well as compliance with CFTC rules.",

These technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties.\n\n## REGULATION AND SUPERVISION\n\nThe U.S. financial services industry is subject to significant regulation and regulatory oversight initiativ es. This regulation and oversight may continue to impact how U.S. financial services companies conduct business and may continue to result in increased regulatory compliance costs.\n\nBanking statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review by Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies, as well as non-U.S. governments and financial regulators, and a change in them, including changes in how they are interpreted or implemented, could have a material effect on our business.

They may also require us to provide financial support to one or more of our subsidiary banks, maintain capital in excess of amounts desired by management, and pay higher deposit insurance premiums as a result of assessments or a general deterioration in the financial condition of depository institutions.\n\nThe following describes the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to us and the more significant regulations and regulatory oversight initiativ es that hav e affected or may  affect our business. For additional information about the regulatory matters discussed below and other regulations and regulatory oversight matters, see the 'Overview,' 'Capital M anagement,' 'Forward-Looking Statements' and 'Risk Factors' sections and Note 26 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) to Financial Statements in the 2024 A nnual Report to Shareholders.\n\n## General\n\nParent Bank Holding Company. As a BHC, the Parent is subject to regulation under the BHC Act and to inspection, examination and supervision by its primary regulator, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board or FRB). The Parent is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities A ct of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, both as administered by the SEC. As a company with securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the Parent is subject to the rules of the NY SE for listed companies.\n\nSubsidiary Banks. Our subsidiary national banks, and their subsidiaries, are subject to regulation and examination primarily by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and also by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the FRB, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The non-\n\nU.S. branches, subsidiaries, and offices of our subsidiary national banks are subject to regulation and examination by their respective financial regulators as well as by the OCC and the FRB. Non-U.S. operations of our national bank subsidiaries may be subject to the laws and regulations of the countries in which they conduct business.\n\nNonbank Subsidiaries. Many of our nonbank subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the FRB and other applicable federal and state agencies. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by applicable state insurance regulatory agencies, as well as the FRB. Our brokerage subsidiaries are regulated by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA ) and, in some cases, the CFTC and the M unicipal Securities Rulemaking Board, and state securities regulators. Our other nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to the laws and regulations of the federal government and/or the various states as well as non-U.S. countries in which they conduct business or operate.\n\n## Parent Bank Holding Company Activities\n\n'Financial in Nature' Requirement. We became a financial holding company (FHC) effective M arch 13, 2000. We continue to maintain our status as a BHC for purposes of various FRB regulations. A s a BHC that has elected to be treated as an FHC pursuant to the BHC Act, we may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature. 'Financial in nature' activ ities include securities underwriting, dealing, and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; merchant banking; and activities that the FRB, in consultation with the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activ ity . 'Complementary activ ities' are activ ities that the FRB determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a safety and soundness risk. Financial in nature activities and incidental or complementary activities are collectively referred to below as 'financial activ ities'.\n\nFRB approval is generally not required for us to acquire a company (other than a BHC, bank or savings association) engaged in financial activities, as determined by the FRB. Prior notice to the FRB may be required, however, if the company to be acquired has total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. Prior FRB approval is required before we may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a BHC, bank or savings association. We are also subject to prohibitions on our ability to merge, acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or acquire control of another company if our total resulting consolidated liabilities would exceed 10% of the aggregate consolidated liabilities of all financial companies.\n\nBecause we are an FHC, if any of our applicable subsidiary banks receives a rating under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, as amended (CRA), of less than satisfactory, we will be prohibited, until the rating is raised to satisfactory or better, from engaging in certain new financial activ ities or acquiring certain companies engaged in financial activities. CRA  performance is also considered by regulators in reviewing applications to establish bank branches. In addition, if the FRB finds that an FHC or any one of its subsidiary banks is not well capitalized or well managed, the FHC would be required to enter into an agreement with the FRB to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements and which may contain additional limitations or conditions.

      "question": "How does the FRB's authority to impose corrective capital requirements on GS and WFC create different financial constraints, particularly considering GS's Volcker Rule limitation of 3% of Tier 1 capital for aggregate investments in covered funds and WFC's prohibition from engaging in new financial activities if not well capitalized?",
      "answer": "The FRB's authority to impose corrective capital requirements affects GS and WFC differently due to their distinct regulatory constraints. For GS, under the Volcker Rule, the firm is limited to investing no more than 3% of its Tier 1 capital in all covered funds combined. This creates a direct financial constraint on GS's ability to sponsor and invest in private equity, hedge funds, and other covered fund structures, tying such investment capacity to its Tier 1 capital base. If GS fails to meet capital requirements, the FRB could impose additional corrective capital measures, further limiting its ability to deploy capital in these areas. For WFC, the FRB may restrict its ability to engage in new financial activities if it or any of its subsidiary banks fail to maintain a well-capitalized or well-managed status. This creates a different kind of constraint, where WFC could face limitations on strategic expansion or diversification into new financial services, even if capital is otherwise available. Therefore, while both firms are subject to FRB oversight and corrective capital requirements, GS faces specific investment limitations tied to its Tier 1 capital, whereas WFC faces operational constraints on activity expansion based on its capital and management status.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - GS is limited to 3% of Tier 1 capital for aggregate investments in covered funds under the Volcker Rule.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both GS and WFC are subject to FRB authority to impose corrective capital requirements, but the financial implications differ: GS faces investment constraints tied to Tier 1 capital, while WFC faces restrictions on new financial activities based on capital and management status."

          "chunk_text": "Prompt Corrective Action. The U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) requires the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies to take 'prompt corrective action' in respect of depository  institutions  that  do  not  meet  specified  capital  requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital  categories  for  FDIC-insured  banks,  such as GS Bank USA: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.\n\nAn  institution  may  be  downgraded  to,  or  deemed  to  be  in,  a  capital category  that  is  lower  than  is  indicated  by  its  capital  ratios  if  it  is determined  to  be  in  an  unsafe  or  unsound  condition  or  if  it  receives  an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management  and  capital  distributions, as the capital  category  of  an institution  declines.  Failure  to  meet  the  capital  requirements  could  also require a depository institution to raise capital. Ultimately, critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator, as described in 'Insolvency of an IDI or a BHC' above.\n\nThe prompt corrective action regulations do not apply to BHCs. However, the  FRB  is  authorized  to  take  appropriate  action  at  the  BHC  level,  based upon  the  undercapitalized status of the BHC's  depository  institution subsidiaries. In certain instances, relating to an undercapitalized depository institution subsidiary, the BHC  would  be  required to guarantee the performance  of  the  undercapitalized  subsidiary's  capital  restoration  plan and  might  be  liable  for  civil  money  damages  for  failure  to  fulfill  its commitments  on that guarantee. Furthermore, in the event of the bankruptcy of the BHC, the guarantee would take priority over the BHC's general unsecured creditors, as described in 'Source of Strength' above.\n\nVolcker Rule and Other Restrictions on Activities. As a BHC, we are subject to limitations on the types of business activities in which we may engage.\n\nVolcker  Rule. The  V olcker  Rule  prohibits  'proprietary  trading,'  but permits activities such as underwriting, market making and risk-mitigation hedging, requires an extensive compliance program and includes additional reporting and record-keeping requirements.\n\nIn addition, the V olcker Rule limits the sponsorship of, and investment in, 'covered funds' (as defined in the rule) by banking entities, including us. It  also  limits  certain  types  of  transactions  between us and our sponsored and  advised  funds,  similar  to  the  limitations  on  transactions  between depository  institutions  and  their  affiliates.  Covered  funds  include  our private equity funds, certain of our credit and real estate funds, our hedge funds and certain other investment structures. The limitation on investments in covered funds requires us to limit our investment in each such  fund  to  3%  or  less  of  the  fund's  net  asset  value,  and  to  limit  our aggregate investment in all such funds to 3% or less of our Tier 1 capital.\n\nOther  Restrictions. FHCs  generally  can  engage  in  a  broader  range  of financial and related activities than are otherwise permissible for BHCs as long  as  they  continue  to  meet  the  eligibility  requirements  for  FHCs.  The broader  range  of  permissible  activities  for  FHCs  includes  underwriting, dealing and making markets in securities and making investments in nonFHCs (merchant banking  activities).  In  addition,  certain  FHCs,  including us,  are  permitted  to  engage  in  certain  commodities  activities  in  the  U.S. that may otherwise be impermissible for BHCs, so long as the assets held pursuant to these activities do not equal 5% or more of their consolidated assets.\n\nThe FRB, however, has the authority to limit an FHC's ability to conduct activities that would otherwise be permissible, and will likely do so if the FHC  does  not  satisfactorily  meet  certain  requirements  of  the  FRB .  For example,  if  an  FHC  or  any  of  its  U.S.  depository  institution  subsidiaries ceases to maintain its status as well-capitalized or well-managed, the FRB may impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements, as well as additional  limitations  or  conditions.  If  the  deficiencies  persist,  the  FHC may be required to divest its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries or to cease engaging in activities other than the business of banking and certain closely related activities.\n\nIn  addition,  we  are  required  to  obtain  prior  FRB   approval  before  certain acquisitions  and  before  engaging  in  certain  banking  and  other  financial activities both within and outside the U.S.\n\nU.S.  G-SIBs,  like  us,  are  also  required  to  comply  with  a  rule  regarding single counterparty credit limits, which imposes more stringent requirements for credit exposures to major financial institutions.\n\nThe New Y ork State banking law imposes lending limits (which take into account credit exposure from derivative transactions) and other requirements that have in the past impacted and could in the future impact the manner and scope of GS Bank USA's activities.",

          "chunk_text": "significantly change the competitive environment in which we conduct business. The financial services industry is also becoming more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial products and services, including electronic and internet-based financial solutions such as electronic securities trading, lending and payment solutions, as well as digital currencies and alternative payment methods. These technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties.\n\n## REGULATION AND SUPERVISION\n\nThe U.S. financial services industry is subject to significant regulation and regulatory oversight initiativ es. This regulation and oversight may continue to impact how U.S. financial services companies conduct business and may continue to result in increased regulatory compliance costs.\n\nBanking statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review by Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies, as well as non-U.S. governments and financial regulators, and a change in them, including changes in how they are interpreted or implemented, could have a material effect on our business. The regulatory framework applicable to depository institutions and bank holding companies (BHCs) is intended to protect depositors, the federal deposit insurance fund, consumers and the banking system as a whole, and not necessarily investors in BHCs such as the Company.\n\nStatutes, regulations, and policies could restrict our ability to div ersify  into other areas of financial services, make acquisitions, and pay dividends or repurchase our capital stock. They may also require us to provide financial support to one or more of our subsidiary banks, maintain capital in excess of amounts desired by management, and pay higher deposit insurance premiums as a result of assessments or a general deterioration in the financial condition of depository institutions.\n\nThe following describes the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to us and the more significant regulations and regulatory oversight initiativ es that hav e affected or may  affect our business. For additional information about the regulatory matters discussed below and other regulations and regulatory oversight matters, see the 'Overview,' 'Capital M anagement,' 'Forward-Looking Statements' and 'Risk Factors' sections and Note 26 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) to Financial Statements in the 2024 A nnual Report to Shareholders.\n\n## General\n\nParent Bank Holding Company. As a BHC, the Parent is subject to regulation under the BHC Act and to inspection, examination and supervision by its primary regulator, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board or FRB). The Parent is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities A ct of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, both as administered by the SEC. As a company with securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the Parent is subject to the rules of the NY SE for listed companies.\n\nSubsidiary Banks. Our subsidiary national banks, and their subsidiaries, are subject to regulation and examination primarily by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and also by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the FRB, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The non-\n\nU.S. branches, subsidiaries, and offices of our subsidiary national banks are subject to regulation and examination by their respective financial regulators as well as by the OCC and the FRB. Non-U.S. operations of our national bank subsidiaries may be subject to the laws and regulations of the countries in which they conduct business.\n\nNonbank Subsidiaries. Many of our nonbank subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the FRB and other applicable federal and state agencies. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by applicable state insurance regulatory agencies, as well as the FRB. Our brokerage subsidiaries are regulated by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA ) and, in some cases, the CFTC and the M unicipal Securities Rulemaking Board, and state securities regulators. Our other nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to the laws and regulations of the federal government and/or the various states as well as non-U.S. countries in which they conduct business or operate.\n\n## Parent Bank Holding Company Activities\n\n'Financial in Nature' Requirement. We became a financial holding company (FHC) effective M arch 13, 2000. We continue to maintain our status as a BHC for purposes of various FRB regulations. A s a BHC that has elected to be treated as an FHC pursuant to the BHC Act, we may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature. 'Financial in nature' activ ities include securities underwriting, dealing, and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; merchant banking; and activities that the FRB, in consultation with the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activ ity . 'Complementary activ ities' are activ ities that the FRB determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a safety and soundness risk. Financial in nature activities and incidental or complementary activities are collectively referred to below as 'financial activ ities'.\n\nFRB approval is generally not required for us to acquire a company (other than a BHC, bank or savings association) engaged in financial activities, as determined by the FRB. Prior notice to the FRB may be required, however, if the company to be acquired has total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. Prior FRB approval is required before we may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a BHC, bank or savings association. We are also subject to prohibitions on our ability to merge, acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or acquire control of another company if our total resulting consolidated liabilities would exceed 10% of the aggregate consolidated liabilities of all financial companies.\n\nBecause we are an FHC, if any of our applicable subsidiary banks receives a rating under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, as amended (CRA), of less than satisfactory, we will be prohibited, until the rating is raised to satisfactory or better, from engaging in certain new financial activ ities or acquiring certain companies engaged in financial activities. CRA  performance is also considered by regulators in reviewing applications to establish bank branches. In addition, if the FRB finds that an FHC or any one of its subsidiary banks is not well capitalized or well managed, the FHC would be required to enter into an agreement with the FRB to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements and which may contain additional limitations or conditions. Until corrected, the FHC could be prohibited from engaging in any new financial activity or",

      "question": "How does the adoption and application of the Portfolio Layer Method (PLM) differ between JPMorgan Chase and Charles Schwab in their 2023 financial reporting, particularly in terms of portfolio hedging structure and basis adjustment allocation?",
      "answer": "JPMorgan Chase adopted the Portfolio Layer Method (PLM) in 2023, allowing them to hedge a broader portfolio of fixed-rate assets and maintain basis adjustments at the portfolio level, only allocating them to individual assets under specific circumstances such as breaches of hedged layer amounts or voluntary de-designation. In contrast, Charles Schwab applies PLM to hedge interest rate risk on both prepayable and non-prepayable financial assets by designating a stated amount of a closed portfolio as the hedged layer. Schwab must terminate the PLM hedge relationship if the hedged layers exceed the portfolio amount, and any basis adjustments related to a breach are immediately recognized in interest revenue, unlike JPMorgan\u2019s ongoing portfolio-level maintenance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - JPMorgan Chase adopted PLM in 2023, allowing broader hedging of fixed-rate assets and maintaining basis adjustments at the portfolio level, only allocating under specific events.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Charles Schwab applies PLM to hedge interest rate risk on a closed portfolio of financial assets, with hedged layers that may include multiple layers, and must terminate hedging if the portfolio amount falls below the hedged layer.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both firms apply PLM for interest rate hedging, but differ in portfolio structure (JPM: broader fixed-rate assets; Schwab: closed portfolio with prepayable assets), hedging breach response (JPM: allocation only under specific events; Schwab: immediate recognition of breach-related basis adjustments), and termination triggers (JPM: voluntary or breach; Schwab: breach or anticipated breach)."

      "question": "How does the use of Funds Transfer Pricing (FTP) methodology impact the allocation of net interest income to business segments at JPMorgan Chase, and how does this compare to The Charles Schwab Corporation's use of FTP for allocating revenues?",
      "answer": "At JPMorgan Chase, the FTP methodology is used to allocate interest income and expense to Lines of Business (LOBs) and Other Corporate, transferring primary interest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO. The methodology considers the risk characteristics of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet products, and has led to higher cost of funds for loans due to the higher interest rate environment in 2023, which impacted business segments' net interest income. In contrast, Schwab uses an FTP methodology to allocate certain revenues as part of its segment reporting, alongside an activity-based costing model for expense allocation. While JPM adjusts FTP assumptions periodically based on economic conditions, Schwab integrates FTP into its broader segment performance evaluation on a pre-tax basis without using segment assets and liabilities for resource allocation decisions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - JPM's use of FTP methodology allocates interest income/expense to LOBs and transfers interest rate risk to Treasury and CIO, with 2023 interest rate increases raising loan funding costs and affecting net interest income.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Schwab uses FTP methodology to allocate certain revenues in its segment reporting, alongside activity-based costing for expense allocation, and evaluates segment performance on a pre-tax basis without using segment assets/liabilities.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both JPM and Schwab use FTP to allocate financial results across business segments, but JPM emphasizes risk transfer to centralized units and adjusts methodology with economic conditions, while Schwab integrates FTP into a broader performance evaluation framework without asset/liability-based resource allocation."

      "question": "How does the adoption and application of the Portfolio Layer Method (PLM) of hedge accounting differ between JPMorgan Chase and Charles Schwab in their 2023 financial reporting, particularly in terms of asset transfers and accounting treatment?",
      "answer": "JPMorgan Chase adopted the Portfolio Layer Method (PLM) of hedge accounting effective January 1, 2023, and transferred U.S. state and municipal obligations with a carrying value of $7.1 billion from HTM to AFS, recognizing $38 million in net pre-tax unrealized losses in AOCI. In contrast, Charles Schwab disclosed its use of PLM for hedging interest rate risk on prepayable and non-prepayable financial assets by designating a stated amount of a closed portfolio as a hedged layer. Schwab also indicated that basis adjustments under PLM are maintained at the portfolio level and only allocated to individual assets upon termination of the hedging relationship, except in cases of breach, where the affected portion is immediately recognized in interest revenue. These differences highlight distinct implementation approaches to the same accounting policy.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From JPM's 10-K, identify the specific adoption of the PLM hedge accounting guidance effective January 1, 2023, and the resulting transfer of $7.1 billion in HTM securities to AFS with a $38 million unrealized loss impact on AOCI.",
        "Step 2: From Schwab's 10-K, extract the details on how PLM is applied to hedge interest rate risk by designating hedged layers within a closed portfolio, and how basis adjustments are handled upon termination or breach.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the differences in implementation: JPM focused on the transfer of specific securities and immediate AOCI impact, while Schwab emphasized portfolio-level basis adjustments and termination rules."

      "answer": "JPMorgan Chase noted that if access to stable and lower-cost funding sources like FHLB borrowings were reduced, it may need to rely on more expensive or limited alternative funding, which could negatively affect its funding costs. Meanwhile, Charles Schwab actively utilized FHLB borrowings as a supplemental funding source in 2023 and reduced its outstanding balance by approximately 18% from peak levels by year-end. This indicates that both firms rely on FHLB borrowings for liquidity, but Schwab\u2019s proactive reduction suggests a strategic shift toward managing balance sheet size and improving its Tier 1 Leverage Ratio to 8.5%, while JPMorgan expressed concern over potential liquidity constraints if such funding were limited.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - JPMorgan Chase identified FHLB borrowings as a key lower-cost funding source and warned that reduced access could force reliance on more expensive alternatives.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both firms rely on FHLB borrowings for liquidity, but Schwab actively managed its borrowings downward, while JPMorgan expressed risk around potential liquidity constraints."

Specifically, simulated decreases of 50, 100, and 200 basis points would have reduced net interest revenue by 1.7%, 3.8%, and 8.3%, respectively, due in part to the increased allocation to FHLB borrowings.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## U.S. Covered Litigation\n\n## Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) - Putative Class Actions\n\nBeginning in May 2005, a series of complaints (the majority of which were styled as class actions) were filed in U.S. federal district courts by merchants against Visa U.S.A., Visa International and/or Mastercard, and in some cases, certain U.S. financial institutions. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued an order transferring the cases to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Court) for coordination of pre-trial proceedings in MDL 1720. A group of purported class plaintiffs subsequently filed amended and supplemental class complaints. The individual and class complaints generally challenged, among other things, Visa's and Mastercard's purported setting of interchange reimbursement fees, their 'no surcharge' and honor-all-cards rules, alleged tying and bundling of transaction fees, and Visa's  reorganization  and  IPO,  under  the  federal  antitrust  laws  and,  in  some  cases,  certain  state  unfair  competition laws. The complaints sought money damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, attorneys' fees and, in one instance, an order that the IPO be unwound.\n\nVisa Inc., Visa U.S.A., Visa International, Mastercard Incorporated, Mastercard International Incorporated, various U.S.  financial  institution  defendants,  and  the  class  plaintiffs  signed  a  settlement  agreement  (2012  Settlement Agreement) to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims. Pursuant to the 2012 Settlement Agreement, the Company deposited approximately  $4.0  billion  from  the  U.S.  litigation  escrow  account  and  approximately  $500  million  attributable  to interchange  reductions  for  an  eight-month  period  into  court-authorized  settlement  accounts.  Visa  subsequently received  from  the  Court  and  deposited  into  the  Company's  U.S.  litigation  escrow  account  'takedown  payments'  of approximately  $1.1  billion.  On  June  30,  2016,  the  U.S.  Court  of Appeals  for  the  Second  Circuit  vacated  the  lower court's certification of the merchant class, reversed the approval of the settlement, and remanded the case to the lower court for further proceedings.\n\nOn remand, the district court entered an order appointing interim counsel for two putative classes of plaintiffs, a 'Damages Class' and an 'Injunctive Relief Class.' The plaintiffs purporting to act on behalf of the putative Damages Class  subsequently  filed  a  Third  Consolidated  Amended  Class  Action  Complaint,  seeking  money  damages  and attorneys' fees, among other relief. A new group of purported class plaintiffs, acting on behalf of the putative Injunctive Relief  Class,  filed  a  class  action  complaint  against  Visa,  Mastercard,  and  certain  bank  defendants  seeking,  among other things, an injunction against the setting of default interchange rates; against certain Visa operating rules relating to  merchants,  including  the  honor-all-cards  rule;  and  against  various  transaction  fees,  including  the  fixed  acquirer network fee, as well as attorneys' fees.",

      "answer": "MET leverages strong relationships with regional banks in Japan as a core part of its bancassurance strategy, which is critical to its distribution model. In contrast, V highlights that government mandates, such as Argentina's requirement for local banks to use domestic real-time payment (RTP) systems, pose a disintermediation risk by limiting international payment networks like Visa from participating in domestic transactions. This creates a contrast: MET benefits from local bank partnerships in a traditional financial ecosystem, while V faces potential exclusion from markets where local banks are required to use alternative, government-backed payment systems.",

They may offer more effective, innovative or a wider range of programs, products and services. They may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies that result in broader brand recognition,  and  greater  use,  including  with  respect  to  issuance  and  merchant  acceptance. They  may  also  develop better  security  solutions  or  more  favorable  pricing  arrangements.  Moreover,  even  if  we  successfully  adapt  to technological change and the proliferation of alternative types of payment services by developing and offering our own services in these areas, such services may provide less favorable financial terms for us than we currently receive from VisaNet transactions, which could hurt our financial results and prospects.\n\nCertain of our competitors operate with different business models, have different cost structures or participate in different  market  segments.  Those  business  models  may  ultimately  prove  more  successful  or  more  adaptable  to regulatory, technological and other developments. In some cases, these competitors have the support of government mandates that prohibit,  limit  or  otherwise  hinder  our  ability  to  compete  for  transactions  within  certain  countries  and regions. Some of our competitors, including American Express, Discover, private-label card networks, virtual currency providers, technology companies that enable the exchange of digital assets, and certain alternative payments systems like Alipay and WeChat Pay, operate closed-loop payments systems, with direct connections to both merchants and consumers. Government actions or initiatives such as the Dodd-Frank Act, the IFR in Europe, or RTP initiatives by governments such as the U.S. Federal Reserve's FedNow or the Central Bank of Brazil's  Pix  system  may  provide competitors  with  increased  opportunities  to  derive  competitive  advantages  from  these  business  models,  and  may create new competitors, including in some cases the government itself. Similarly, regulation in Europe under PSD2 and the IFR may require us to open up access to, and allow participation in, our network to additional participants, and reduce the infrastructure investment and regulatory burden on competitors. We also run the risk of disintermediation due  to  factors  such  as  emerging  technologies  and  platforms,  including  mobile  payments,  alternative  payment credentials,  other  ledger  technologies  or  payment  forms,  and  by  virtue  of  increasing  bilateral  agreements  between entities that prefer not to use our payments network for processing transactions. For example, merchants could process transactions directly with issuers, or processors could process transactions directly with issuers and acquirers.\n\nWe expect the competitive landscape to continue to shift and evolve. For example:\n\n- we,  along  with  our  competitors,  clients,  network  participants,  and  others  are  developing  or  participating  in alternative payments systems or products, such as mobile payment services, ecommerce payment services, P2P payment services, real-time and faster payment initiatives, and payment services that permit ACH or direct debits from or to consumer checking accounts, that could either reduce our role or otherwise disintermediate us from the transaction processing or the value added services we provide to support such processing. Examples include  initiatives  from  The  Clearing  House,  an  association  consisting  of  large  financial  institutions  that  has developed  its  own  faster  payments  system;  Early  Warning  Services,  which  operates  Zelle,  a  bank-offered alternative network that provides another platform for faster funds or real-time payments across a variety of payment  types,  including P2P, corporate and  government  disbursement,  bill  pay  and  deposit  check transactions; and cryptocurrency or stablecoin-based payments initiatives.\n- many countries or regions are developing or promoting domestic networks, switches and RTP systems (e.g., U.S.,  India  and  Europe). To  the  extent  these  governments  mandate  local  banks  and  merchants  to  use  and accept these systems for domestic or other transactions, prohibit international payments networks, like Visa, from  participating  on  those  systems,  and/or  impose  restrictions  or  prohibitions,  on  international  payments networks from offering payment services on such transactions, we could face the risk of our business being disintermediated in those countries. For example, in Argentina, the government has mandated local acquirers to use debit card credentials to initiate payment transactions on a government-sponsored national RTP system. Furthermore,  in  some  regions  (e.g.,  Southeast  Asia  and  the  Middle  East),  through  intergovernmental organizations such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the GCC, some countries are looking into cross-border connectivity of such domestic systems;\n- parties that process our transactions may try to minimize or eliminate our position in the payments value chain;\n- parties  that  access  our  payment  credentials,  tokens  and  technologies,  including  clients,  technology  solution providers or others might be able to migrate or steer account holders and other clients to alternative",

      "answer": "MET's market-related risks primarily involve cybersecurity threats, data breaches, and reputational damage, which could harm its business operations and financial condition. V's market-related risks include interest rate risk, equity investment risk, and pension plan risk. Specifically, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of V's fixed-rate investment securities by $47 million and increase its annual interest expense by $40 million. MET does not disclose a direct financial impact from interest rate changes, but its exposure to cybersecurity and data risks could lead to indirect financial harm through legal liabilities and reputational damage.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nOur investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate securities. Investments in fixed-rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed-rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling-rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature, the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income.\n\nAt September 30, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of our fixed-rate investment securities were $5.3 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively, and the fair value of our adjustable-rate investment securities were not material and $0.2 billion, respectively.  At  September  30,  2022,  a  hypothetical  100  basis  point  increase  in  interest  rates  would  create  an estimated decrease in the fair value of our investment securities of approximately $47 million. Any realized gains or losses  resulting  from  such  interest  rate  changes  would  only  occur  if  we  sold  the  investments  prior  to  maturity. Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity.\n\nWe have interest rate and cross-currency swap agreements on a portion of our outstanding senior notes that allow us to manage our interest rate exposure through a combination of fixed and floating rates and reduce our overall cost of borrowing.  Together  these  swap  agreements  effectively  convert  a  portion  of  our  U.S.  dollar  denominated  fixed-rate payments into U.S. dollar and Euro denominated floating-rate payments. By entering into interest rate swaps, we have assumed risks associated with market interest rate fluctuations. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an increase of approximately $40 million in annual interest expense. See Note 13-Derivative and  Non-derivative  Financial  Instruments to  our  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in Item  8-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.\n\n## Equity Investment Risk\n\nOur equity investments are held in both marketable and non-marketable equity securities. The marketable equity securities  are  publicly  traded  stocks  and  the  non-marketable  equity  securities  are  investments  in  privately  held companies.\n\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the carrying value of our marketable equity securities was $291 million and $323 million, respectively. These securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings.\n\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $1.2 billion and  $1.5  billion,  respectively.  These  investments  are  subject  to  a  wide  variety  of  market-related  risks  that  could substantially reduce or increase the carrying value of our holdings. A decline in financial condition or operating results of  these investments could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our carrying value in these companies. We regularly review our non-marketable equity securities for possible impairment, which generally involves an analysis of the facts and changes in circumstances influencing the investment, expectations of the entity's cash flows and capital needs, and the viability of its business model.\n\n## Pension Plan Risk\n\nAt September 30, 2022 and 2021, our U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, and projected benefit obligations were $0.7 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or in the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded  status  of  the  pension  plans,  an  increase  in  pension  cost  and  an  increase  in  required  funding.  As  of September 30, 2022,  a  hypothetical  10%  decrease  in  the  value  of  pension  plan  assets  and  a  1%  decrease  in  the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately $150 million in the funded status and an increase of approximately $32 million in pension cost.\n\nAt September 30, 2022 and 2021, our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $0.3 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively, and projected benefit obligations were $0.3 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or in the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in  the  funded  status  of  the  pension  plans,  an  increase  in  pension  cost  and  an  increase  in  required  funding. As  of September 30, 2022,  a  hypothetical  10%  decrease  in  the  value  of  pension  plan  assets  and  a  1%  decrease  in  the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately $82 million in the funded status and an increase of approximately $11 million in pension cost.\n\nWe will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the pension plans for fiscal 2023, if any, which would be made in September 2023.",

In contrast, Visa funds future benefits under the Visa Europe plans by contributing in accordance with agreed funding requirements with trustees, without explicitly modeling future benefits using risk-neutral valuation or incorporating risk margins and credit spreads.

The  estimated  fair  values  of  these  embedded  derivatives  are  determined  based  on  the  present  value  of  projected future benefits minus the present value of projected future fees. The projections of future benefits and future fees require capital market and actuarial assumptions, including expectations concerning policyholder behavior. A risk neutral valuation methodology is used under which the cash flows from the guarantees are projected under multiple capital market scenarios using observable riskfree rates. The valuation of these embedded derivatives also includes an adjustment for our nonperformance risk and risk margins for  non-capital  market  inputs.  The  nonperformance  risk  adjustment,  which  is  captured  as  a  spread  over  the  risk-free  rate  in determining the discount rate to discount the cash flows of the liability, is determined by taking into consideration publicly available information  relating  to  spreads  in  the  secondary  market  for  MetLife,  Inc.'s  debt,  including  related  credit  default  swaps.  These observable spreads are then adjusted, as necessary, to reflect the priority of these liabilities and the claims paying ability of the issuing insurance subsidiaries compared to MetLife, Inc. Risk margins are established to capture the non-capital market risks of the instrument  which  represent  the  additional  compensation  a  market  participant  would  require  to  assume  the  risks  related  to  the uncertainties  in  certain  actuarial  assumptions.  The  establishment  of  risk  margins  requires  the  use  of  significant  management judgment, including assumptions of the amount and cost of capital needed to cover the guarantees.\n\nThe  table  below  illustrates  the  impact  that  a  range  of  reasonably  likely  variances  in  credit  spreads  would  have  on  our consolidated balance sheet, excluding the effect of income tax, related to the embedded derivative valuation on certain variable annuity products measured at estimated fair value. In determining the ranges, we have considered current market conditions, as well as  the  market  level  of  spreads  that  can  reasonably  be  anticipated  over  the  near  term.  The  ranges  do  not  reflect  extreme  market conditions, as we do not consider those to be reasonably likely events in the near future.\n\nThe impact of the range of reasonably likely variances in credit spreads decreased as compared to prior periods. However, these estimated effects do not take into account potential changes in other variables, such as equity price levels and market volatility, which can also contribute significantly to changes in carrying values. Therefore, the table does not necessarily reflect the ultimate impact on the consolidated financial statements under the credit spread variance scenarios presented below.\n\n",

We purchase receivables related to credit extended to U.S. merchants by WebBank and are responsible for servicing functions related to that portfolio. We purchased approximately $1.8 billion in credit receivables in both the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The total outstanding balance in our pool of merchant  loans,  advances,  and  interest  and  fees  receivable  was  $1.4  billion  for  both  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  net  of  the participation  interest  sold  to  WebBank  of  $63  million  and  $59  million,  respectively.  See  'Note  1-Overview  and  Summary  of Significant Accounting Policies' for additional information on this participation arrangement.\n\nThrough our PPWC product, merchants can borrow a certain percentage of their annual payment volume processed by PayPal and are charged a fixed fee for the loan or advance based on the overall credit assessment of the merchant. Loans and advances are repaid through a fixed percentage of the merchant's future payment volume that PayPal processes. Through our PPBL product, we provide merchants access to short-term business financing for a fixed fee based on an evaluation of the applying business as well as the business owner. PPBL repayments are collected through periodic payments until the balance has been satisfied.\n\nThe interest or fee is fixed at the time the loan or advance is extended and is recognized as deferred revenue in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The fixed interest or fee is amortized into revenues from other value added services based on the amount repaid over the repayment period. We estimate the repayment period for PPWC based on the merchant's payment processing history with PayPal, where available. For PPWC, there is a general requirement that at least 10% of the original amount of the loan or advance plus the fixed fee must be repaid every 90 days. We calculate the repayment rate of the merchant's future payment volume so that repayment of the loan or advance and fixed fee is expected to generally occur within 9 to 12 months from the date of the loan or advance. On a monthly basis, we recalculate the repayment period based on the repayment activity on the receivable. As such, actual repayment periods are dependent on actual merchant payment processing volumes. For PPBL, we receive fixed periodic payments over the contractual term of the loan, which generally ranges from 3 to 12 months.\n\nWe actively monitor receivables with repayment periods greater than the original expected or contractual repayment period, as well as the credit quality of our merchant loans and advances that we extend or purchase so that we can evaluate, quantify, and manage our credit risk exposure. To assess a merchant seeking a loan or advance, we use, among other indicators, risk models developed internally which utilize information obtained from multiple internal and external data sources to predict the likelihood of timely and satisfactory repayment by the merchant of the loan or advance amount and the related interest or fee. Primary drivers of the models include the merchant's annual payment volume, payment processing history with PayPal, prior repayment history with PayPal's credit  products  where  available,  information  sourced  from  consumer  and  business  credit  bureau  reports,  and  other  information obtained  during  the  application  process.  We  use  delinquency  status  and  trends  to  assist  in  making  (or,  in  the  U.S.,  to  assist WebBank in making) ongoing credit decisions, to adjust our internal models, to plan our collection strategies, and in determining our allowance for these loans and advances.\n\n100",

Where appropriate, we manage the impact of operational loss and litigation expense through the purchase of insurance. The insurance program is specifically designed to address our key operational risks and to maintain compliance with local laws and regulation.\n\nSchwab's operations are highly dependent on the integrity and resilience of our critical business functions and technology systems. To the extent Schwab experiences business or system interruptions, errors or downtime (which could result from a variety of causes, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, technological failure, cyber attacks, changes to systems, linkages with thirdparty systems, extreme weather, and power failures), our business and operations could be negatively impacted. To minimize business interruptions and ensure the capacity to continue operations during an incident regardless of duration, Schwab maintains a backup and recovery infrastructure which includes facilities for backup and communications, a geographically dispersed workforce, and routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans and a well-established incident management program.\n\nInformation Security risk is the risk of unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, recording or destruction of the firm's information or systems. We have designed and implemented an information security program that knits together complementary tools, controls and technologies to protect systems, client accounts and data. We continuously monitor the systems and work collaboratively with government agencies, law enforcement and other financial institutions to address potential threats. We use advanced monitoring systems to identify suspicious activity and deter unauthorized access by internal or external actors. We also maintain policies and procedures, which apply to employees, contractors, and third parties, regarding the standard of care expected with all data, whether the data is internal company information, employee information, or non-public client information. This includes limiting the number of employees who have access to clients' personal information and internal authentication measures enforced to protect against the unauthorized use of employee credentials. All employees who handle sensitive information are trained in privacy and security. Schwab's conduct and cybersecurity teams monitor activity looking for suspicious behavior. These capabilities allow us to identify and quickly act on attempted intrusions.\n\nFraud risk arises from attempted or actual theft of financial assets or other property of any client or the Company. Schwab is committed to protecting the Company's and its clients' assets from fraud and complying with all applicable laws and regulations to prevent, detect and report fraudulent activity. Schwab manages fraud risk through policies, procedures and controls. We also take affirmative steps to prevent and detect fraud and report, to appropriate authorities, any known or suspected acts of fraud in accordance with existing laws and requirements.\n\nSchwab also faces operational risk when we employ the services of various third parties, including domestic and international outsourcing of certain technology, processing, servicing, and support functions. We manage the exposure to third-party risk and promote a culture of resiliency through internal policies, procedures and controls, and contractual provisions, control standards, ongoing monitoring of third-party performance, and appropriate testing with third-party service providers.\n\nModel risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. Models are owned by several business units throughout the organization, and are used for a variety of purposes. Model use includes, but is not limited to, calculating capital requirements for hypothetical stressful environments, estimating interest and credit risk for loans and other balance sheet assets, and providing guidance in the management of client portfolios. We have established a policy that aligns with Federal Reserve guidance on Model Risk Management SR11-7 to describe the roles and responsibilities of all key stakeholders in model development, management, and use. All models are registered in a centralized database and classified into different risk ratings depending on their potential financial, reputational, or regulatory impact to the Company. The model risk rating determines the scope of model governance activities.",

          "chunk_text": "## PayPal Holdings, Inc.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\n\nThe  decrease  in  the  charge-offs  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021  compared  to  2020  was  due  to  improved  portfolio performance. Additionally, charge offs increased in the year ended December 31, 2020 due to accounts that experienced financial difficulties as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFor  merchant  loans  and  advances,  the  determination  of  delinquency  is  based  on  the  current  expected  or  contractual  repayment period of the loan or advance and fixed interest or fee payment as compared to the original expected or contractual repayment period. We charge off the receivables outstanding under our PPBL product when the repayments are 180 days past the contractual repayment date. We charge off the receivables outstanding under our PPWC product when the repayments are 180 days past our expectation of repayments and the merchant has not made a payment in the last 60 days, or when the repayments are 360 days past due regardless of whether the merchant has made a payment within the last 60 days. Bankrupt accounts are charged off within 60 days  of  receiving  notification  of  bankruptcy.  The  provision  for  credit  losses  on  merchant  loans  and  advances  is  recognized  in transaction and credit losses, and the provision for interest and fees receivable is recognized as a reduction of deferred revenue in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Charge-offs that are recovered are recorded as a reduction to our allowance for loans and interest receivable.\n\n## Troubled debt restructurings\n\nIn instances where a merchant is able to demonstrate that it is experiencing financial difficulty, there may be a modification of the loan or advance and the related interest or fee receivable for which it is probable that, without modification, we will be unable to collect all amounts due. These modifications are intended to provide merchants with financial relief, and help enable us to mitigate losses.\n\nThese modifications include an increase in term by approximately 1 to 5.5 years while moving the delinquency status to current. The fee on certain of these loans or advances remains unchanged over the extended term. Alternatively, certain loans and advances have been modified to replace the initial  fixed  fee  structure  at  the  time  the  loan  or  advance  was  extended  with  a  fixed  annual percentage rate applied over the amended remaining term, which will continue to accrue interest at the fixed rate until the earlier of maturity or charge-off. These modifications had a de minimis impact on our consolidated statements of income in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nAllowances for TDRs are assessed separately from other loans and advances within our portfolio and are determined by estimating current  expected  credit  losses  utilizing  the  modified  term  and  interest  rate  assumptions.  Historical  loss  estimates  are  utilized  in addition to macroeconomic assumptions to determine expected credit loss rates. Further, we may include qualitative adjustments that incorporate incremental information not captured in the quantitative estimates of our current expected credit losses.\n\nThe following tables  show  the  merchant  loans  and  interest  receivables  which  have  been  modified  as TDRs  in  the  years  ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n\n",

Loans on nonaccrual status and other real estate owned are considered nonperforming assets.\n\n## Loan charge-offs\n\nThe Company charges off a loan in the period that it is deemed uncollectible and records a reduction in the allowance for credit losses and the loan balance. Our charge-off policy for First Mortgage and HELOC loans is to assess the value of the property when the loan has been delinquent for 180 days or has been discharged in bankruptcy proceedings, regardless of whether the property is in foreclosure, and charge-off the amount of the loan balance in excess of the estimated current value of the underlying property less estimated costs to sell. The Company's policy for PALs is to charge off any delinquent loans no later than at 90 days past due.\n\n## Equipment, office facilities, and property\n\nEquipment, office facilities, and property are recorded at cost net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, except for land, which is recorded at cost. Equipment, office facilities, and property include certain capitalized costs of acquired or internally developed software. Costs for internally developed software are capitalized when the costs relate to development of approved projects for our internal needs that result in additional functionality. Costs related to preliminary project and post-project activities are expensed as incurred. Equipment, office facilities, and property (other than land) are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Estimated useful lives are as follows:\n\n",

        "Step 1: From PYPL's 2022 10-K filing, extract the estimated fair value of asset-backed securities across all investment categories: $1,549 million (funds receivable and customer accounts) + $277 million (short-term investments) + $813 million (long-term investments) = $2,639 million.",

        "Step 3: Add the total estimated fair values from both companies: $2,639 million (PYPL) + $8,801 million (SCHW) = $11,440 million.",
        "Step 4: Extract unrealized losses: PYPL reported $3 million (funds receivable), $1 million (short-term), and $4 million (long-term) = $8 million total unrealized loss on asset-backed securities. SCHW reported $80 million in unrealized losses on its asset-backed securities.",
        "Step 5: Compare the unrealized loss positions: SCHW's unrealized loss of $80 million on $8.8 billion in asset-backed securities represents a more significant percentage loss compared to PYPL's $8 million unrealized loss on $2.6 billion in such securities."

      "answer": "MET diversifies its real estate investments across geographic regions to reduce concentration risk, with a carrying value of $13.3 billion in 2023. This strategy helps mitigate the impact of regional economic downturns on its portfolio. Meanwhile, PYPL's revenues are significantly impacted by the geographic region in which a transaction occurs, as cross-border transactions and regional economic conditions directly affect its TPV and transaction fees. Therefore, both companies are exposed to geographic risk, but MET actively manages it through diversification, while PYPL's exposure is more transactional and dependent on regional economic stability.",

        "Step 1: MET diversifies its real estate investments across geographic regions to reduce risk of concentration, as stated in the evidence, with a carrying value of $13.3 billion at the end of 2023.",
        "Step 2: PYPL's net revenues are significantly impacted by the geographic region in which a transaction occurs, as cross-border transactions and regional economic conditions influence TPV and transaction fees.",
        "Step 3: Both MET and PYPL are influenced by geographic region as a key business factor, but they experience its impact differently\u2014MET through portfolio diversification to manage risk, and PYPL through transactional revenue variability."

      "answer": "MetLife implements the Three Lines of Defense Model through its Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), who reports to the Enterprise Risk Committee (ERC), including the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), and other senior management, with regular updates to the Audit Committee and Board of Directors. The CISO also has over twenty years of professional IT experience in financial services. PayPal, on the other hand, structures its Three Lines of Defense within its Enterprise Risk and Compliance Management Program (ERCM Program), where the Office of the Chief Information Security Officer serves as the First Line of Defense (FLOD), the Technology and Information Security team as the Second Line of Defense (SLOD), and Internal Audit as the Third Line of Defense (TLOD). PayPal\u2019s model is governed by the Technology, Information Security, and Privacy Risk Management Committee and overseen by the Board and its Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee (ARC Committee).",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From MET_10k_2023.pdf, extract that MetLife\u2019s Three Lines of Defense Model is overseen by the CISO, who reports to the ERC (including the CRO), and that the CISO has over twenty years of IT experience in financial services.",
        "Step 2: From PYPL_10k_2023.pdf, extract that PayPal\u2019s Three Lines of Defense is part of the ERCM Program, with FLOD under the Office of the CISO, SLOD under the Technology and Information Security team, and TLOD under Internal Audit, governed by the Technology, Information Security, and Privacy Risk Management Committee and overseen by the ARC Committee.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the differences in governance and structure: MetLife emphasizes CISO reporting to the ERC and Board, while PayPal integrates the model into a broader ERCM Program with clearly defined FLOD, SLOD, and TLOD roles."

      "question": "How does MET's focus on offering value-added services as part of its competitive strategy compare with PYPL's categorization of revenues from value-added services, and what does this reveal about how each company leverages these services in its business model?",
      "answer": "MET emphasizes offering value-added services as part of its broader life insurance and financial services strategy to differentiate itself in a competitive market, aiming to provide comprehensive solutions alongside traditional products. This aligns with its focus on adapting to evolving customer expectations and leveraging technological efficiency. In contrast, PYPL categorizes revenues from value-added services separately, indicating that these services are a distinct and quantifiable component of its revenue stream, managed alongside transaction revenues. This suggests PYPL treats value-added services as a strategic revenue driver, integral to its financial performance and business model.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - MET's 10-K highlights that insurers are focusing on 'opportunities to offer comprehensive solutions, which include providing value-added services along with traditional products' as part of their competitive strategy.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - PYPL's 10-K categorizes its revenues into 'transaction revenues and revenues from other value added services,' indicating that these services are a distinct and material part of its revenue model.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies reference value-added services, but MET frames them in the context of competitive differentiation and customer service enhancement, while PYPL integrates them directly into its revenue reporting, suggesting differing strategic uses of the same type of service offerings."

Morgan Stanley highlights that evolving consumer protection regulations, among other regulatory requirements, could materially impact profitability, force changes in business practices, or require additional capital raises. PayPal similarly states that failure to comply with consumer protection laws could result in fines, enforcement actions, and reputational harm, especially as it operates globally and must comply with varying and sometimes conflicting regulations across jurisdictions. The shared regulatory pressure leads both firms to emphasize the need for continuous compliance investments and operational adjustments, though PayPal faces broader geographic variability in enforcement expectations.",

      "question": "How do the business limitations related to regulatory capital requirements at Morgan Stanley and PayPal's exposure to fraud losses through protection programs cumulatively impact their respective abilities to maintain financial flexibility and customer trust?",
      "answer": "Morgan Stanley faces limitations on financial flexibility due to regulatory capital constraints, such as the requirement to maintain adequate Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) and the potential inability to pay dividends or conduct capital actions without Federal Reserve approval. These constraints may restrict the efficient distribution of capital among its entities, especially during periods of stress. Meanwhile, PayPal's business limitations include significant exposure to fraud losses and liabilities through its Purchase and Seller Protection Programs, which can lead to substantial financial losses, reputational damage, and potential restrictions from card networks. The combination of these business limitations means that Morgan Stanley's ability to manage capital freely is constrained by regulatory oversight, while PayPal's financial flexibility and customer trust are challenged by ongoing fraud-related costs and evolving regulatory expectations around payment security.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Morgan Stanley is subject to TLAC requirements and may be prevented from paying dividends or taking other capital actions due to regulatory constraints.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - PayPal incurs substantial losses from fraud, protection programs, and evolving regulatory expectations, which could harm its business and financial flexibility.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies face business limitations that impact their financial flexibility, but in different ways: Morgan Stanley through regulatory capital constraints and PayPal through fraud-related liabilities and customer protection obligations."

      "answer": "MS excludes counterparty default risk from its daily net trading revenues and Value at Risk (VaR) model, meaning it does not account for such risk in its trading risk management framework. Meanwhile, PYPL warns that a counterparty default could result in significant losses due to its exposure to financial institutions through deposits, derivative transactions, and credit facilities. If a counterparty were to default, PYPL could face material financial harm, which contrasts with MS's approach of not incorporating such risk into its daily revenue and VaR calculations. This highlights how PYPL directly acknowledges the potential financial consequences of counterparty defaults, while MS does not factor them into its trading risk metrics.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from MS's 2023 10-K - Counterparty default risk is explicitly excluded from daily net trading revenues and the VaR model.",
        "Step 2: Extract from PYPL's 2023 10-K - A counterparty default could result in 'significant losses' due to exposure through deposits, derivatives, and credit facilities.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While PYPL actively warns of the financial impact of counterparty defaults, MS does not factor this risk into its risk modeling or revenue calculations, suggesting differing approaches to managing or accounting for this shared risk factor."

      "question": "How does the application of the Bank Secrecy Act and U.K. Bribery Act specifically shape Morgan Stanley's compliance obligations, and how does this compare to PayPal's approach to AML compliance in the U.K. and EU as an electronic money institution and credit institution, respectively?",
      "answer": "Morgan Stanley is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and the U.K. Bribery Act as part of its AML and anti-corruption obligations in the U.S. and jurisdictions where it operates. These laws require Morgan Stanley to implement internal controls, conduct due diligence, and report suspicious activities to prevent money laundering and corruption. Violations could lead to regulatory enforcement actions and significant civil and criminal penalties. PayPal, operating in the U.K. through PayPal U.K. Limited, is regulated as an electronic money institution by the FCA and must comply with U.K. AML regulations. In the EU, PayPal (Europe) is regulated as a credit institution by the CSSF and must also follow AML frameworks, including transaction monitoring and sanctions compliance. PayPal\u2019s AML program includes policies and internal controls to prevent illicit use of its payment platform, overseen by its AML/Bank Secrecy Act Officer. While both companies face AML obligations, Morgan Stanley\u2019s exposure is tied to broader financial services operations and anti-corruption laws, whereas PayPal\u2019s compliance focuses on digital payments and lending platforms under stricter electronic money and credit institution regulations in the U.K. and EU.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Morgan Stanley is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and U.K. Bribery Act, with violations potentially leading to enforcement actions and penalties.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - PayPal U.K. is regulated by the FCA as an electronic money institution, and PayPal (Europe) is regulated by the CSSF as a credit institution, both requiring AML compliance.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are subject to AML laws, but their compliance approaches differ based on business model and jurisdictional regulation: Morgan Stanley faces obligations under financial services and anti-corruption laws, while PayPal must comply with electronic money and credit institution frameworks focused on transaction monitoring, sanctions, and platform integrity."
