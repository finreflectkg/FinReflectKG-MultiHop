      "question": "What is the combined equity ownership percentage of Duke Energy (DUK) and NextEra Energy (NEE) in Sabal Trail Transmission, LLC, and how does this joint ownership structure reflect a strategic partnership in natural gas pipeline infrastructure?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy owns a 7.5% equity interest in Sabal Trail, while NextEra Energy owns a 42.5% equity interest through its subsidiary. Together, their combined ownership is 50%. This joint ownership reflects a strategic partnership to develop and operate the Sabal Trail Natural Gas Pipeline, which transports natural gas to Florida and is regulated by FERC.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Duke Energy has a 7.5% equity ownership interest in Sabal Trail.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - NextEra Energy has a 42.5% equity ownership interest in Sabal Trail Transmission, LLC.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Adding the two ownership percentages (7.5% + 42.5%) results in a combined ownership of 50%, indicating a shared strategic investment in the Sabal Trail pipeline infrastructure."

      "answer": "Weather impacts contributed to a $10 million decrease in Mississippi Power's wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates in 2024 due to lower customer usage. In contrast, Duke Energy noted that residential and commercial customer usage is typically more impacted by weather, with decoupling mechanisms partially mitigating the financial effects of these variations. This indicates that while Mississippi Power experienced a measurable revenue decline from weather-related usage changes, Duke Energy anticipates similar weather effects but with structural rate mechanisms helping to stabilize financial outcomes.",

          "chunk_text": "\nWholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates decreased $44 million, or 16.2%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. The decrease was largely due to decreases of $35 million associated with power supply agreements mainly due to agreements that ended in 2023 and $10 million associated with MRA customers primarily due to lower recoverable fuel costs and customer usage, partially offset by an increase in demand as a result of weather impacts.\n\nWholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Mississippi Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. In addition, Mississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and a municipality located in southeastern Mississippi under requirements cost-based electric tariffs which are subject to regulation by the FERC. The contracts with these wholesale customers represented 13.9% of Mississippi Power's total operating revenues in 2024. Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in sales for resale to non-affiliates. These opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Mississippi Power's variable cost to produce the energy. See Note 2 under \"Mississippi Power - Municipal and Rural Associations Tariff\" for additional information.\n\nWholesale revenues from sales to affiliates increased $18 million, or 9.0%, in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $60 million in capacity revenues primarily associated with a new PPA with Georgia Power and $4 million related to the price of energy driven by natural gas prices. This increase was partially offset by decreases of $31 million in capacity revenues mainly associated with Mississippi Power's lower availability of generation reserves to the Southern Company power pool and $15 million primarily related to the volume of KWH sales. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Mississippi Power Integrated Resource Plans\" for additional information.\n\nWholesale revenues from sales to affiliates will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, as approved by the FERC. The energy portion of these transactions does not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost.\n\nIn 2024, other operating revenues increased $13 million, or 33.3%, as compared to 2023 primarily due to an increase in open access transmission tariff revenues.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy Carolinas and Progress have amended their wholesale contracts to include recovery of expenditures related to Asset Retirement Obligations (AROs) for coal ash basin closure, with provisions limiting challenges to CCR cost recovery actions at FERC. This ensures that Duke Energy can recover compliance costs tied to the 2015 and 2024 EPA CCR Rules and the North Carolina Coal Ash Act through its contracts. In contrast, Southern Company faces uncertainty in cost recovery, as one of its risk factors explicitly states concern over the ability of counterparties to make payments as and when due and to perform as required, which includes potential failure to recover compliance costs. This creates a financial risk for Southern Company if counterparties default or dispute cost recovery, unlike Duke Energy, which has structured its contracts to mitigate this risk.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Duke Energy Carolinas' and Progress' wholesale contracts were amended to include recovery of expenditures related to AROs for the closure of coal ash basins, with retail disallowance parity and FERC challenge limitations.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Southern Company cites a risk factor regarding the ability of counterparties to make payments as and when due and to perform as required, which includes uncertainty in cost recovery.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Duke Energy has proactively structured its wholesale contracts to ensure cost recovery for coal ash compliance, while Southern Company faces exposure due to potential counterparty non-payment or disputes, highlighting a contrast in financial risk management strategies related to environmental compliance."

F or additional inform ation on inventory, see N ote 1 to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents, 'Sum m ary of Significant Accounting P olicies.'\n\n## Ash Basin Management\n\nThe E P A has issued regulations related to the m anagem ent of C C R  from  power plants, including the 2015 and 2024 C C R  R ules. T hese regulations classify C C R  as nonhazardous waste under R C R A and apply to electric generating sites with new and existing landfills and new and existing surface im poundm ents and establish requirem ents regarding design and operating criteria, groundwater m onitoring and corrective action, closure requirem ents and post-closure care, and recordkeeping, notifications, and internet posting requirem ents for the disposal and m anagem ent of C C R . In addition to the federal regulations, C C R  landfills and surface im poundm ents (ash basins or im poundm ents) will continue to be regulated by existing state laws, regulations and perm its, such as the N orth C arolina C oal Ash M anagem ent Act of 2014 (C oal Ash Act).\n\nEU&amp;I has and will periodically subm it to applicable authorities required site-specific coal ash im poundm ent rem ediation or closure plans. C losure plans m ust be approved and all associated perm its issued before any work can begin. At all sites requiring C C R  closure and groundwater rem ediation, closure m ethods and groundwater corrective action rem edies have been studied and factored into the estim ated retirem ent and m anagem ent costs.\n\nThe 2015 and 2024 E P A C C R  R ules and the C oal Ash Act leave the decision on cost recovery determ inations related to closure of coal ash surface im poundm ents to the norm al ratem aking processes before utility regulatory com m issions. D uke E nergy's electric utilities have included com pliance costs associated with federal and state requirem ents in their respective rate proceedings. Additionally, D uke E nergy C arolinas' and D uke E nergy P rogress' wholesale contracts were am ended to include the recovery of expenditures related to AROs for the closure of coal ash basins. The am ended contracts have retail disallowance parity or provisions lim iting challenges to C C R  cost recovery actions at F E R C . F or additional inform ation on the ash basins and recovery, see Item  7, \"O ther M atters\" and N otes 4, 5 and 10 to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents, \"R egulatory M atters,\" \"C om m itm ents and Contingencies\" and \"Asset R etirem ent O bligations,\" respectively.\n\n## Nuclear Matters\n\nDuke E nergy owns, wholly or partially, 11 operating nuclear reactors located at six operating stations. T he C rystal R iver U nit 3 perm anently ceased operation in F ebruary 2013. Nuclear insurance includes: nuclear liability coverage; property dam age coverage; nuclear accident decontam ination and prem ature decom m issioning coverage; and accidental outage coverage for losses in the event of a m ajor accidental outage. Joint owners reim burse D uke E nergy for certain expenses associated with nuclear insurance in accordance with joint owner agreem ents. The P rice-Anderson Act requires plant owners to provide for public nuclear liability claim s resulting from  nuclear incidents to the m axim um  total financial protection liability, which is approxim ately $16.2 billion. F or additional inform ation on nuclear insurance, see N ote 5 to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents, 'C om m itm ents and C ontingencies.'\n\nDuke E nergy has a significant future financial com m itm ent to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decom m ission and decontam inate each plant safely. T he N C U C  and the P SC SC  require Duke E nergy C arolinas and D uke E nergy P rogress to update cost estim ates for decom m issioning their nuclear plants every five years. T he nuclear decom m issioning liabilities are assessed and updated based on changes in cash flows provided in new studies as well as annual assessm ents to evaluate whether any indicators suggest a change in the estim ate of the AR O  is necessary.\n\nThe following table sum m arizes the fair value of N D T F  investm ents and the m ost recent site-specific nuclear decom m issioning cost studies. D ecom m issioning costs are stated in 2023 or 2024 dollars, depending on the year of the cost study, and include costs to decom m ission plant com ponents not subject to radioactive contam ination.\n\n",

      "answer": "Duke Energy faces regulatory risks that could prevent it from recovering costs incurred in providing service or doing so on a timely basis, which could negatively impact its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. This includes potential erosion of exclusive service rights and reduced cost recovery due to customer adoption of distributed generation technologies. Southern Company similarly faces uncertainty in cost recovery, noting that there is 'no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures and AROs will be fully recovered.' Both companies operate under cost-of-service regulatory models, but Duke Energy's specific exposure to customer net energy metering and distributed solar adoption adds a unique dimension to its cost recovery risk compared to Southern Company, which focuses more broadly on construction program variability and regulatory approvals.",

D uke E nergy is working to m eet growing and evolving custom er energy needs while balancing custom er reliability and affordability, and other priorities including the need to m odernize its fleet and the regulatory construct. D uke E nergy is subject to business, policy, regulatory, technology, econom ic and com petitive uncertainties and contingencies, m any of which are beyond its control and may m ake those goals difficult to achieve.\n\nFederal or state policies could be enacted that restrict the availability of, and increase the costs associated with the use of, fuels or generation technologies, such as natural gas or nuclear power, that enable D uke E nergy to reduce its carbon em issions. F or exam ple, D uke E nergy anticipates that its nuclear stations in N orth C arolina and South C arolina will continue to qualify for significant tax incentives in the form  of nuclear production tax credits under the IR A. N uclear energy is a reliable and clean energy source and nuclear tax incentives allowed under the IR A, including nuclear production tax credits, are expected to reduce the cost of the energy transition for our custom ers. If such nuclear production tax credits were elim inated or reduced, it could negatively im pact our ability to return the anticipated cost benefits to custom ers.\n\nAdditionally, new E P A rules issued in April 2024 im pose stringent G H G  em ission reduction standards, revised air toxic lim its, and wastewater discharge lim itations that m ay im pact our carbon-reduction targets, and operational tim eline and costs associated with certain new and existing generation. Supportive policies m ay be needed to facilitate the siting and cost recovery of transm ission and distribution upgrades needed to accom m odate the build out of large volum es of renewables and energy storage. Further, the approval of our state regulators will be necessary for the C om pany to continue to retire existing carbon em itting assets or m ake investm ents in new generating capacity. T he C om pany m ay be constrained by the ability to procure resources or labor needed to build new generation at a reasonable price as well as to construct projects on tim e. In addition, new technologies that are not yet com m ercially available or are unproven at utility scale will likely be needed, including carbon capture and sequestration and supporting infrastructure as well as new resources capable of following electric load over long durations such as advanced nuclear, hydrogen and long-duration storage. If these technologies are not developed or are not available at reasonable prices, or if we invest in early stage technologies that are then supplanted by technological breakthroughs, D uke E nergy's ability to achieve a net-zero target by 2050 at a cost-effective price could be at risk.\n\nMeeting the evolving and growing energy needs of our custom ers will require continued operation of our existing carbon-free technologies including nuclear and renewables. The rapid transition to and expansion of certain low-carbon resources, such as renewables without cost-effective storage, m ay challenge our ability to m eet custom er expectations of reliability and affordability in a carbon constrained environm ent, particularly as dem and increases. O ur nuclear fleet is central to our ability to m eet these objectives and custom er expectations. We are continuing to seek to renew the operating licenses of the 11 reactors we operate at six nuclear stations for an additional 20 years, extending their operating lives to and beyond m idcentury. F ailure to receive approval from  the N R C  for the relicensing of any of these reactors could affect our ability to achieve a net-zero target by 2050.\n\nAs a consequence, D uke E nergy m ay not be able to fully im plem ent or realize the anticipated results of its energy transition strategy, which m ay have an adverse effect on its financial condition.\n\n## REGULATORY, LE GISLATIVE  AND LE GAL R ISK S\n\nThe Duke E nergy R egistrants' regulated utility revenues, earnings and results of operations are dependent on state legislation and regulation that affect electric generation, electric and natural gas transmission, distribution and related activities, which may limit their ability to recover costs.\n\nThe Duke E nergy R egistrants' regulated electric and natural gas utility businesses are regulated on a cost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject to statutes and regulatory commission rules and procedures of N orth C arolina, South C arolina, F lorida, O hio, T ennessee, Indiana and Kentucky. If the D uke E nergy R egistrants' regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the state utility com m issions, retail electric and natural gas rates m ay be subject to review and possible reduction by the com m issions, which m ay decrease the D uke E nergy R egistrants' earnings. Additionally, if regulatory or legislative bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service, or do not do so on a tim ely basis, the D uke E nergy R egistrants' results of operations, financial position or cash flows could be negatively im pacted. D ifferences in regulation between jurisdictions with concurrent operations, such as N orth C arolina and South C arolina in D uke E nergy C arolinas' and D uke E nergy P rogress' service territory, m ay also result in failure to recover costs.\n\nI f legislative and regulatory structures were to evolve in such a way that the D uke E nergy R egistrants' exclusive rights to serve their regulated custom ers were eroded, their earnings could be negatively im pacted. F ederal and state regulations, laws, com m ercialization and reduction of costs and other efforts designed to prom ote and expand the use of E E measures and distributed generation technologies, such as private solar and battery storage, in D uke E nergy service territories could reduce recovery of fixed costs in D uke E nergy service territories or result in custom ers leaving the electric distribution system  and an increase in custom er net energy m etering, which allows custom ers with private solar to receive bill credits for surplus power up to the full retail credit am ount. O ver tim e, custom er adoption of these technologies could result in D uke E nergy not being able to fully recover the costs and investm ent in generation.",

Total estimated costs for fuel and purchased power commitments at December 31, 2024 for the applicable Registrants are provided in the table below. Fuel costs include purchases of coal (for the traditional electric operating companies) and natural gas (for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power), as well as the related transportation and storage. In most cases, these contracts contain provisions for price escalation, minimum purchase levels, and other financial commitments. Natural gas purchase commitments are based on various indices at the time of delivery; the amounts reflected below have been estimated based on the NYMEX future prices at December 31, 2024.

      "answer": "NEE issued $1.5 billion of equity units in August 2019, while Southern Company issued $1.725 billion in 2019 Series A Equity Units. For NEE, the interest rate on its Series I Debentures was reset to 2.403% during the remarketing process, with interest payments at this rate occurring semi-annually. Southern Company, on the other hand, structured its equity units to include a remarketing feature in 2022 where the interest rate on its Series 2019A and 2019B RSNs would reset to the applicable market rate at that time. Unlike NEE, which had a fixed reset rate determined at remarketing, Southern Company's approach exposed holders to prevailing market rates at the future remarketing date, creating potentially more variable interest rate exposure.",

Certain of the revolving line of credit facilities provide for the issuance of letters of credit which at December 31, 2021 had available capacity of approximately $1.9 billion ($647 million for FPL). The issuance of letters of credit under certain revolving line of credit facilities is subject to the aggregate commitment of the relevant banks to issue letters of credit under the applicable facility.\n\nNEE has guaranteed certain payment obligations of NEECH, including most of those under NEECH's debt, including all of its debentures and commercial paper issuances, as well as most of its payment guarantees and indemnifications. NEECH has guaranteed certain debt and other obligations of subsidiaries within the NEER segment.\n\nIn August 2019, NEECH completed a remarketing of $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of its Series I Debentures due September 1, 2021 (Series I Debentures) that were issued in August 2016 as components of equity units issued concurrently by NEE (August 2016 equity units). The Series I Debentures are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by NEE. In connection with the remarketing of the Series I Debentures, the interest rate on the Series I Debentures was reset to 2.403% per year, and interest is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing September 1, 2019. In connection with the settlement of the contracts to purchase NEE common stock that were issued as components of the August 2016 equity units, in the third quarter of 2019, NEE issued approximately 9.5 million shares of common stock (38.2 million shares after giving effect to the four-for-one stock split of NEE common stock effective October 26, 2020 (2020 stock split) in exchange for $1.5 billion.\n\nAs a result of the 2020 stock split (and adjustments related to the dividend rate), the fixed settlement rates of NEE's three outstanding series of Corporate Units have been adjusted as described below. In addition, the Corporate Units provide that the applicable market value (as described below) for each series of Corporate Units will also be adjusted (when determined) to give effect to the 2020 stock split and certain other antidilution adjustments to determine the applicable settlement rate. However, for purposes of the presentation below, corresponding adjustments were instead made to the reference prices and the threshold appreciation prices for each series of Corporate Units to present the practical effect of the antidilution adjustments as of December 31, 2021.\n\nIn September 2019, NEE sold $1.5 billion of equity units (initially consisting of Corporate Units).

If  purchased  on  the  final settlement date, as of December 31, 2021, the number of shares issued per equity unit would (subject to antidilution adjustments) range from 0.8973 shares if the applicable market value of a share of NEE common stock is less than or equal to $55.72 (the adjusted reference price) to 0.7181 shares if the applicable market value of a share is equal to or greater than $69.66 (the adjusted threshold appreciation price), with the applicable market value to be determined using the average closing prices of NEE common stock over a 20-day trading period ending August 29, 2022. Total annual distributions on the equity units are at the rate of 4.872%, consisting of interest on the debentures (2.10% per year) and payments under the stock purchase contracts (2.772% per year). The interest rate on the debentures is expected to be reset on or after March 1, 2022. A holder of an equity unit may satisfy its purchase obligation with proceeds raised from remarketing the NEECH debentures that are part of its equity unit.

If a successful remarketing does not occur on or before the third business day prior to the final settlement date, and a holder has not notified NEE of its intention to settle the stock  purchase  contract  with  cash,  the  debentures  that  are  components  of  the  Corporate  Units  will  be  used  to  satisfy  in  full  the  holders' obligations to purchase NEE common stock under the related stock purchase contracts on the final settlement date. The debentures are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by NEE.\n\nIn February 2020, NEE sold $2.5 billion of equity units (initially consisting of Corporate Units). Each equity unit has a stated amount of $50 and consists of a contract to purchase NEE common stock (stock purchase contract) and, initially, a 5% undivided beneficial ownership interest in a Series K Debenture due March 1, 2025, issued in the principal amount of $1,000 by NEECH.

Our  audits included  performing  procedures  to  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  financial  statements,  whether  due  to  error  or  fraud,  and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements of NEE and FPL that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## NEE - Operating Revenue - Unrealized Losses - Refer to Note 3 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nNEE enters into complex energy derivatives and transacts in certain markets that are thinly traded, which may result in subjective estimates of fair value that include unobservable inputs. Changes in the derivatives' fair value for power purchases and sales, fuel sales and trading activities are primarily recognized on a net basis in operating revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2021, unrealized losses associated with Level 3 transactions of $924 million are included in operating revenues in the consolidated statement of income of NEE.\n\nGiven  management  uses  complex  proprietary  models  and  unobservable  inputs  to  estimate  the  fair  value  of  Level  3  derivative  assets  and liabilities, performing audit procedures to evaluate the appropriateness of these models and inputs required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our firm specialists who possess significant quantitative and modeling expertise.",

      "answer": "NEE explicitly discloses the risk that the cost of decommissioning nuclear generation facilities could exceed the amount available in its decommissioning funds, highlighting potential financial exposure. In contrast, Southern Company only reports the accumulated provisions for external decommissioning trust funds as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, without specifying any risk related to potential shortfalls. This contrast shows that NEE provides a more detailed risk-oriented disclosure, while Southern Company's reporting focuses on historical fund balances without addressing future risk scenarios.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from NEE's filing - NEE explicitly states that decommissioning costs 'could exceed the amount available' in decommissioning funds, indicating financial risk.",
        "Step 2: Extract from Southern Company's filing - Southern Company reports accumulated decommissioning trust fund provisions as of specific dates but does not discuss the risk of cost overruns.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The difference in disclosure approaches reflects varying degrees of risk transparency, with NEE providing forward-looking risk language and Southern Company offering only historical fund data."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nNEE  and  FPL  could  recognize  financial  losses  as  a  result  of  volatility  in  the  market  values  of  derivative  instruments  and  limited liquidity in OTC markets.\n\nNEE  and  FPL  execute  transactions  in  derivative  instruments  on  either  recognized  exchanges  or  via  the  OTC  markets,  depending  on management's assessment of the most favorable credit and market execution factors. Transactions executed in OTC markets have the potential for greater volatility and less liquidity than transactions on recognized exchanges. As a result, NEE and FPL may not be able to execute desired OTC transactions due to such heightened volatility and limited liquidity.\n\nIn the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of derivative instruments involves management's judgment and use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these derivative instruments and have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\n## NEE and FPL may be materially adversely affected by negative publicity.\n\nFrom  time  to  time,  political  and  public  sentiment  may  result  in  a  significant  amount  of  adverse  press  coverage  and  other  adverse  public statements affecting NEE and FPL. Adverse press coverage and other adverse statements, whether or not driven by political or public sentiment, may also result in investigations by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials or in legal claims. Responding to these investigations and lawsuits,  regardless  of  the  ultimate  outcome  of  the  proceeding,  can  divert  the  time  and  effort  of  senior  management  from  NEE's  and  FPL's business.\n\nAddressing  any  adverse  publicity,  governmental  scrutiny  or  enforcement  or  other  legal  proceedings  is  time  consuming  and  expensive  and, regardless of the factual basis for the assertions being made, can have a negative impact on the reputation of NEE and FPL, on the morale and performance of  their  employees  and  on  their  relationships  with  regulators.  It  may  also  have  a  negative  impact  on  their  ability  to  take  timely advantage of various business and market opportunities. The direct and indirect effects of negative publicity, and the demands of responding to and addressing it, may have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE's  and  FPL's  business,  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  and  prospects  may  be  adversely  affected  if  FPL  is  unable  to maintain, negotiate or renegotiate franchise agreements on acceptable terms with municipalities and counties in Florida.\n\nFPL may negotiate franchise agreements with municipalities and counties in Florida to provide electric services within such municipalities and counties, and electricity sales generated pursuant to these agreements represent a very substantial portion of FPL's revenues. If FPL is unable to maintain, negotiate or renegotiate such franchise agreements on acceptable terms, it could contribute to lower earnings and FPL may not fully realize the anticipated benefits from significant investments and expenditures, which could adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected by work strikes or stoppages and increasing personnel costs.\n\nEmployee strikes or work stoppages could disrupt operations and lead to a loss of revenue and customers. Personnel costs may also increase due  to  inflationary  or  competitive  pressures  on  payroll  and  benefits  costs  and  revised  terms  of  collective  bargaining  agreements  with  union employees. These consequences could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE's ability to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions is subject to significant risks, including, but not limited to, the effect of increased competition for acquisitions resulting from the consolidation of the energy industry.\n\nNEE is likely to encounter significant competition for acquisition opportunities that may become available as a result of the consolidation of the energy industry in general. In addition, NEE may be unable to identify attractive acquisition opportunities at favorable prices and to complete and integrate them successfully and in a timely manner.\n\n## Nuclear Generation Risks\n\nThe operation and maintenance of NEE's and FPL's nuclear generation facilities involve environmental, health and financial risks that could result in fines or the closure of the facilities and in increased costs and capital expenditures.\n\nNEE's and FPL's nuclear generation facilities are subject to environmental, health and financial risks, including, but not limited to, those relating to site storage of spent nuclear fuel, the disposition of spent nuclear fuel, leakage and emissions of tritium and other radioactive elements in the event of a nuclear accident or otherwise, the threat of a terrorist attack or cyber incident and other potential liabilities arising out of the ownership or operation of the facilities. NEE and FPL maintain decommissioning funds and external insurance coverage which are intended to reduce the financial exposure to some of these risks; however, the cost of decommissioning nuclear generation facilities could exceed the amount available in NEE's and FPL's decommissioning funds,",

The debentures are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by NEE.\n\nIn September 2020, NEE sold $2.0 billion of equity units (initially consisting of Corporate Units). Each equity unit has a stated amount of $50 and consists of a contract to purchase NEE common stock (stock purchase contract) and, initially, a 5% undivided beneficial ownership interest in a Series L Debenture due September 1, 2025, issued in the principal amount of $1,000 by NEECH. Each stock purchase contract requires the holder to purchase by no later than September 1, 2023 (the final settlement date) for a price of $50 in cash, a number of shares of NEE common stock  (subject  to  antidilution  adjustments)  based  on  a  price  per  share  range  described  in  the  following  sentence.  If  purchased  on  the  final settlement date, as of December 31, 2021, the number of shares issued per equity unit would (subject to antidilution adjustments) range from 0.6776 shares if the applicable market value of a share of NEE common stock is less than or equal to $73.79 (the adjusted reference price) to 0.5421 shares if the applicable market value of a share is equal to or greater than $92.24 (the adjusted threshold appreciation price), with the applicable market value to be determined using the average closing prices of NEE common stock over a 20-day trading period ending August 29, 2023. Total annual distributions on the equity units are at the rate of 6.219%, consisting of interest on the debentures (0.509% per year) and payments under the stock purchase contracts (5.710% per year). The interest rate on the debentures is expected to be reset on or after March 1, 2023. A holder of an equity unit may satisfy its purchase obligation with proceeds raised from remarketing the NEECH debentures that are part of its equity unit. The undivided beneficial ownership interest in the NEECH debenture that is a component of each Corporate Unit is pledged to NEE to secure the holder's obligation to purchase NEE common stock under the related stock purchase contract. If a successful remarketing does not occur on or before the third business day prior to the final settlement date, and a holder has not notified NEE of its intention to settle the stock  purchase  contract  with  cash,  the  debentures  that  are  components  of  the  Corporate  Units  will  be  used  to  satisfy  in  full  the  holders' obligations to purchase NEE common stock under the related stock purchase contracts on the final settlement date. The debentures are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by NEE.\n\nPrior  to  the  issuance  of  NEE's  common  stock,  the  stock  purchase  contracts,  if  dilutive,  will  be  reflected  in  NEE's  diluted  earnings  per  share calculations  using  the  treasury  stock  method.  Under  this  method,  the  number  of  shares  of  NEE  common  stock  used  in  calculating  diluted earnings per share is deemed to be increased by the excess, if any, of the number of shares that would be issued upon settlement of the stock purchase contracts over the number of shares that could be purchased by NEE in the market, at the average market price during the period, using the proceeds receivable upon settlement.\n\nIn January 2022, FPL sold $1.5 billion principal amount of its First Mortgage Bonds, 2.45% Series due February 3, 2032 and sold $1.0 billion principal amount of its Floating Rate Notes, Series due January 12, 2024.\n\n## 14.

      "answer": "Duke Energy is subject to NRC requirements that mandate the maintenance of nuclear decommissioning trust funds (NDTF) to cover the costs of decommissioning nuclear plants. These funds are invested in equity and debt securities and are exposed to market risks. Southern Company's subsidiaries, such as Alabama Power and Georgia Power, estimate decommissioning costs based on site studies, with the most recent estimates performed in 2018 and 2021 respectively. These estimates assume prompt dismantlement and removal of plants, but actual costs may vary due to changes in NRC requirements or other assumptions. For Duke Energy, fluctuations in the fair value of NDTF investments are primarily deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities, meaning changes in investment values do not materially affect the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the short term, but will ultimately impact the amount of costs recovered through retail and wholesale rates. For Southern Company, variability in decommissioning cost estimates directly affects long-term financial planning, as actual costs may differ significantly from current estimates due to regulatory changes or updated assumptions, potentially requiring additional funding or rate adjustments.",

          "chunk_text": "## Marketable Securities Price Risk\n\nAs described further in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 'Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,' Duke Energy invests in debt and equity securities as part of various investment portfolios to fund certain obligations. The vast majority of investments in equity securities are within the NDTF and assets of the various pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.\n\n## Pension Plan Assets\n\nDuke Energy maintains investments to facilitate funding the costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit retirement and other post-retirement benefit plans. These investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates. The equity securities held in these pension plans are diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of any single investment, sector or geographic region. Duke Energy has established asset allocation targets for its pension plan holdings, which take into consideration the investment objectives and the risk profile with respect to the trust in which the assets are held. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 'Employee Benefit Plans,' for additional information regarding investment strategy of pension plan assets.\n\nA significant decline in the value of plan asset holdings could require Duke Energy to increase funding of its pension plans in future periods, which could adversely affect cash flows in those periods. Additionally, a decline in the fair value of plan assets, absent additional cash contributions to the plan, could increase the amount of pension cost required to be recorded in future periods, which could adversely affect Duke Energy's results of operations in those periods.\n\n## Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds\n\nAs required by the NRC, NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC, subsidiaries of Duke Energy maintain trust funds to fund the costs of nuclear decommissioning. As of December 31, 2021, these funds were invested primarily in domestic and international equity securities, debt securities, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Per the NRC, Internal Revenue Code, NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC requirements, these funds may be used only for activities related to nuclear decommissioning. These investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates. Duke Energy actively monitors its portfolios by benchmarking the performance of its investments against certain indices and by maintaining, and periodically reviewing, target allocation percentages for various asset classes.\n\nAccounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that costs are recovered through retail and wholesale rates; therefore, fluctuations in investment prices do not materially affect the Consolidated Statements of Operations, as changes in the fair value of these investments are primarily deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities pursuant to Orders by the NCUC, PSCSC, FPSC and FERC. Earnings or losses of the funds will ultimately impact the amount of costs recovered through retail and wholesale rates. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 'Asset Retirement Obligations,' for additional information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 'Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,' for additional information regarding NDTF assets.\n\n## OTHER MATTERS\n\n## Environmental Regulations\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are subject to federal, state and local regulations regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal, coal ash and other environmental matters. These regulations can be changed from time to time and result in new obligations of the Duke Energy Registrants.\n\nThe following sections outline various proposed and recently enacted legislation and regulations that may impact the Duke Energy Registrants. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for further information regarding potential plant retirements and regulatory filings related to the Duke Energy Registrants.\n\n## Coal Combustion Residuals\n\nIn April 2015, EPA published a rule to regulate the disposal of CCR from electric utilities as solid waste. The federal regulation classifies CCR as nonhazardous waste and allows for beneficial use of CCR with some restrictions. The regulation applies to all new and existing landfills, new and existing surface impoundments receiving CCR and existing surface impoundments located at stations generating electricity (regardless of fuel source), which were no longer receiving CCR but contained liquids as of the effective date of the rule. The rule establishes requirements regarding landfill design, structural integrity design and assessment criteria for surface impoundments, groundwater monitoring, protection and remedial procedures and other operational and reporting procedures to ensure the safe disposal and management of CCR.\n\nOn July 17, 2018, EPA issued a final rule (Phase 1, Part 1) revising certain closure deadlines and groundwater protection standards in the CCR rule. The rule does not change the primary requirements for groundwater monitoring, corrective action, inspections and maintenance, and closure, and thus does not materially affect Duke Energy's coal ash basin closure plans or compliance obligations under the CCR rule. On October 22, 2018, a coalition of environmental groups filed a petition for review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (D.C. Circuit Court) challenging EPA's final Phase 1, Part 1 revisions to the CCR rule. On March 13, 2019, the D.C. Circuit Court issued an order in the Phase 1, Part 1 litigation granting EPA's motion to remand the rule without vacatur. To date, EPA has finalized two notice-and-comment rulemakings to implement the court's decision on remand. The 'Part A' rule, which was promulgated on August 28, 2020, establishes an April 11, 2021 deadline to cease placement of CCR and non-CCR waste streams into unlined ash basins and initiate closure, and the 'Part B' rule, which was promulgated on November 12, 2020, establishes procedures to allow facilities to request approval to operate an existing CCR surface impoundment with an alternate liner.\n\nIn addition to the requirements of the federal CCR rule, CCR landfills and surface impoundments will continue to be regulated by the states. Cost recovery for future expenditures will be pursued through the normal ratemaking process with federal and state utility commissions and via wholesale contracts, which permit recovery of necessary and prudently incurred costs associated with Duke Energy's regulated operations.

      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) faces regulatory lag in recovering costs associated with coal ash basin excavations and energy efficiency (EE) programs, which could negatively impact its cash flows. Specifically, Duke has incurred significant expenditures to excavate seven of nine coal ash basins in North Carolina and seeks cost recovery through ratemaking, though there is no guarantee of full recovery. Additionally, EE programs that reduce customer demand could further reduce sales, and regulatory lag in adjusting rates could negatively affect Duke's financial position. Southern Company (SO) also faces regulatory lag risks, particularly in recovering costs of new generation and transmission assets or natural gas infrastructure, which could lead to under-recovery of capital expenditures. Since both companies operate under similar utility regulatory frameworks where cost recovery depends on regulatory approval timing, the financial exposure from regulatory lag at Duke could set a precedent or signal increased scrutiny in Southern Company's rate cases, thereby increasing its capital recovery risk and potentially lowering investor confidence.",

          "chunk_text": "## RISK FACTORS\n\nDuring 2015, EPA regulations were enacted related to the management of CCR from power plants. These regulations classify CCR as nonhazardous waste under the RCRA and apply to electric generating sites with new and existing landfills and, new and existing surface impoundments, and establish requirements regarding landfill design, structural integrity design and assessment criteria for surface impoundments, groundwater monitoring, protection and remedial procedures and other operational and reporting procedures for the disposal and management of CCR. In addition to the federal regulations, CCR landfills and surface impoundments will continue to be regulated by existing state laws, regulations and permits, as well as additional legal requirements that may be imposed in the future, such as the settlement reached with the NCDEQ to excavate seven of the nine remaining coal ash basins in North Carolina, and partially excavate the remaining two, and EPA's January 11, 2022, issuance of a letter interpreting the CCR Rule, including its applicability and closure provisions. These federal and state laws, regulations and other legal requirements may require or result in additional expenditures, including increased operating and maintenance costs, which could affect the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants. The Duke Energy Registrants will continue to seek full cost recovery for expenditures through the normal ratemaking process with state and federal utility commissions, who permit recovery in rates of necessary and prudently incurred costs associated with the Duke Energy Registrants' regulated operations, and through other wholesale contracts with terms that contemplate recovery of such costs, although there is no guarantee of full cost recovery. In addition, the timing for and amount of recovery of such costs could have a material adverse impact on Duke Energy's cash flows.\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants have recognized significant AROs related to these CCR-related requirements. Closure activities began in 2015 at the four sites specified as high priority by the Coal Ash Act and at the W.S. Lee Steam Station site in South Carolina in connection with other legal requirements. Excavation at these sites involves movement of CCR materials to off-site locations for use as structural fill, to appropriate engineered off-site or on-site lined landfills or conversion of the ash for beneficial use. Duke Energy has completed excavation of coal ash at three of the four high priority sites. At other sites, planning and closure methods have been studied and factored into the estimated retirement and management costs, and closure activities have commenced. As the closure and CCR management work progresses and final closure plans and corrective action measures are developed and approved at each site, the scope and complexity of work and the amount of CCR material could be greater than estimates and could, therefore, materially increase compliance expenditures and rate impacts.\n\n## The Duke Energy Registrants' results of operations, financial position and cash flows may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customers, or decline in customer demand or number of customers.\n\nGrowth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and natural gas and the need for additional power generation and delivery facilities. Customer growth and customer usage are affected by several factors outside the control of the Duke Energy Registrants, such as mandated EE measures, demand-side management goals, distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity.\n\nCertain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain dates in response to concerns related to climate change. Additionally, technological advances driven by federal laws mandating new levels of EE in end-use electric and natural gas devices or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption.\n\nAdvances in distributed generation technologies that produce power, including fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines and solar cells, may reduce the cost of alternative methods of producing power to a level competitive with central power station electric production utilized by the Duke Energy Registrants. In addition, the electrification of buildings and appliances currently relying on natural gas could reduce the number of customers in our natural gas distribution business.\n\nSome or all of these factors could result in a lack of growth or decline in customer demand for electricity or number of customers and may cause the failure of the Duke Energy Registrants to fully realize anticipated benefits from significant capital investments and expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nFurthermore, the Duke Energy Registrants currently have EE riders in place to recover the cost of EE programs in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky. Should the Duke Energy Registrants be required to invest in conservation measures that result in reduced sales from effective conservation, regulatory lag in adjusting rates for the impact of these measures could have a negative financial impact.\n\n## The Duke Energy Registrants future results may be impacted by changing expectations and demands including heightened emphasis on environmental, social and governance concerns.\n\nDuke Energy's ability to execute its strategy and achieve anticipated financial outcomes are influenced by the expectations of our customers, regulators, investors, and stakeholders. Those expectations are based in part on the core fundamentals of reliability and affordability but are also increasingly focused on our ability to meet rapidly changing demands for new and varied products, services and offerings. Additionally, the risks of global climate change continues to shape our customers' sustainability goals and energy needs as well as the investment and financing criteria of investors. Failure to meet these increasing expectations or to adequately address the risks and external pressures from regulators, customers, investors and other stakeholders may impact Duke Energy's reputation and affect its ability to achieve favorable outcomes in future rate cases and the results of operations for the Duke Energy Registrants. Furthermore, the increasing use of social media may accelerate and increase the potential scope of negative publicity we might receive and could increase the negative impact on our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\nAs it relates to electric generation, a diversified fleet with increasingly clean generation resources may facilitate more efficient financing and lower costs. Conversely, jurisdictions utilizing more carbon-intensive generation such as coal may experience difficulty attracting certain investors and obtaining the most economical financing terms available. Furthermore, with this heightened emphasis on environmental, social, and governance concerns, and climate change in particular, there is an increased risk of litigation by activists.",

The Registrants, Southern Company Gas Capital, and Nicor Gas could experience a downgrade in their ratings if any rating agency concludes that the level of business or financial risk of the industry or the applicable company has deteriorated. Changes in ratings methodologies by the agencies could also have a negative impact on credit ratings. If one or more rating agencies downgrade any Registrant, Southern Company Gas Capital, or Nicor Gas, borrowing costs likely would increase, including potential automatic increases in interest rates under applicable term loans and credit facilities, the pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and, particularly for any downgrade to below investment grade, significant collateral requirements may be triggered in a number of contracts. Any credit rating downgrades could require altering the mix of debt financing currently used and could require the issuance of secured indebtedness and/or indebtedness with additional restrictive covenants binding the applicable company.\n\n## Uncertainty in demand for energy can result in lower earnings or higher costs.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power each engage in a long-term planning process to estimate the optimal mix and timing of new generation assets required to serve future load obligations. Southern Company Gas engages in a long-term planning process to estimate the optimal mix and timing of building new pipelines and storage facilities, replacing existing pipelines, rewatering storage facilities, and entering new markets and/or expanding in existing markets. These planning processes must project many years into the future to accommodate the long lead times associated with the permitting and construction of new generation and associated transmission facilities and natural gas distribution and storage facilities. Inherent risk exists in predicting demand as future loads are dependent on many uncertain factors, including economic conditions, customer usage patterns, efficiency programs, customer technology adoption, and the duration and extent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Because regulators may not permit the traditional electric operating companies or the natural gas distribution utilities to adjust rates to recover the costs of new generation and associated transmission assets and/or new pipelines and related infrastructure in a timely manner or at all, these subsidiaries may not be able to fully recover these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the incurrence of costs and the recovery in customers' rates. In addition, under Southern Power's model of selling capacity and energy at negotiated market-based rates under long-term PPAs, Southern Power might not be able to fully execute its business plan if market prices drop below original forecasts. Southern Power and/or the traditional electric operating companies may not be able to extend or replace existing PPAs upon expiration, or they may be forced to market these assets at prices lower than originally intended.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies are currently obligated to supply power to retail customers and wholesale customers under long-term PPAs. Southern Power is currently obligated to supply power to wholesale customers under long-term PPAs. At peak times, the demand for power required to meet this obligation could exceed the Southern Company system's available generation capacity. Market or competitive forces may require that the traditional electric operating companies purchase capacity in the open market or build additional generation and transmission facilities and that Southern Power purchase energy or capacity in the open market. Because regulators may not permit the traditional electric operating companies to pass all of these purchase or construction costs on to their customers, the traditional electric operating companies may not be able to recover some or all of these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the incurrence of costs of purchased or constructed capacity and the traditional electric operating companies' recovery in customers' rates. Under Southern Power's long-term fixed price PPAs, Southern Power may not be able to recover all of these costs.\n\n## The businesses of the Registrants and Nicor Gas are dependent on their ability to successfully access capital through capital markets and financial institutions.\n\nThe Registrants and Nicor Gas rely on access to both short-term money markets and longer-term capital markets as a significant source of liquidity to meet capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from their respective operations. If any of the Registrants or Nicor Gas is not able to access capital at competitive rates or on favorable terms, its ability to implement its business plan will be limited due to weakened capacity to fund capital investments or acquisitions that it may otherwise rely on to achieve future earnings and cash flows. In addition, the Registrants and Nicor Gas rely on committed credit facilities as back-up liquidity for access to low cost money markets. Certain market disruptions, including an economic downturn or uncertainty, bankruptcy or financial distress at an unrelated utility company, financial institution, or sovereign entity, capital markets volatility and disruption, either nationally or internationally, changes in tax policy, volatility in market prices for electricity and natural gas, actual or threatened cyber or physical attacks on facilities within the Southern Company system or owned by unrelated utility companies, future impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic or other pandemic health events, war or threat of war, or the overall health of the utility and financial institution industries, may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect the ability to raise capital through the issuance of securities or other borrowing arrangements or the ability to secure committed bank lending agreements used as back-up sources of capital. Furthermore, some financial institutions may be limited in their ability to provide capital to the Registrants as a result of such financial institution's investment criteria, including criteria related to GHG.\n\nAdditionally, due to a portion of the Registrants' and Southern Company Gas Capital's indebtedness bearing interest at variable rates based on LIBOR or other floating benchmark rates, the announced phasing out of these rates may adversely affect the",

The rate increase is driven by significant infrastructure upgrade investments since Piedmont's previous rate case. Approximately half of the plant additions being added to rate base are categories of capital investment not covered under the IMR mechanism, which was approved in 2013. Piedmont amended its requested increase to approximately $26 million in December 2020. As authorized under Tennessee law, Piedmont implemented interim rates on January 2, 2021, at the level requested in its adjusted request. A settlement reached with the Tennessee Consumer Advocate in mid-January was approved by the TPUC on February 16, 2021. The settlement results in an increase of revenues of approximately $16 million and an ROE of 9.8%. Revised customer rates became effective on January 2, 2021. Piedmont refunded customers the difference between bills previously rendered under interim rates and such bills if rendered under approved rates, plus interest in April 2021.\n\n## 2021 North Carolina Rate Case\n\nOn March 22, 2021, Piedmont filed an application with the NCUC for a rate increase for retail customers of approximately $109 million, which represents an approximate 10% increase in retail revenues. The rate increase is driven by customer growth and significant infrastructure upgrade investments (plant additions) since the last general rate case. Approximately 70% of the plant additions being rolled into rate base are categories of plant investment not covered under the IMR mechanism, which was originally approved as part of the 2013 North Carolina Rate Case. On July 28, 2021, Piedmont amended its requested increase to approximately $97 million.\n\nOn September 7, 2021, Piedmont and the Public Staff, the Carolina Utility Customers Association, Inc. and the Carolina Industrial Group for Fair Utility Rates IV filed a Stipulation of Partial Settlement (Stipulation), which is subject to review and approval by the NCUC, resolving most issues between these parties. Major components of the Stipulation include:\n\n- A return on equity of 9.6% and a capital structure of 51.6% equity and 48.4% debt;\n- Continuation of the IMR mechanism and margin decoupling; and\n- A base rate increase of approximately $67 million, subject to completion of the Robeson County LNG facility and the Pender Onslow County expansion project.\n\nAn evidentiary hearing to review the Stipulation and other issues concluded on September 9, 2021. On October 12, 2021, Piedmont notified the NCUC of its intent to implement the stipulated rates effective November 1, 2021, on a temporary basis and subject to refund. On October 18, 2021, Piedmont and the Public Staff filed supplemental testimony attesting to the completion of the Robeson County LNG facility and the Pender Onslow County expansion project and to the propriety of including the capital investment for these two projects in this proceeding. On January 6, 2022, the NCUC issued an order approving the Stipulation. No refunds need to be rendered to customers arising from Piedmont's implementation of interim rates.\n\n## OTHER REGULATORY MATTERS\n\n## Atlantic Coast Pipeline, LLC\n\nAtlantic Coast Pipeline (ACP pipeline) was planned to be an approximately 600-mile interstate natural gas pipeline running from West Virginia to North Carolina. Duke Energy indirectly owns a 47% interest, which is accounted for as an equity method investment through its Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment.\n\nAs a result of the uncertainty created by various legal rulings, the potential impact on the cost and schedule for the project, the ongoing legal challenges and the risk of additional legal challenges and delays through the construction period and Dominion's decision to sell substantially all of its gas transmission and storage segment assets, Duke Energy's Board of Directors and management decided that it was not prudent to continue to invest in the project. On July 5, 2020, Duke Energy and Dominion announced the cancellation of the ACP pipeline project.\n\nAs part of the pretax charges to earnings of approximately $2.1 billion recorded in June 2020, within Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates on the Duke Energy Consolidated Statements of Operations, Duke Energy established liabilities related to the cancellation of the ACP pipeline project. In February 2021, Duke Energy paid approximately $855 million to fund ACP's outstanding debt, relieving Duke Energy of its guarantee. At December 31, 2021, there is $47 million and $53 million within Other Current Liabilities and Other Noncurrent Liabilities, respectively, in the Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment. The liabilities represent Duke Energy's obligation of approximately $100 million to satisfy remaining ARO requirements to restore construction sites.\n\nSee Notes 7 and 12 for additional information regarding this transaction.",

In contrast, Duke Energy Florida maintains a storm damage reserve and has a regulatory mechanism through the FPSC that allows for expedited recovery of costs from named storms.

Unit 3 with a capacity of 270 MW and a net book value of $26 million at December 31, 2020, was retired in March 2021, and unit 2 with a capacity of 167 MW and a net book value of $44 million at December 31, 2020, was retired in December 2021.\n\n(b)    These units were included in the IRP filed by Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress in North Carolina and South Carolina on September 1, 2020. The long-term energy options considered in the IRP could result in retirement of these units earlier than their current estimated useful lives. In 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed North Carolina rate cases that included depreciation studies that accelerate end-of-life dates for these plants. The NCUC issued orders in the 2019 rate cases of Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress on March 31, 2021, and April 16, 2021, respectively, in which the proposals to shorten the remaining depreciable lives of these units were denied, while indicating the IRP proceeding was the appropriate proceeding for the review of generating plant retirements.

The Duke Energy Registrants' coverage includes (i) commercial general liability coverage for liabilities arising to third parties for bodily injury and property damage; (ii) workers' compensation; (iii) automobile liability coverage; and (iv) property coverage for all real and personal property damage. Real and personal property damage coverage excludes electric transmission and distribution lines, but includes damages arising from boiler and machinery breakdowns, earthquakes, flood damage and extra expense, but not outage or replacement power coverage. All coverage is subject to certain deductibles or retentions, sublimits, exclusions, terms and conditions common for companies with similar types of operations. The Duke Energy Registrants self-insure their electric transmission and distribution lines against loss due to storm damage and other natural disasters. As discussed further in Note 3, Duke Energy Florida maintains a storm damage reserve and has a regulatory mechanism to recover the cost of named storms on an expedited basis.\n\nThe cost of the Duke Energy Registrants' coverage can fluctuate from year to year reflecting claims history and conditions of the insurance and reinsurance markets.",

A settlement reached with the Tennessee Consumer Advocate in mid-January was approved by the TPUC on February 16, 2021. The settlement results in an increase of revenues of approximately $16 million and an ROE of 9.8%. Revised customer rates became effective on January 2, 2021. Piedmont refunded customers the difference between bills previously rendered under interim rates and such bills if rendered under approved rates, plus interest in April 2021.\n\n## 2021 North Carolina Rate Case\n\nOn March 22, 2021, Piedmont filed an application with the NCUC for a rate increase for retail customers of approximately $109 million, which represents an approximate 10% increase in retail revenues. The rate increase is driven by customer growth and significant infrastructure upgrade investments (plant additions) since the last general rate case. Approximately 70% of the plant additions being rolled into rate base are categories of plant investment not covered under the IMR mechanism, which was originally approved as part of the 2013 North Carolina Rate Case. On July 28, 2021, Piedmont amended its requested increase to approximately $97 million.\n\nOn September 7, 2021, Piedmont and the Public Staff, the Carolina Utility Customers Association, Inc. and the Carolina Industrial Group for Fair Utility Rates IV filed a Stipulation of Partial Settlement (Stipulation), which is subject to review and approval by the NCUC, resolving most issues between these parties. Major components of the Stipulation include:\n\n- A return on equity of 9.6% and a capital structure of 51.6% equity and 48.4% debt;\n- Continuation of the IMR mechanism and margin decoupling; and\n- A base rate increase of approximately $67 million, subject to completion of the Robeson County LNG facility and the Pender Onslow County expansion project.\n\nAn evidentiary hearing to review the Stipulation and other issues concluded on September 9, 2021. On October 12, 2021, Piedmont notified the NCUC of its intent to implement the stipulated rates effective November 1, 2021, on a temporary basis and subject to refund. On October 18, 2021, Piedmont and the Public Staff filed supplemental testimony attesting to the completion of the Robeson County LNG facility and the Pender Onslow County expansion project and to the propriety of including the capital investment for these two projects in this proceeding. On January 6, 2022, the NCUC issued an order approving the Stipulation. No refunds need to be rendered to customers arising from Piedmont's implementation of interim rates.\n\n## OTHER REGULATORY MATTERS\n\n## Atlantic Coast Pipeline, LLC\n\nAtlantic Coast Pipeline (ACP pipeline) was planned to be an approximately 600-mile interstate natural gas pipeline running from West Virginia to North Carolina. Duke Energy indirectly owns a 47% interest, which is accounted for as an equity method investment through its Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment.\n\nAs a result of the uncertainty created by various legal rulings, the potential impact on the cost and schedule for the project, the ongoing legal challenges and the risk of additional legal challenges and delays through the construction period and Dominion's decision to sell substantially all of its gas transmission and storage segment assets, Duke Energy's Board of Directors and management decided that it was not prudent to continue to invest in the project. On July 5, 2020, Duke Energy and Dominion announced the cancellation of the ACP pipeline project.\n\nAs part of the pretax charges to earnings of approximately $2.1 billion recorded in June 2020, within Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates on the Duke Energy Consolidated Statements of Operations, Duke Energy established liabilities related to the cancellation of the ACP pipeline project. In February 2021, Duke Energy paid approximately $855 million to fund ACP's outstanding debt, relieving Duke Energy of its guarantee. At December 31, 2021, there is $47 million and $53 million within Other Current Liabilities and Other Noncurrent Liabilities, respectively, in the Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment. The liabilities represent Duke Energy's obligation of approximately $100 million to satisfy remaining ARO requirements to restore construction sites.\n\nSee Notes 7 and 12 for additional information regarding this transaction.",

      "question": "How does the adoption of distributed generation technologies, such as private solar and battery storage, threaten the cost recovery models of both Duke Energy and Southern Company Gas, and what specific regulatory mechanisms are each utility relying on to mitigate this financial risk?",
      "answer": "The adoption of distributed generation technologies, such as private solar and battery storage, threatens Duke Energy's ability to recover fixed costs in its service territories, as increased customer net energy metering allows customers with private solar to receive bill credits for surplus power up to the full retail credit amount. This could lead to a reduction in revenue and an increase in the number of customers leaving the electric distribution system. Duke Energy relies on mechanisms like margin decoupling in North Carolina and rate stabilization in South Carolina to stabilize utility margins and mitigate this risk. Similarly, Southern Company Gas faces potential competition from distributed generation technologies, which could reduce its customer base and impact its revenue model. Southern Company Gas relies on regulatory protections such as the Territorial Electric Service Act of 1973 in Georgia and the Utility Act of 1956 in Mississippi, which grant exclusive service rights and require regulatory approval for new entrants to serve in existing territories. These mechanisms help both companies maintain revenue stability despite the threat posed by distributed generation technologies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Duke Energy notes that distributed generation technologies, such as private solar and battery storage, could reduce recovery of fixed costs or result in customers leaving the electric distribution system, citing the full retail credit under net energy metering.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source A - Duke Energy uses mechanisms like margin decoupling in North Carolina and rate stabilization in South Carolina to stabilize utility margins.",
        "Step 3: Extract from source B - Southern Company Gas faces competition from distributed generation technologies and relies on the Territorial Electric Service Act of 1973 in Georgia and the Utility Act of 1956 in Mississippi for exclusive service rights.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - Both companies are impacted by distributed generation technologies that threaten their revenue models. Each utility uses specific regulatory mechanisms to mitigate the financial risks associated with these technologies."

      "answer": "Duke Energy explicitly notes that advances in distributed generation technologies, such as solar cells and wind turbines, may reduce customer demand for electricity, which could negatively affect their results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. This concern is tied to potential declines in per capita energy consumption and the risk of slower customer growth, both of which could undermine the return on significant capital investments. In contrast, Southern Company acknowledges the competitive pressures from distributed generation technologies and self-generation, noting that these factors influence the degree of competition within their retail service territories and affect their wholesale market strategies. While Duke Energy focuses on the demand-side risk and its implications for cost recovery and cash flows, Southern Company emphasizes the competitive landscape and the need to maintain reliability and cost containment in response to these technologies. Both companies are adapting their capital investment planning, with Duke Energy seeking full cost recovery through regulatory mechanisms and Southern Company focusing on maintaining competitive advantage in a shifting market.",

      "answer": "Both Duke Energy and Southern Company elect to exclude the cross-currency basis spread from the assessment of hedge effectiveness for fair value hedges related to foreign currency risk. However, Duke Energy records the difference between the change in the fair value of the excluded components and the amounts recognized in earnings as a component of other comprehensive income or loss (OCI/OCIL). Southern Company does the same, noting that the difference is recorded as a component of OCI. This means that both companies defer the impact of the cross-currency basis spread on earnings by recognizing it in OCI instead, which affects equity directly but not current earnings. This treatment results in a similar financial impact for both companies: smoothing earnings volatility at the expense of OCI volatility.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Duke Energy explicitly states that it excludes the cross-currency basis spread from the assessment of effectiveness in fair value hedges and records the difference as a component of other comprehensive income or loss (OCI/OCIL).",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Southern Company also excludes the cross-currency basis spread from hedge effectiveness assessment and records the difference as a component of OCI.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies use the same accounting policy for the cross-currency basis spread in fair value hedges, which results in the same financial treatment: deferring the impact to OCI rather than recognizing it immediately in earnings, thereby affecting equity rather than current income."

NEE specifically discloses $1.5 billion in capitalized development costs for wind and solar facilities as of December 31, 2023, which includes land rights and third-party costs directly associated with project development. These costs are either transferred to construction work in progress or charged to O&M expenses depending on the project's status. In contrast, SO does not provide a specific dollar amount for its wind facility AROs, only stating that its ARO liability for Southern Power primarily relates to solar and wind facilities under long-term land leases requiring land restoration at lease end. SO further explains that certain retirement obligations cannot be reasonably estimated due to indeterminate settlement timing. This lack of quantification from SO, combined with NEE's detailed but project-specific disclosures, prevents a comprehensive assessment of total wind facility obligations across these utility providers.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - NEE discloses $1.5 billion in capitalized development costs for wind and solar facilities as of December 31, 2023.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - SO states that its ARO liability for Southern Power primarily relates to solar and wind facilities, but does not provide a specific dollar amount.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The inconsistency in disclosure specificity between NEE's quantified $1.5 billion figure and SO's qualitative description of wind facility AROs creates challenges in aggregating total financial obligations for wind facilities across the two companies."

      "question": "What is the total amount of unutilized federal ITCs and PTCs held by Southern Company and Southern Power in 2023, and how does Southern Power expect to utilize these credits, particularly in relation to its wind facilities?",
      "answer": "Southern Company had approximately $0.8 billion and Southern Power had $0.5 billion of unutilized federal ITCs and PTCs at the end of 2023. Southern Power expects to fully utilize these credits by 2029, primarily through its investments in wind facilities, which generate PTCs based on the first 10 years of energy production, directly impacting its cash flows and net income.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_b - Southern Company and Southern Power had $0.8 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively, of unutilized federal ITCs and PTCs at December 31, 2023.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Southern Power's PTCs relate to the first 10 years of energy production from its wind facilities, which have had a material impact on its cash flows and net income.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b - These unutilized tax credits are expected to be fully utilized by 2029, although utilization could be delayed.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The total unutilized tax credits held by both entities amount to $1.3 billion, with Southern Power's portion being significantly influenced by its wind facilities' production under the PTC program."

      "answer": "Both NEE and Southern Company face increased operational costs and compliance challenges due to mandatory reliability standards. NEE may incur higher operating costs and capital expenditures to meet these standards, and if found non-compliant, could face substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions. Southern Company, on the other hand, must maintain reliability consistent with customer expectations while transitioning its generating fleet to support its net-zero goal, which includes compliance with these same standards.

          "chunk_text": "## RISK FACTORS\n\nDuring 2015, EPA regulations were enacted related to the management of CCR from power plants. These regulations classify CCR as nonhazardous waste under the RCRA and apply to electric generating sites with new and existing landfills and, new and existing surface impoundments, and establish requirements regarding landfill design, structural integrity design and assessment criteria for surface impoundments, groundwater monitoring, protection and remedial procedures and other operational and reporting procedures for the disposal and management of CCR. In addition to the federal regulations, CCR landfills and surface impoundments will continue to be regulated by existing state laws, regulations and permits, as well as additional legal requirements that may be imposed in the future, such as the settlement reached with the NCDEQ to excavate seven of the nine remaining coal ash basins in North Carolina, and partially excavate the remaining two, and EPA's January 11, 2022, issuance of a letter interpreting the CCR Rule, including its applicability and closure provisions. These federal and state laws, regulations and other legal requirements may require or result in additional expenditures, including increased operating and maintenance costs, which could affect the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants. The Duke Energy Registrants will continue to seek full cost recovery for expenditures through the normal ratemaking process with state and federal utility commissions, who permit recovery in rates of necessary and prudently incurred costs associated with the Duke Energy Registrants' regulated operations, and through other wholesale contracts with terms that contemplate recovery of such costs, although there is no guarantee of full cost recovery. In addition, the timing for and amount of recovery of such costs could have a material adverse impact on Duke Energy's cash flows.\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants have recognized significant AROs related to these CCR-related requirements. Closure activities began in 2015 at the four sites specified as high priority by the Coal Ash Act and at the W.S. Lee Steam Station site in South Carolina in connection with other legal requirements. Excavation at these sites involves movement of CCR materials to off-site locations for use as structural fill, to appropriate engineered off-site or on-site lined landfills or conversion of the ash for beneficial use. Duke Energy has completed excavation of coal ash at three of the four high priority sites. At other sites, planning and closure methods have been studied and factored into the estimated retirement and management costs, and closure activities have commenced. As the closure and CCR management work progresses and final closure plans and corrective action measures are developed and approved at each site, the scope and complexity of work and the amount of CCR material could be greater than estimates and could, therefore, materially increase compliance expenditures and rate impacts.\n\n## The Duke Energy Registrants' results of operations, financial position and cash flows may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customers, or decline in customer demand or number of customers.\n\nGrowth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and natural gas and the need for additional power generation and delivery facilities. Customer growth and customer usage are affected by several factors outside the control of the Duke Energy Registrants, such as mandated EE measures, demand-side management goals, distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity.\n\nCertain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain dates in response to concerns related to climate change. Additionally, technological advances driven by federal laws mandating new levels of EE in end-use electric and natural gas devices or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption.\n\nAdvances in distributed generation technologies that produce power, including fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines and solar cells, may reduce the cost of alternative methods of producing power to a level competitive with central power station electric production utilized by the Duke Energy Registrants. In addition, the electrification of buildings and appliances currently relying on natural gas could reduce the number of customers in our natural gas distribution business.\n\nSome or all of these factors could result in a lack of growth or decline in customer demand for electricity or number of customers and may cause the failure of the Duke Energy Registrants to fully realize anticipated benefits from significant capital investments and expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nFurthermore, the Duke Energy Registrants currently have EE riders in place to recover the cost of EE programs in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky. Should the Duke Energy Registrants be required to invest in conservation measures that result in reduced sales from effective conservation, regulatory lag in adjusting rates for the impact of these measures could have a negative financial impact.\n\n## The Duke Energy Registrants future results may be impacted by changing expectations and demands including heightened emphasis on environmental, social and governance concerns.\n\nDuke Energy's ability to execute its strategy and achieve anticipated financial outcomes are influenced by the expectations of our customers, regulators, investors, and stakeholders. Those expectations are based in part on the core fundamentals of reliability and affordability but are also increasingly focused on our ability to meet rapidly changing demands for new and varied products, services and offerings. Additionally, the risks of global climate change continues to shape our customers' sustainability goals and energy needs as well as the investment and financing criteria of investors. Failure to meet these increasing expectations or to adequately address the risks and external pressures from regulators, customers, investors and other stakeholders may impact Duke Energy's reputation and affect its ability to achieve favorable outcomes in future rate cases and the results of operations for the Duke Energy Registrants. Furthermore, the increasing use of social media may accelerate and increase the potential scope of negative publicity we might receive and could increase the negative impact on our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\nAs it relates to electric generation, a diversified fleet with increasingly clean generation resources may facilitate more efficient financing and lower costs. Conversely, jurisdictions utilizing more carbon-intensive generation such as coal may experience difficulty attracting certain investors and obtaining the most economical financing terms available. Furthermore, with this heightened emphasis on environmental, social, and governance concerns, and climate change in particular, there is an increased risk of litigation by activists.",

Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside the control of NEE and FPL, such as mandated energy efficiency measures, demand side management requirements, and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity. A lack of growth, or a decline, in the number of customers or in customer demand for electricity or natural gas and other fuels may cause NEE and FPL to fail to fully realize the anticipated benefits from significant investments and expenditures and could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's growth, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects can be materially adversely affected by weather conditions, including, but not limited to, the impact of severe weather.\n\nWeather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and other fuels and affect the price of energy and energy-related commodities. In addition, severe weather and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, droughts, extreme temperatures, icing events and earthquakes, can be destructive and cause power outages and property damage, reduce revenue, affect the availability of fuel and water, and require NEE and FPL to incur additional costs, for example, to restore service and repair damaged facilities, to obtain replacement power and to access available financing sources. Furthermore, NEE's and FPL's physical plants could be placed at greater risk of damage should changes in the global climate produce unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns, resulting in more intense, frequent and extreme weather events, abnormal levels of precipitation and, particularly relevant to FPL, a change in sea level. FPL operates in the east and lower west coasts of Florida and in northwest Florida, areas that historically have been prone to severe weather events, such as hurricanes. A disruption or failure of electric generation, transmission or distribution systems or natural gas production, transmission, storage or distribution systems in the event of a hurricane, tornado or other severe weather event, or otherwise, could prevent NEE and FPL from operating their business in the normal course and could result in any of the adverse consequences described above. Additionally, the actions taken to address the potential for severe weather such as additional winterizing of critical equipment and infrastructure, modifying or alternating plant operations and expanding load shedding options could result in significant increases in costs. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nAt FPL and other businesses of NEE where cost recovery is available, recovery of costs to restore service, to repair damaged facilities or for other actions to address severe weather is or may be subject to regulatory approval, and any determination by the regulator not to permit timely and  full  recovery  of  the  costs  incurred  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  NEE's  and  FPL's  business,  financial  condition,  results  of operations and prospects.",

The loss recognized on sales of receivables is calculated monthly by multiplying receivables sold during the month by the required discount. The required discount is derived monthly utilizing a three-year weighted average formula that considers charge-off history, late charge history and turnover history on the sold receivables, as well as a component for the time value of money. The discount rate, or component for the time value of money, is the prior month-end LIBOR plus a fixed rate of 1%.\n\n## 18. REVENUE\n\nDuke Energy recognizes revenue consistent with amounts billed under tariff offerings or at contractually agreed upon rates based on actual physical delivery of electric or natural gas service, including estimated volumes delivered when billings have not yet occurred. As such, the majority of Duke Energy's revenues have fixed pricing based on the contractual terms of the published tariffs, with variability in expected cash flows attributable to the customer's volumetric demand and ultimate quantities of energy or natural gas supplied and used during the billing period. The stand-alone selling price of related sales are designed to support recovery of prudently incurred costs and an appropriate return on invested assets and are primarily governed by published tariff rates or contractual agreements approved by relevant regulatory bodies. As described in Note 1, certain excise taxes and franchise fees levied by state or local governments are required to be paid even if not collected from the customer. These taxes are recognized on a gross basis as part of revenues. Duke Energy elects to account for all other taxes net of revenues.\n\nPerformance obligations are satisfied over time as energy or natural gas is delivered and consumed with billings generally occurring monthly and related payments due within 30 days, depending on regulatory requirements. In no event does the timing between payment and delivery of the goods and services exceed one year. Using this output method for revenue recognition provides a faithful depiction of the transfer of electric and natural gas service as customers obtain control of the commodity and benefit from its use at delivery. Additionally, Duke Energy has an enforceable right to consideration for energy or natural gas delivered at any discrete point in time and will recognize revenue at an amount that reflects the consideration to which Duke Energy is entitled for the energy or natural gas delivered.\n\nAs described above, the majority of Duke Energy's tariff revenues are at-will and, as such, related contracts with customers have an expected duration of one year or less and will not have future performance obligations for disclosure. Additionally, other long-term revenue streams, including wholesale contracts, generally provide services that are part of a single performance obligation, the delivery of electricity or natural gas. As such, other than material fixed consideration under long-term contracts, related disclosures for future performance obligations are also not applicable.\n\nDuke Energy earns substantially all of its revenues through its reportable segments, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure, Gas Utilities and Infrastructure and Commercial Renewables.\n\n## Electric Utilities and Infrastructure\n\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure earns the majority of its revenues through retail and wholesale electric service through the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity. Duke Energy generally provides retail and wholesale electric service customers with their full electric load requirements or with supplemental load requirements when the customer has other sources of electricity.\n\nRetail electric service is generally marketed throughout Duke Energy's electric service territory through standard service offers. The standard service offers are through tariffs determined by regulators in Duke Energy's regulated service territory. Each tariff, which is assigned to customers based on customer class, has multiple components such as an energy charge, a demand charge, a basic facilities charge and applicable riders. Duke Energy considers each of these components to be aggregated into a single performance obligation for providing electric service, or in the case of distribution only customers in Duke Energy Ohio, for delivering electricity. Electricity is considered a single performance obligation satisfied over time consistent with the series guidance and is provided and consumed over the billing period, generally one month. Retail electric service is typically provided to at-will customers who can cancel service at any time, without a substantive penalty. Additionally, Duke Energy adheres to applicable regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction to ensure the collectability of amounts billed and appropriate mitigating procedures are followed when necessary. As such, revenue from contracts with customers for such contracts is equivalent to the electricity supplied and billed in that period (including unbilled estimates).\n\nWholesale electric service is generally provided under long-term contracts using cost-based pricing. FERC regulates costs that may be recovered from customers and the amount of return companies are permitted to earn. Wholesale contracts include both energy and demand charges. For full requirements contracts, Duke Energy considers both charges as a single performance obligation for providing integrated electric service. For contracts where energy and demand charges are considered separate performance obligations, energy and demand are each a distinct performance obligation under the series guidance and are satisfied as energy is delivered and stand-ready service is provided on a monthly basis. This service represents consumption over the billing period and revenue is recognized consistent with billings and unbilled estimates, which generally occur monthly. Contractual amounts owed are typically trued up annually based upon incurred costs in accordance with FERC published filings and the specific customer's actual peak demand. Estimates of variable consideration related to potential additional billings or refunds owed are updated quarterly.",

At  December  31, 2021, NEE's AOCI included amounts related to discontinued interest rate cash flow hedges with expiration dates through March 2035 and foreign currency  cash  flow  hedges  with  expiration  dates  through  September  2030.  Approximately  $6  million  of  net  losses  included  in  AOCI  at December 31, 2021 are expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months as the principal and/or interest payments are made. Such amounts assume no change in scheduled principal payments.\n\nFair Value Measurements of Derivative Instruments - The fair value of assets and liabilities are determined using either unadjusted quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) or pricing inputs that are observable (Level 2) whenever that information is available and using unobservable inputs (Level 3) to estimate fair value only when relevant observable inputs are not available. NEE and FPL use several different valuation techniques to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities, relying primarily on the market approach of using prices and other market information for identical and/or comparable assets and liabilities for those assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. NEE's and FPL's assessment of the significance of any particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect placement within the fair value hierarchy levels. Non-performance risk, including the consideration of a credit valuation adjustment, is also considered in the determination of fair value for all assets and liabilities measured at fair value.\n\nNEE and FPL measure the fair value of commodity contracts using a combination of market and income approaches utilizing prices observed on commodities exchanges and in the OTC markets, or through the use of industry-standard valuation  techniques,  such  as  option  modeling  or discounted cash flows techniques, incorporating both observable and unobservable valuation inputs. The resulting measurements are the best estimate of fair value as represented by the transfer of the asset or liability through an orderly transaction in the marketplace at the measurement date.\n\nMost exchange-traded derivative assets and liabilities are valued directly using unadjusted quoted prices. For exchange-traded derivative assets and  liabilities  where  the  principal  market  is  deemed  to  be  inactive  based  on  average  daily  volumes  and  open  interest,  the  measurement  is established using settlement prices from the exchanges, and therefore considered to be valued using other observable inputs.\n\nNEE, through its subsidiaries, including FPL, also enters into OTC commodity contract derivatives. The majority of these contracts are transacted at liquid trading points, and the prices for these contracts are verified using quoted prices in active markets from exchanges, brokers or pricing services for similar contracts.\n\nNEE, through NEER, also enters into full requirements contracts, which, in most cases, meet the definition of derivatives and are measured at fair value. These contracts typically have one or more inputs that are not observable and are significant to the valuation of the contract. In addition, certain exchange and non-exchange traded derivative options at NEE have one or more significant inputs that are not observable, and are valued using industry-standard option models.\n\nIn  all  cases  where  NEE and FPL use significant unobservable inputs for the valuation of a commodity contract, consideration is given to the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. The primary input to the valuation models for commodity contracts is the forward commodity curve for the respective instruments. Other inputs include, but are not limited to, assumptions about market liquidity, volatility,  correlation  and  contract  duration  as  more  fully  described  below  in  Significant  Unobservable  Inputs  Used  in  Recurring  Fair  Value Measurements. In  instances  where  the  reference  markets  are  deemed  to  be  inactive  or  do  not  have  transactions  for  a  similar  contract,  the derivative assets and liabilities may be valued using significant other observable inputs and potentially significant unobservable inputs. In such instances, the valuation for these contracts is established using techniques including extrapolation from or interpolation between actively traded contracts, or estimated basis adjustments from liquid trading points. NEE and FPL regularly evaluate and validate the inputs used to determine fair value by a number of methods, consisting of various market price verification procedures, including the use of pricing services and multiple broker quotes to support the market price of the various commodities. In all cases where there are assumptions and models used to generate inputs  for  valuing  derivative  assets  and  liabilities,  the  review  and  verification  of  the  assumptions,  models  and  changes  to  the  models  are undertaken by individuals that are independent of those responsible for estimating fair value.\n\nNEE uses interest rate contracts and foreign currency contracts to mitigate and adjust interest rate and foreign currency exchange exposure related  primarily  to  certain  outstanding  and  expected  future  debt  issuances  and  borrowings  when  deemed  appropriate  based  on  market conditions or when required by financing agreements. NEE estimates the fair value of these derivatives using an income approach based on a discounted cash flows valuation technique utilizing the net amount of estimated future cash inflows and outflows related to the agreements.\n\nThe tables below present NEE's and FPL's gross derivative positions at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, as required by disclosure rules. However, the majority of the underlying contracts are subject to master netting agreements and generally would not be contractually settled on a gross basis. Therefore, the tables below also present the derivative positions on a net basis, which reflect the offsetting of positions of certain transactions within the portfolio, the contractual ability to settle contracts under master netting arrangements and the netting of margin cash collateral, as well as the location of the net derivative position on the consolidated balance sheets.",

T he consolidated financial statem ents, which in part are based on inform ed judgm ents and estim ates m ade by m anagem ent, have been prepared in conform ity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis.\n\nT o aid in carrying out this responsibility, we, along with all other m em bers of m anagem ent, m aintain a system  of internal accounting control which is established after weighing the cost of such controls against the benefits derived. I n the opinion of m anagem ent, the overall system  of internal accounting control provides reasonable assurance that the assets of NEE  and FP L and their subsidiaries are safeguarded and that transactions are executed in accordance with m anagem ent's authorization and are properly recorded for the preparation of financial statem ents. I n addition, m anagem ent believes the overall system  of internal accounting control provides reasonable assurance that m aterial errors or irregularities would be prevented or detected on a tim ely basis by em ployees in the norm al course of their duties. Any system  of internal accounting control, no m atter how well designed, has inherent lim itations, including the possibility that controls can be circum vented or overridden and m isstatem ents due to error or fraud m ay occur and not be detected. Also, because of changes in conditions, internal control effectiveness m ay vary over tim e. Accordingly, even an effective system  of internal control will provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statem ent preparation and reporting.\n\nThe system  of internal accounting control is supported by written policies and guidelines, the selection and training of qualified em ployees, an organizational structure that provides an appropriate division of responsibility and a program  of internal auditing. N E E 's written policies include a C ode of Business C onduct &amp; E thics that states m anagem ent's policy on conflicts of interest and ethical conduct. C om pliance with the C ode of Business C onduct &amp; E thics is confirm ed annually by key personnel.\n\nThe  Board  of  D irectors  pursues  its  oversight  responsibility  for  financial  reporting  and  accounting  through  its Audit  C om m ittee.

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## Natural Gas\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from natural gas facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated generating unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serve the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable.\n\nAs a general matter, substantially all of the PPAs provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel or purchased power relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs. To the extent a particular generating facility does not meet the operational requirements contemplated in the PPAs, Southern Power may be responsible for excess fuel costs. With respect to fuel transportation risk, most of Southern Power's PPAs provide that the counterparties are responsible for the availability of fuel transportation to the particular generating facility.\n\nCapacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year. In general, to reduce Southern Power's exposure to certain operation and maintenance costs, Southern Power has LTSAs. See Note 1 to the financial statements under \"Long-Term Service Agreements\" for additional information.\n\n## Solar and Wind\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however, these PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fixed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fix ed and variable operations and maintenance ex penses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the associated renewable energy credits.\n\n## Income Tax Matters\n\n## Consolidated Income Taxes\n\nThe impact of certain tax events at Southern Company and/or its other subsidiaries can, and does, affect each Registrant's ability to utilize certain tax  credits. See \"Tax Credits\" and ACCOUNTING POLICIES - \"Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Accounting for Income Taxes\" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Tax Credits\n\nSouthern Company receives ITCs and PTCs in connection with investments in solar, wind, fuel cell, advanced nuclear, hydroelectric, and battery energy storage facilities primarily at Southern Power, G eorgia Power, and Alabama Power.\n\nSouthern Power's ITCs relate to its investment in new solar facilities and battery energy storage facilities (co-located with ex isting solar facilities) that are acquired or constructed and its PTCs relate to the first 10 years of energy production from its wind and solar facilities, which have had, and may continue to have, a material impact on Southern Power's cash flows and net income. At December 31, 2024, Southern Company and Southern Power had approximately $765 million and $384 million, respectively, of unutilized federal ITCs and PTCs, which are currently projected to be fully utilized by 2028 but could be further delayed. Since 2018, Southern Power has utilized tax equity partnerships for certain wind, solar, and battery energy storage projects, where the tax  equity partner takes significantly all of the respective federal tax  benefits. These tax  equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Company's and Southern Power's financial statements using the HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses.\n\nIn the third quarter 2023 and the second quarter 2024, Georgia Power started generating advanced nuclear PTCs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, respectively, beginning on each unit's respective in-service date. PTCs are recognized as an income tax benefit based on KWH production. In addition, pursuant to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements (as defined in Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction - Cost and Schedule\"), Georgia Power is purchasing advanced nuclear PTCs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 from the other Vogtle Owners. The gain recognized on the purchase of the joint owner PTCs is recognized as an income tax benefit. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" for additional information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.",

A t December 31, 2024 and 2023, the assets and liabilities of these V IEs consisted primarily of property , plant and equipment and accounts payable.\n\nOther - A t December 31, 2024 and 2023, several NEE subsidiaries had investments totaling approximately $5,848 million ($4,506 million at FPL) and $4,962 million ($3,899 million at FPL), respectively , which are included in special use funds and noncurrent other assets on NEE's consolidated balance sheets and in special use funds on FPL's consolidated balance sheets. These investments represented primarily commingled funds and asset-backed securities. NEE subsidiaries, including FPL, are not the primary beneficiaries and therefore do not consolidate any of these entities because they do not control any of the ongoing activities of these entities, were not inv olv ed in the initial design of these entities and do not hav e a controlling financial interest in these entities.\n\nCertain subsidiaries of NEE have noncontrolling interests in entities accounted for under the equity method, including NEE's noncontrolling interest in X PLR OpCo (see Note 8). These entities are limited partnerships or similar entity structures in which the limited partners or non-managing members do not have substantive rights over the significant activities of these entities, and therefore are considered V IEs. NEE is not the primary beneficiary because it does not have a controlling financial interest in these entities, and therefore does not consolidate any of these entities. NEE's investment in these entities totaled approximately $3,315 million and $3,913 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively . A t December 31, 2024, subsidiaries of NEE had guarantees related to certain obligations of one of these entities, as well as commitments to invest an additional approximately $175 million in several of these entities. See further discussion of such guarantees and commitments in Note 15 - Commitments and - Contracts, respectively.\n\n## 10. Leases\n\nNEE has operating and finance leases primarily related to land use agreements that convey exclusive use of the land during the arrangement for certain of its renewable energy projects and substations, as well as buildings and equipment. Operating and finance leases primarily have fixed payments with expected expiration dates ranging from 2025 to 2083, with the exception of operating leases related to three land use agreements with an expiration date of 2106, some of which include options to extend the leases up to 34 years and some have options to terminate at NEE's discretion. A t December 31, 2024, NEE's ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases totaled approximately $372 million and $387 million, respectively; the respective amounts at December 31, 2023 were $396 million and $412 million. A t December 31, 2024, NEE's ROU assets and lease liabilities for finance leases totaled approximately $826 million and $840 million, respectively; the respective amounts at December 31, 2023 were $440 million and $444 million. NEE's lease liabilities at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were calculated using a weighted-average incremental borrowing rate at the lease inception of 3.83% and 3.96%, respectively , for operating leases and 4.92% and 4.32%, respectively , for finance leases, and a weighted-average remaining lease term of 44 years and 44 years, respectively , for operating leases and 33 years and 32 years, respectively , for finance leases. A t December 31, 2024, expected lease payments over the remaining terms of the leases were approximately $2.6 billion with no one year being material. Operating and finance lease-related amounts were not material to NEE's consolidated statements of income or cash flows for the periods presented.\n\nNEE has operating and sales-type leases primarily related to certain battery storage facilities and a natural gas and oil electric generation facility that sell their electric output under power sales agreements to third parties which provide the customers the ability to dispatch the facilities. A t December 31, 2024, the power sales agreements have expiration dates from 2026 to 2044 and NEE expects to receive approximately $3.9 billion of lease payments over the remaining terms of the  power  sales  agreements  with  no  one  year  being  material.  Operating  and  sales-type  lease-related  amounts  were  not  material  to  NEE's  consolidated statements of income or balance sheets for the periods presented.\n\n## 11. Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nNEE's AROs relate primarily to decommissioning obligations of FPL's and NEER's nuclear units and to obligations for the dismantlement of certain of NEER's wind and solar facilities. For NEE's rate-regulated operations, including FPL, the accounting provisions result in timing differences in the recognition of legal asset  retirement  costs  for  financial  reporting  purposes  and  the  method  the  regulator  allows  for  recovery  in  rates.

A significant com petitive factor is price. G U &amp;I 's prim ary product com petition is with electricity for space heating, water heating and cooking. Increases in the price of natural gas or decreases in the price of other energy sources could negatively im pact com petitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consum er. In the case of industrial custom ers, such as manufacturing plants, adverse econom ic or m arket conditions, including higher natural gas costs, could cause these custom ers to suspend business operations or to use alternative sources of energy in favor of energy sources with lower per-unit costs.\n\nHigher natural gas costs or decreases in the price of other energy sources m ay allow com petition from  alternative energy sources for applications that have traditionally used natural gas, encouraging som e custom ers to m ove away from  natural gas-fired equipm ent to equipm ent fueled by other energy sources. C om petition between natural gas and other form s of energy is also based on efficiency, perform ance, reliability, safety and other non-price factors. T echnological im provem ents in other energy sources and events that im pair the public perception of the non-price attributes of natural gas could erode G U &amp;I's com petitive advantage. T hese factors in turn could decrease the dem and for natural gas, im pair G U &amp;I's ability to attract new custom ers and cause existing custom ers to switch to other form s of energy or to bypass G U &amp;I's system s in favor of alternative com petitive sources. T his could result in slow or no custom er growth for G U &amp;I and could cause custom ers to reduce or cease using natural gas, thereby reducing G U &amp;I's ability to m ake capital expenditures and otherwise grow its business, adversely affecting its earnings.\n\n## Natural Gas Investments\n\nDuke E nergy, through its G U &amp;I segm ent, has a 7.5% equity ownership interest in Sabal T rail. Sabal T rail is a joint venture that owns the Sabal T rail N atural G as P ipeline, which is regulated by FE R C  and traverses Alabam a, G eorgia, and F lorida to transport natural gas to F lorida. D uke E nergy, also through its G U &amp;I segm ent, has a 47% equity ownership interest in AC P  and investm ents in various renewable natural gas joint ventures.

T he state utility com m issions, to varying degrees, have authority over the construction and operation of G U &amp;I's natural gas distribution facilities. C P C N s issued by the state utility com m issions or other governm ent agencies, as applicable, authorize GU&amp;I to construct and operate its natural gas distribution facilities and to sell natural gas to retail and wholesale custom ers. P rior approval from  the relevant state utility com m ission is required for G U &amp;I to issue securities. T he underlying concept of utility ratem aking is to set rates at a level that allows the utility to collect revenues equal to its cost of providing service plus a reasonable rate of return on its invested capital, including equity.\n\nI n addition to am ounts collected from  custom ers through approved base rates, each of the state utility com m issions allow recovery of certain costs through various cost recovery clauses to the extent the respective com m ission determ ines in periodic hearings that such costs, including any past over- or under-recovered costs, are prudent.\n\nNatural gas costs are eligible for recovery by G U &amp;I. D ue to the associated regulatory treatm ent and the m ethod allowed for recovery, changes in natural gas costs from  year to year have no m aterial im pact on operating results of G U &amp;I, unless a com m ission finds a portion of such costs to have been im prudent. H owever, delays between the expenditure for natural gas and recovery from  custom ers can adversely im pact the tim ing of cash flows of G U &amp;I.

In contrast, FPL, a subsidiary of NextEra Energy (NEE), is regulated by the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC), which determines rates based on FPL's costs and investment in utility assets. FPL's audit required evaluating both regulatory assets and liabilities, particularly concerning storm restoration costs and future rate reductions, with procedures focused on FPSC precedents and regulatory orders affecting future cash flows.

In our opinion, the financial statem ents present fairly, in all m aterial respects, the financial position of the C om pany as of D ecem ber 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended D ecem ber 31, 2024, in conform ity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U nited States of Am erica.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statem ents are the responsibility of the C om pany's m anagem ent. O ur responsibility is to express an opinion on the C om pany's financial statem ents based on our audits. W e are a public accounting firm  registered with the P ublic C om pany Accounting O versight Board (U nited States) (P C AO B) and are required to be independent with respect to the C om pany in accordance with the U .S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and E xchange C om m ission and the P C AO B.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the P C AO B. Those standards require that we plan and perform  the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statem ents are free of m aterial m isstatem ent, whether due to error or fraud. T he C om pany is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform , an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the C om pany's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\nOur audits included perform ing procedures to assess the risks of m aterial m isstatem ent of the financial statem ents, whether due to error or fraud, and perform ing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included exam ining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the am ounts and disclosures in the financial statem ents. O ur audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estim ates m ade by m anagem ent, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statem ents. W e believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit m atter com m unicated below is a m atter arising from  the current-period audit of the financial statem ents that was com m unicated or required to be com m unicated to the audit com m ittee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are m aterial to the financial statem ents and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or com plex judgm ents. T he com m unication of critical audit m atters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statem ents, taken as a whole, and we are not, by com m unicating the critical audit m atter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit m atter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\nRegulatory Matters - Impact of R ate R egulation on the Financial Statements - R efer to N otes 1 and 4 to the financial statements.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Com pany is subject to rate regulation by the P ublic U tilities C om m ission of O hio and by the Kentucky P ublic Service C om m ission (collectively the 'C om m issions'), which have jurisdiction with respect to the electric and gas rates of the C om pany. M anagem ent has determ ined it m eets the criteria for the application of regulated operations accounting in preparing its financial statem ents under accounting principles generally accepted in the U nited States of Am erica. Judgm ent can be required to determ ine if otherwise recognizable incurred costs qualify to be presented as a regulatory asset and deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in custom er rates.\n\nWe identified the im pact of rate regulation related to regulatory assets as a critical audit m atter due to the judgm ents m ade by m anagem ent, including assum ptions regarding the outcom e of future decisions by the C om m issions to support its assertions on the likelihood of future recovery for deferred costs. G iven that m anagem ent's accounting judgm ents are based on assum ptions about the outcom e of future decisions by the C om m issions, auditing these judgm ents required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the ratem aking process due to its inherent com plexities as it relates to regulatory assets.\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the recovery of regulatory assets included the following, am ong others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of m anagem ent's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of the recovery in future rates and the m onitoring and evaluation of regulatory developm ents that m ay affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates.\n- We evaluated the C om pany's disclosures related to the im pacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developm ents.\n- We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the C om m issions and other publicly available inform ation to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates based on precedents of the C om m issions' treatm ent of sim ilar costs under sim ilar circum stances.

For certain fair value models, we used our firm specialists to directly  test the underly ing assumptions of the unobservable inputs used by management.\n- We evaluated NEE's disclosures related to the proprietary models and unobservable inputs to estimate the fair value of Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities, including the balances recorded and significant assumptions.\n\n## FPL -Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit M atter Description\n\nFPL is subject to rate  regulation  by  the  Florida  Public  Service  Commission  (the  'FPSC'),  which  has  jurisdiction  with  respect  to  the  rates  of  electric  utility companies. M anagement has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of A merica to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. A ccounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, such as property , plant, and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; operating revenues; fuel expense; operation and maintenance expense; and depreciation expense.\n\nRates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of FPL's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, FPL's investment in the assets required to deliver utility service. A ccounting guidance for FPL's regulated operations provides that rate-regulated entities report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates, if it is probable that such rates will be charged and collected. The FPSC has the authority to disallow recovery of costs that it considers excessive or imprudently incurred. Future FPSC decisions could impact the accounting for regulated operations, including decisions about the amount of recoverable costs and any refunds that may be required. A s a result of this cost-based regulation, FPL follows the accounting guidance that allows regulators to create assets and impose liabilities, based on the probability of future cash flows, that would not be recorded by non-rate regulated entities. Regulatory assets and liabilities represent probable future revenues that will be recovered from or refunded to customers through the ratemaking process.\n\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the requirement to have auditors with deep knowledge of and significant experience with accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities.\n\n## How the Critical Audit M atter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the impact of rate regulation included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property , plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property , plant, and equipment and regulatory assets or liabilities, including storm restoration costs; the depreciation and amortization of such amounts in accordance with FPSC orders; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs recognized as property , plant and equipment and regulatory assets in future rates or of a refund or future reduction in rates that should be recognized as a regulatory liability.\n- We assessed the likelihood of (1) recovery of recorded regulatory assets and (2) obligations requiring future reductions in rates by obtaining, reading, and  evaluating  relevant  regulatory  orders  issued  by  the  FPSC  to  FPL,  and  considering  regulatory  precedents  established  by  the  FPSC.  W e  also evaluated such regulatory orders and other publicly available filings made by FPL and compared them to management's recorded regulatory asset and liability  balances for completeness.\n- We evaluated FPL's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.\n\n## DELOITTE &amp; TOUCHE LLP\n\nBoca Raton, Florida February 14, 2025\n\nWe have served as NEE's and FPL's auditor since 1950.",

FPL recognizes ITCs as a reduction to income tax expense over the depreciable life of the related energy property . A t December 31, 2024 and 2023, FPL's accumulated deferred ITCs were approximately $966 million and $997 million, respectively , and are included in noncurrent regulatory liabilities on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. For taxable years beginning after 2022, renewable energy tax credits generated during the taxable  year  can  be  transferred  to  an  unrelated  purchaser  for  cash  and  are  accounted  for  under Accounting  Standards  Codification  740 -Income  T axes . Proceeds resulting from the sales of renewable energy tax credits for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 of approximately $1,304 million and $370 million, respectively , are reported in the cash paid (received) for income taxes - net within the supplemental disclosures of cash flow information on NEE's consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nA valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. NEE recognizes interest income (expense) related to unrecognized tax benefits (liabilities) in interest income and interest expense, respectively , net of the amount deferred at FPL. A t FPL, the offset to accrued interest receivable (payable) on income taxes is classified as a regulatory liability (regulatory asset) which will be amortized to income (expense) over a five-year period upon settlement in accordance with regulatory treatment. A ll tax positions taken by NEE in its income tax returns that are recognized in the financial statements must satisfy a more-likely-than-not threshold. NEE and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various states, the most significant of which is Florida, and certain foreign jurisdictions. Federal tax liabilities, with the exception of certain refund claims, are effectively settled for all years prior to 2019. State and foreign tax liabilities, which have varied statutes of limitations regarding additional assessments, are generally effectively settled for years prior to 2019. A t December 31, 2024, NEE had unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $130 million that, if recogniz ed, could impact the annual effective income tax rate. The amounts of unrecognized tax benefits and related interest accruals may change within the next 12 months; however, NEE and FPL do not expect these changes to have a significant impact on NEE's or FPL's financial statements. See Note 5.\n\nNoncontrolling Interests - Noncontrolling interests represent the portions of net assets in consolidated entities that are not owned by NEE and are reported as a component of equity on NEE's consolidated balance sheets. A t December 31, 2024, noncontrolling interests on NEE's consolidated balance sheets primarily reflects the interests related to differential membership interests discussed below, as well as other noncontrolling interests in certain wind and solar generation and transmission facilities sold to non-affiliated parties and X PLR Infrastructure Partners, LP (X PLR) (formerly NextEra Energy Partners, LP).\n\nCertain subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources have sold Class B noncontrolling membership interests in entities that have ownership interests in wind generation, solar generation and battery storage facilities, with generating/storage capacity in operation or under construction totaling approximately 11,258 M W, 4,084 MW and 1,919 MW, respectively , at December 31, 2024, to third-party investors (differential membership interests). The third-party investors are allocated earnings, tax attributes and cash flows in accordance with the respective limited liability company agreements. Those economics are allocated primarily to the third-party inv estors until they  receiv e a targeted return (the flip date) and thereafter to NEE. NEE has the right to call the third-party  interests at specified amounts if and when the flip date occurs. NEE has determined the allocation of economics between the controlling party and third-party investor should not follow the respective ownership percentages for each wind generation, solar generation and battery storage project but rather the hypothetical liquidation of book value (HLBV) method based on the governing provisions in each respective limited liability company agreement. Under the HLBV  method, the amounts of income and loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest reflects changes in the amount the owners would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the respective liquidation provisions, assuming the net assets of these entities were liquidated at the recorded amounts, after taking into account any capital transactions, such as contributions and distributions, between the entities and the owners. A t the point in time that the third-party investor, in hypothetical liquidation, would achieve its targeted return, NEE attributes the additional hypothetical proceeds to the differential membership interests based on the call price. A loss attributable to noncontrolling interests on NEE's consolidated statements of income represents earnings attributable to NEE.\n\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately $9,062 million and $8,857 million, respectively , of noncontrolling interests on NEE's consolidated balance sheets relates to differential membership interests. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, NEE recorded earnings of approximately $1,329 million, $1,135 million and $987 million, respectively , associated with differential membership interests, which is reflected as net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests on NEE's consolidated statements of income.\n\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests - Certain subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources sold Class B noncontrolling membership interests in entities that have ownership interests in wind generation, as well as solar and solar plus battery storage facilities to third-party investors. A s specified in the respective limited liability  company agreements, if, subject to certain contingencies, certain events occur, including, among others, those that would delay completion or cancel any of the underlying projects, an investor has the option to require NEER to return all or part of its investment. A s these potential redemptions were outside of NEER's control, these balances were classified as redeemable noncontrolling interests on NEE's consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
