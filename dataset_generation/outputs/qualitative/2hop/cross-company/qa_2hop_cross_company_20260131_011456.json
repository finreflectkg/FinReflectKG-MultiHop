      "question": "How does the reliance on third-party distributors by both Philip Morris (PM) and Target (TGT) expose them to different types of operational risks, and what specific facilities or services are most vulnerable in each company's supply chain?",
      "answer": "Philip Morris (PM) relies on third-party distributors and subcontractors, particularly concentrated in specific geographic areas, for the distribution of products like ZYN, which is manufactured in a single facility in Kentucky that supplies nearly all U.S. ZYN sales. A disruption at this facility or with its third-party logistics partners could significantly impact product availability and market share. In contrast, Target (TGT) depends on third-party distributors and common carriers for delivering merchandise sold through digital channels, including same-day delivery via its subsidiary Shipt. A disruption in these third-party logistics networks could delay fulfillment, increase shipping costs, and reduce product availability for online orders. Thus, PM faces risks around product availability and quality due to limited control over third-party logistics, while TGT faces risks related to fulfillment speed and cost efficiency.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, PM relies on third-party distributors and subcontractors, especially for ZYN, which is produced almost entirely at a facility in Kentucky. A disruption could significantly impact U.S. sales.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, TGT uses third-party distributors and common carriers for digital channel fulfillment, including same-day delivery through Shipt. Disruptions could increase costs and reduce delivery speed.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize that while both companies depend on third-party distributors, the nature and impact of the risks differ\u2014PM faces risks to product availability and quality, while TGT faces risks to fulfillment speed, cost, and digital sales performance."

          "chunk_text": "## Risks Related to Sourcing and Distribution of Products, Services and Materials\n\n## Use of third-parties may negatively impact the distribution, quality, and availability of our products and services, and we may be required to replace third-party contract distributors, manufacturers or service providers.\n\nWe increasingly rely on third-parties  and  their  subcontractors/suppliers,  sometimes  concentrated  in  a  specific  geographic  area,  for  product  distribution  and  to manufacture some of our products and product parts (particularly, the electronic devices and accessories), as well as to provide services, including to support our finance, commercialization and information technology processes. While many of these arrangements improve efficiencies and decrease our operating costs, they also diminish our direct control. Such diminished control may lead to disruption in the distribution of our products and may have a material adverse effect on the quality and availability of products or services, our supply chain, and the speed and flexibility in our response to changing market conditions and adult consumer preferences, all of which may place us at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, we may be unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms for numerous reasons, including government regulations, and the distribution of our products may be disrupted in certain markets or our costs may increase significantly if we must replace such third parties with other partners or our own resources.\n\n## The effects of climate change, other environmental issues, and related legal or regulatory responses may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\n\nWhile we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with environmental issues, such as climate change, by establishing environmental goals and standards and seeking business partners, including within our supply chain, that are committed to operating in ways that protect the environment or mitigate environmental impacts, we recognize that there are inherent environmental-related risks, including climate change-related risks, wherever business is conducted. Among other potential impacts, climate change could influence the quality and volume of the agricultural products we rely on, including tobacco, due to several factors beyond our control, including  more  frequent  variations  in  weather  patterns,  ex treme  weather  events  causing  unex pected  downtime  and  inventory  losses,  other  adverse  weather conditions, and governmental restrictions on trade, all of which may lead to disruption of operations at factories, warehouses and other premises.\n\nFurthermore, nature-related risks, including those related to natural ecosystems degradation, decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world, biodiversity loss, water resource depletion and deforestation, which are partially driven or exacerbated by climate change, may negatively impact the resilience of, or otherwise disrupt, our business operations or those of our suppliers and business partners.\n\nThere is an increased focus by foreign, federal, state and local regulatory and legislative bodies on environmental policies, including those relating to climate change. New environmental-related legal or regulatory requirements may lead to additional carbon taxation, raw or other materials taxation, energy price increases, new compliance  costs,  increased  distribution  and  supply  chain  costs,  and  other  ex penses  impacting  our  cost  of  operations.  Moreover,  given  that  the  regulatory framework in this regard is highly dynamic, additional uncertainties may be driven by further upcoming regulatory changes on which we might have limited visibility or limited time to implement, which could have an impact on several elements of our business, including elevating the cost or complexity of our operations. Even if we make changes to align ourselves with legal or regulatory requirements, we may still be subject to significant penalties if such laws or regulations are interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent with our practices. Additionally, government authorities, non-governmental organizations or external stakeholders are increasingly filing lawsuits or initiating regulatory actions, alleging that public statements regarding sustainability-related matters and practices are misleading or false.\n\n## Government mandated prices, production control programs, and shifts in crops driven by economic conditions may increase the cost or reduce the quality of the tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our products.\n\nAs with other agricultural commodities, the price of tobacco leaf and cloves can be influenced by imbalances in supply and demand and the impacts of natural disasters and pandemics such as COVID-19. Tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls, including government mandated prices and production control programs. Changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products could cause farmers to produce less tobacco or cloves. Any significant change in tobacco leaf and clove prices, quality and quantity could affect our profitability and our business.\n\n## A prolonged disruption of our production facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nA prolonged disruption at or shut-down of one or more of the facilities where our products are produced, especially our ZYN production facility in Kentucky, U.S., which currently supplies substantially all of our capacity for ZYN sales in the U.S., due to natural- or man-made disasters or other events outside of our control, such as equipment malfunction or widespread outbreaks of acute illness, including COVID-19, supply chain constraints, or for any other reason, could limit our capacity to meet customer demands. Such an event could disrupt our operations; delay production, shipments and revenue; and result in significant expense to repair or replace our affected facilities. As a result, we could forgo revenue opportunities and potentially lose market share, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.",

          "chunk_text": "## Note 2.\n\n## Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nPMI  uses  the  acquisition  method  of  accounting  for  acquired  businesses. Under  the  acquisition  method,  PMI's  consolidated  financial  statements  reflect  the operations of an acquired business starting from the closing date of the acquisition. PMI allocates the purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair value during a period of time not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date. Contingent consideration liabilities are recognized at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are recognized in marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statement of earnings. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nIf  PMI determines that assets acquired do not meet the definition of a business, the transaction will be accounted for as an acquisition of assets rather than a business  combination  and,  therefore,  no  goodwill  will  be  recorded. In  an  asset  acquisition,  acquired  in-process  research  and  development  (\"IPR&amp;D\")  with  no alternative future use is charged to ex pense.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciated primarily using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Machinery and equipment are depreciated primarily over periods ranging from 3 to 15 years, and buildings and building improvements primarily over periods up to 40 years.\n\nDefinite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives. For further details, see Note 5. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net .\n\n## Employee benefit plans\n\nPMI provides a range of benefits to its employees and retired employees, including pensions, postretirement health care and postemployment benefits (primarily severance). PMI records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified under U.S. GAAP. PMI recognizes the funded status of its defined pension and postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheets. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plans assets and the  benefit  obligation. PMI measures the plan assets and liabilities at the end of the fiscal year. For defined benefit pension plans, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation. For the postretirement health care plans, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. Any plan with an overfunded status is recognized as an asset, and any plan with an underfunded status is recognized as a liability. Any gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as a component of net periodic benefit costs are recorded as a component of other comprehensive earnings (losses), net of deferred taxes. PMI elects to recognize actuarial gains/(losses) using the corridor approach.\n\n## Fair value measurements\n\nPMI follows ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. The guidance defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The guidance describes three levels of input that may be used to measure fair value. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets  or  liabilities;  quoted  prices  in  markets  that  are  not  active;  or  other  inputs  that  are  observable  or  can  be  corroborated  by  observable  market  data  for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 are unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair  value  of  the  assets  or  liabilities. Categorization  within  the  valuation  hierarchy  is  based  upon  the  lowest  level  of  input  that  is  significant  to  the  fair  value measurement.",

          "chunk_text": "## Income taxes\n\nIncome  taxes  are  provided  on  all  earnings  for  jurisdictions  outside  the  United  States. These  provisions,  as  well  as  state  and  local  income  tax   provisions,  are determined on a separate company basis, and the related assets and liabilities are recorded in PMI's consolidated balance sheets. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. PMI recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the  provision  for  income  tax es  on  the  consolidated  statements  of  earnings. PMI  recognizes  income  tax es  associated  with  G lobal  Intangible  Low-Tax ed  Income (\"GILTI\") taxes as current period expense rather than including these amounts in the measurement of deferred taxes.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The first-in, first-out and average cost methods are used to cost substantially all inventories. It is a generally recognized industry practice to classify leaf tobacco inventory as a current asset, although part of such inventory, because of the duration of the aging process, ordinarily would not be utilized within one year.\n\n## Leases\n\nPMI determines that a contract contains a lease if the contract conveys a right to control the use of the identified asset for a period of time in exchange  for consideration. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance lease expense is amortized based on production activity or the  lease  term. Lease ex pense is recorded in cost of sales or marketing, administration and research costs depending on the nature of the leased item. At lease commencement, PMI recognizes lease liabilities and the corresponding right-of-use assets (at the present value of future payments) for predominately all of its leases. The recognition of the right-of-use asset and lease liability includes renewal options when it is reasonably certain that they will be ex ercised. Certain of PMI's leases include payments that are based on changes to an index or on actual usage. These lease payments are adjusted periodically and are included within variable lease costs. PMI accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single-lease component with the exception of its vehicle leases, of which PMI accounts for the lease components separately from the nonlease components. Additionally, leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not included in the right-of-use asset or lease liability on the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n## Marketing costs\n\nPMI supports its products with advertising, adult consumer engagement and trade promotions. Such programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, rebates, instore display incentives, e-commerce, mobile and other digital platforms, adult consumer activation and promotion activities, as well as costs associated with adult consumer experience outlets and other adult consumer touchpoints and volume-based incentives. Advertising, as well as certain consumer engagement and trade activities costs, are ex pensed as incurred. Trade promotions are recorded as a reduction of revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers at the end of a period, based principally on historical utilization. For interim reporting purposes, advertising and certain consumer engagement expenses are charged to earnings based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nPMI recognizes revenue primarily through the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and smoke-free products, including heat-not-burn, vapor and oral nicotine products. The majority of PMI revenues are generated by sales through direct and indirect distribution networks with short-term payment conditions and where control is typically transferred to the customer either upon shipment or delivery of goods. PMI evaluates the transfer of control through evidence of the customer's receipt and acceptance, transfer of title, PMI's right to payment for those products and the customer's ability to direct the use of those products upon receipt.  Typically, PMI's performance obligations are satisfied and revenue is recognized either upon shipment or delivery of goods.\n\nIn certain instances, PMI facilitates shipping and handling activities after control has transferred to the customer. PMI has elected to record all shipping and handling activities as costs to fulfill a contract. The shipping and handling costs that have not been incurred at the time revenue is recognized are accrued.  PMI is a principal for majority of its arrangements and recognizes revenue at the transaction price, with the associated costs recorded in cost of sales. The transaction price is typically based on the amount billed to the customer and includes estimated variable consideration, where applicable. Such variable consideration is typically not constrained and is estimated based on the most likely amount that PMI expects to be entitled to under the terms of the contracts with customers, historical experience of discount or rebate redemption, where relevant, and the terms of any underlying discount or rebate programs, which may change from time to time as the business and product categories  evolve. For arrangements where PMI acts as an agent, the net commission earned is recognized as revenue.

We  continue  to  expand  our  portfolio  of  cakes  and  pastries  in  new  markets  and  with updated formats including Milka brownies a nd Oreo cakes .\n\nWe  also  hav e  a  dedicated  innov ation  and  v enture  hub,  SnackFutures,  specifically  tailored  to  lev erage  emerging  consumer  trends  and  growth opportunities in mindful snacking.

Some competitors have different profit objectiv es and inv estment time horizons than we do and therefore may approach pricing and promotional decisions differently.  We compete based on product quality, brand recognition and loyalty, serv ice, product innov ation, taste, conv enience, nutritional v alue, the ability  to  identify  and  satisfy  consumer  preferences,  effectiv eness  of  our  digital  and  other  sales  and  marketing  strategies,  routes  to  market  and distribution  networks,  promotional  activ ities  and  price.

We use non-GAAP financial measures to budget, make operating and strategic decisions and ev aluate our performance. We hav e detailed the non-GAAP adjustments that we make in our non-GAAP definitions below . The adjustments generally fall within the following categories: acquisition and div estiture activ ities, gains and losses on intangible asset sales and non-cash impairments, major program restructuring activ ities, constant currency and related adjustments, major program financing and hedging activ ities and other major items affecting comparability of operating  results.  We  believ e  the  nonGAAP measures should always be considered along with the related U.S. GAAP financial measures. We hav e prov ided the reconciliations between the GAAP  and  non-GAAP  financial  measures  along  with  a  discussion  of  our  underlying  GAAP  results  throughout  our Management's  Discussion  and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K.\n\nOur primary non-GAAP financial measures are listed below and reflect how we ev aluate our current and prior year operating results. As new ev ents or circumstances arise, these definitions could change. When our definitions change, we prov ide the updated definitions and present the related non-GAAP historical results on a comparable basis . (1)\n\n- 'Organic Net Rev enue' is defined as net rev enues (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) excluding the impacts of acquisitions, div estitures , short-term distributor agreements related to the sale of a business , and currency rate fluctuations .

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law.\n\n## PART I\n\n## Item 1-Business\n\nCostco  Wholesale  Corporation  and  its  subsidiaries  (Costco  or  the  Company)  began  operations  in  1983,  in  Seattle,  Washington.  We  are  principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the United States (U.S.) and Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, Japan, the United Kingdom (U.K.), Korea, Australia,  T aiwan,  China,  Spain,  France,  Iceland,  New  Z ealand,  and  Sweden.  Costco  operated  890,  861,  and  838  warehouses  worldwide  at September 1, 2024, September 3, 2023, and August 28, 2022. The Company operates e-commerce sites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, under the symbol 'COST.'\n\nWe report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first three quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (fiv e weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). T he material seasonal impact in our operations is increased net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. References to 2024 and 2022 relate to the 52week fiscal years ended September 1, 2024, and August 28, 2022. References to 2023 relate to the 53-week fiscal year ended September 3, 2023.\n\n## General\n\nWe operate  membership  warehouses  and  e-commerce  sites  based  on  the  concept  that  offering  our  members  low  prices  on  a  limited  selection  of nationally-branded and priv ate-label products in a wide range of categories will produce high sales v olumes and rapid inv entory turnov er. When combined with  the  operating  efficiencies  achiev ed  by  v olume  purchasing,  efficient  distribution  and  reduced  handling  of  merchandise  in  no-frills,  self-serv ice warehouse facilities, these v olumes and turnov er enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We often sell inv entory before we are required to pay for it, ev en while taking adv antage of early payment discounts.\n\nWe buy most of our merchandise directly from suppliers and route it to cross-docking consolidation points (depots) or directly to our warehouses. Our depots  receiv e  large  shipments  from  suppliers  and  quickly  ship  these  goods  to  warehouses.  T his  process  creates  freight  v olume  and  handling efficiencies,  lowering  costs  associated  with  traditional  multiple-step  distribution  channels.  Our  e-commerce  operations  ship  merchandise through our depots and logistics operations, as well as through drop-ship and other deliv ery arrangements with our suppliers.",

Pet Nutrition products are sold by authorized pet supply retailers, veterinarians and eCommerce retailers. Certain of our products are also sold direct-to-consumer. Our sales to Walmart, Inc. and its affiliates represented approximately 11% of our Net sales in 2024. No other customer represented more than 10% of our Net sales in 2024. We support our products with advertising, promotion and other marketing (with increasing emphasis on digital) to build awareness and trial of our products. Our products are marketed by a direct sales force at individual operating subsidiaries or business units and by distributors or brokers.\n\nThe majority of raw and packaging materials used in our products is purchased from other companies and is available from several sources. No single raw or packaging material represents, and no single supplier provides, a significant portion of our total material requirements. We do, however, purchase certain key raw and packaging materials from single-source suppliers or a limited number of suppliers. For certain materials, new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry, governmental and/or Colgate standards (including those relating to responsible sourcing), which can require additional investment and/or take a significant period of time. Raw and packaging material commodities, such as resins, essential oils, tropical oils, pulp, tallow, corn, poultry and soybeans, are subject to market price variations. For further information regarding the impact of changes in commodity prices, see Item 1A, 'Risk Factors - Volatility in material and other costs has in the past and may continue to adversely impact our profitability' and Item 7, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.'\n\nOur products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased retail trade concentration, the substantial growth of eCommerce, the integration of traditional and digital operations at key retailers and the growing presence of large-format retailers, discounters and eCommerce retailers. Products similar to ours are available from multinational and local competitors in the U.S. and around the world. Certain of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we do. In addition, the substantial growth in eCommerce has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models. In certain geographies, we also face strong local competitors, who may be more agile and have better local consumer insights than we do. Private label brands sold by retailers are also a source of competition for certain of our products.\n\nThe retail landscape in many of our markets continues to evolve as a result of the continued growth of eCommerce, changing consumer behavior and preferences (as consumers increasingly shop online, including to compare prices and product availability) and the increased presence of alternative retail channels, such as subscription services and direct-to-consumer businesses. We face competition in several aspects of our business, including pricing, promotional activities, new products and brand introductions and expansion into new geographies and channels.\n\nWe consider trademarks to be material to our business. We follow a practice of seeking trademark protection in the U.S. and throughout the world where our products are sold. Principal global and regional trademarks include Colgate, Palmolive, Darlie, elmex, hello, meridol, Sorriso, Tom's of Maine, EltaMD, Filorga, Irish Spring, Lady Speed Stick, PCA SKIN, Protex, Sanex, Softsoap, Speed Stick, Ajax, Axion, Fabuloso, Murphy, Soupline and Suavitel, as well as Hill's Science Diet and Hill's Prescription Diet.

Segment Information\n\nThe Company operates in two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition.\n\nThe operations of the Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment are managed geographically in five reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Africa/Eurasia.\n\nIn connection with management changes, the Company realigned the reporting structure of its skin health business effective July 1, 2024. Accordingly, commencing with the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the results of the skin health business previously reported within the Europe reportable operating segment are reported with the other skin health businesses in the North America reportable operating segment, with no impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial position. The Company has recast its historical geographic segment information to conform to the new reporting structure.\n\nThe Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including Operating profit. The Company uses Operating profit as a measure of operating segment performance because it excludes the impact of Corporate-driven decisions related to interest expense and income taxes. The Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer has been determined to be the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker who uses Operating Profit to assess performance and to allocate resources for each of the reportable operating segments in the budgeting and forecasting process. Asset information by segment is not utilized for purposes of assessing performance or allocating resources, and therefore such information has not been presented.\n\nThe accounting policies of the operating segments are generally the same as those described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Intercompany sales have been eliminated.

Our business model is focused on delivering sustainable value creation by driving balanced top- and bottom-line growth. We create, manufacture, market and distribute a diversified portfolio of daily-use products to delight consumers with irresistible superiority across five key vectors - product performance, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and value. We invest in research and development and consumer insights to invent new categories or products and innovate our existing products, ensuring they meet evolving consumer needs and preferences. We leverage marketing strategies including advertising, promotions and endorsements to drive brand awareness and loyalty among consumers. The Company utilizes various distribution channels, including retail stores, e-commerce platforms and direct-to-consumer platforms to deliver our products. Our business model relies on continued productivity improvements to fuel investments in R&amp;D and  marketing  and  deliver  value  creation.  Our  objective  is  to  deliver  sustainable  and  balanced  top-  and  bottom-line  growth  while  serving  the  needs  of  all stakeholders - consumers, customers, employees, society and shareowners.\n\nKey Product Categories . Information on key product categories can be found in the MD&amp;A and Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nKey Customers . Our customers include mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores and professional channels. We also sell direct to consumers. Sales to Walmart Inc. and its affiliates represent approximately 16% of our total sales in 2024 and 15% in 2023 and 2022. No other customer represents more than 10% of our total sales. Our top ten customers accounted for 42% of our total net sales in 2024, 40% in 2023 and 39% in 2022.\n\nSources and Availability of M aterials . Almost all of the raw and packaging materials used by the Company are purchased from third parties, some of whom are single-source  suppliers.  We  produce  certain  raw  materials,  primarily  chemicals,  for  further  use  in  the  manufacturing  process.  In  addition,  fuel,  natural  gas  and derivative products are important commodities consumed in our manufacturing processes and in the transportation of input materials and finished products. The prices we pay for materials and other commodities are subject to fluctuation. When prices for these items change, we may or may not pass the change to our customers. The Company purchases a substantial variety of other raw and packaging materials, none of which are material to our business taken as a whole.\n\nTrademarks and Patents . We own or have rights to patents and trademarks, which are used in connection with our activity in all businesses. Our patents cover a range of product features, including significant product formulation and processes used to manufacture our products. The trademarks are important to the overall marketing and branding of our products. In part, our success can be attributed to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks and patents.\n\nCompetitive Condition .  The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. Our products compete against similar products from a broad range of companies, both large and small, both established and new, including well-known global competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. In this highly competitive setting, we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. Our integrated strategy and our focus on driving superiority across product, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and value are key differentiators in the marketplace.",

Segment Information\n\nThe Company operates in two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition.\n\nThe operations of the Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment are managed geographically in five reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Africa/Eurasia.\n\nIn connection with management changes, the Company realigned the reporting structure of its skin health business effective July 1, 2024. Accordingly, commencing with the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the results of the skin health business previously reported within the Europe reportable operating segment are reported with the other skin health businesses in the North America reportable operating segment, with no impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial position. The Company has recast its historical geographic segment information to conform to the new reporting structure.\n\nThe Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including Operating profit. The Company uses Operating profit as a measure of operating segment performance because it excludes the impact of Corporate-driven decisions related to interest expense and income taxes. The Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer has been determined to be the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker who uses Operating Profit to assess performance and to allocate resources for each of the reportable operating segments in the budgeting and forecasting process. Asset information by segment is not utilized for purposes of assessing performance or allocating resources, and therefore such information has not been presented.\n\nThe accounting policies of the operating segments are generally the same as those described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Intercompany sales have been eliminated. Corporate operations include costs related to stock options and restricted stock units, research and development costs, Corporate overhead costs, restructuring and related implementation charges and gains and losses on sales of non-core product lines and assets. The Company reports these items within Corporate operations as they relate to Corporate-based responsibilities and decisions and are not included in the internal measures of segment operating performance used by the Company to measure the underlying performance of the operating segments.\n\nApproximately two-thirds of the Company's Net sales are generated from markets outside the U.S., with approximately 45% of the Company's Net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of Latin America, Asia (excluding Japan), Africa/Eurasia and Central Europe). Oral, Personal and Home Care sales to Walmart, Inc. and its affiliates represent approximately 11% of the Company's Net sales in each of the years 2024, 2023 and 2022.

Pet Nutrition products are sold by authorized pet supply retailers, veterinarians and eCommerce retailers. Certain of our products are also sold direct-to-consumer. Our sales to Walmart, Inc. and its affiliates represented approximately 11% of our Net sales in 2024. No other customer represented more than 10% of our Net sales in 2024. We support our products with advertising, promotion and other marketing (with increasing emphasis on digital) to build awareness and trial of our products. Our products are marketed by a direct sales force at individual operating subsidiaries or business units and by distributors or brokers.\n\nThe majority of raw and packaging materials used in our products is purchased from other companies and is available from several sources. No single raw or packaging material represents, and no single supplier provides, a significant portion of our total material requirements. We do, however, purchase certain key raw and packaging materials from single-source suppliers or a limited number of suppliers. For certain materials, new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry, governmental and/or Colgate standards (including those relating to responsible sourcing), which can require additional investment and/or take a significant period of time. Raw and packaging material commodities, such as resins, essential oils, tropical oils, pulp, tallow, corn, poultry and soybeans, are subject to market price variations. For further information regarding the impact of changes in commodity prices, see Item 1A, 'Risk Factors - Volatility in material and other costs has in the past and may continue to adversely impact our profitability' and Item 7, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.'\n\nOur products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased retail trade concentration, the substantial growth of eCommerce, the integration of traditional and digital operations at key retailers and the growing presence of large-format retailers, discounters and eCommerce retailers. Products similar to ours are available from multinational and local competitors in the U.S. and around the world. Certain of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we do. In addition, the substantial growth in eCommerce has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models. In certain geographies, we also face strong local competitors, who may be more agile and have better local consumer insights than we do. Private label brands sold by retailers are also a source of competition for certain of our products.\n\nThe retail landscape in many of our markets continues to evolve as a result of the continued growth of eCommerce, changing consumer behavior and preferences (as consumers increasingly shop online, including to compare prices and product availability) and the increased presence of alternative retail channels, such as subscription services and direct-to-consumer businesses. We face competition in several aspects of our business, including pricing, promotional activities, new products and brand introductions and expansion into new geographies and channels.\n\nWe consider trademarks to be material to our business. We follow a practice of seeking trademark protection in the U.S. and throughout the world where our products are sold. Principal global and regional trademarks include Colgate, Palmolive, Darlie, elmex, hello, meridol, Sorriso, Tom's of Maine, EltaMD, Filorga, Irish Spring, Lady Speed Stick, PCA SKIN, Protex, Sanex, Softsoap, Speed Stick, Ajax, Axion, Fabuloso, Murphy, Soupline and Suavitel, as well as Hill's Science Diet and Hill's Prescription Diet. Our rights in these trademarks endure for as long as they are used and/or registered.

          "chunk_text": "## Distribution; Raw Materials; Competition; Trademarks and Patents\n\nOur Oral, Personal and Home Care products are sold to a variety of retailers, wholesalers and distributors worldwide. Pet Nutrition products are sold by authorized pet supply retailers, veterinarians and eCommerce retailers. Certain of our products are also sold direct-to-consumer. Our sales to Walmart, Inc. and its affiliates represented approximately 11% of our Net sales in 2024. No other customer represented more than 10% of our Net sales in 2024. We support our products with advertising, promotion and other marketing (with increasing emphasis on digital) to build awareness and trial of our products. Our products are marketed by a direct sales force at individual operating subsidiaries or business units and by distributors or brokers.\n\nThe majority of raw and packaging materials used in our products is purchased from other companies and is available from several sources. No single raw or packaging material represents, and no single supplier provides, a significant portion of our total material requirements. We do, however, purchase certain key raw and packaging materials from single-source suppliers or a limited number of suppliers. For certain materials, new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry, governmental and/or Colgate standards (including those relating to responsible sourcing), which can require additional investment and/or take a significant period of time. Raw and packaging material commodities, such as resins, essential oils, tropical oils, pulp, tallow, corn, poultry and soybeans, are subject to market price variations. For further information regarding the impact of changes in commodity prices, see Item 1A, 'Risk Factors - Volatility in material and other costs has in the past and may continue to adversely impact our profitability' and Item 7, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.'\n\nOur products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased retail trade concentration, the substantial growth of eCommerce, the integration of traditional and digital operations at key retailers and the growing presence of large-format retailers, discounters and eCommerce retailers. Products similar to ours are available from multinational and local competitors in the U.S. and around the world. Certain of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we do. In addition, the substantial growth in eCommerce has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models. In certain geographies, we also face strong local competitors, who may be more agile and have better local consumer insights than we do. Private label brands sold by retailers are also a source of competition for certain of our products.\n\nThe retail landscape in many of our markets continues to evolve as a result of the continued growth of eCommerce, changing consumer behavior and preferences (as consumers increasingly shop online, including to compare prices and product availability) and the increased presence of alternative retail channels, such as subscription services and direct-to-consumer businesses. We face competition in several aspects of our business, including pricing, promotional activities, new products and brand introductions and expansion into new geographies and channels.\n\nWe consider trademarks to be material to our business. We follow a practice of seeking trademark protection in the U.S. and throughout the world where our products are sold. Principal global and regional trademarks include Colgate, Palmolive, Darlie, elmex, hello, meridol, Sorriso, Tom's of Maine, EltaMD, Filorga, Irish Spring, Lady Speed Stick, PCA SKIN, Protex, Sanex, Softsoap, Speed Stick, Ajax, Axion, Fabuloso, Murphy, Soupline and Suavitel, as well as Hill's Science Diet and Hill's Prescription Diet. Our rights in these trademarks endure for as long as they are used and/or registered. Although we actively develop and maintain a portfolio of patents, no single patent is considered significant to the business as a whole.",

Business.\n\nThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company (the Company) is a world-leading multinational consumer goods company focused on providing trusted, branded products of superior quality, performance and value to improve the lives of consumers around the world - now and for generations to come. Our products are sold in about 180 countries and territories throughout the world. The Company was incorporated in Ohio in 1905, having first been established as a New Jersey corporation in 1890, and was built from a business founded in Cincinnati in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble.\n\nAdditional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&amp;A); and Notes 1 and 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms \"Company,\" \"P&amp;G ,\" \"we,\" \"our\" or \"us\" as used herein refer to The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (the registrant) and its subsidiaries. Throughout this Form 10-K, we incorporate by reference information from other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments thereto, are filed electronically with the SEC. The SEC maintains an internet site that contains these reports at: www.sec.gov. Reports can also be accessed and downloaded through links from our website at: www.pginvestor.com. P&amp;G includes the website link solely as a textual reference and the information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this report. Copies of these reports are also available, without charge, by contacting EQ Shareowner Services, 1100 Centre Pointe Curve, Suite 101, Mendota, MN 55120-4100.\n\n## Financial Information about Segments\n\nInformation about our reportable segments can be found in the MD&amp;A and Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Narrative Description of Business\n\nBusiness Model . Our business model is focused on delivering sustainable value creation by driving balanced top- and bottom-line growth. We create, manufacture, market and distribute a diversified portfolio of daily-use products to delight consumers with irresistible superiority across five key vectors - product performance, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and value. We invest in research and development and consumer insights to invent new categories or products and innovate our existing products, ensuring they meet evolving consumer needs and preferences. We leverage marketing strategies including advertising, promotions and endorsements to drive brand awareness and loyalty among consumers. The Company utilizes various distribution channels, including retail stores, e-commerce platforms and direct-to-consumer platforms to deliver our products. Our business model relies on continued productivity improvements to fuel investments in R&amp;D and  marketing  and  deliver  value  creation.  Our  objective  is  to  deliver  sustainable  and  balanced  top-  and  bottom-line  growth  while  serving  the  needs  of  all stakeholders - consumers, customers, employees, society and shareowners.\n\nKey Product Categories . Information on key product categories can be found in the MD&amp;A and Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nKey Customers . Our customers include mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores and professional channels. We also sell direct to consumers. Sales to Walmart Inc. and its affiliates represent approximately 16% of our total sales in 2024 and 15% in 2023 and 2022. No other customer represents more than 10% of our total sales. Our top ten customers accounted for 42% of our total net sales in 2024, 40% in 2023 and 39% in 2022.\n\nSources and Availability of M aterials . Almost all of the raw and packaging materials used by the Company are purchased from third parties, some of whom are single-source  suppliers.  We  produce  certain  raw  materials,  primarily  chemicals,  for  further  use  in  the  manufacturing  process.  In  addition,  fuel,  natural  gas  and derivative products are important commodities consumed in our manufacturing processes and in the transportation of input materials and finished products. The prices we pay for materials and other commodities are subject to fluctuation. When prices for these items change, we may or may not pass the change to our customers. The Company purchases a substantial variety of other raw and packaging materials, none of which are material to our business taken as a whole.\n\nTrademarks and Patents . We own or have rights to patents and trademarks, which are used in connection with our activity in all businesses. Our patents cover a range of product features, including significant product formulation and processes used to manufacture our products. The trademarks are important to the overall marketing and branding of our products. In part, our success can be attributed to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks and patents.\n\nCompetitive Condition .  The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. Our products compete against similar products from a broad range of companies, both large and small, both established and new, including well-known global competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. In this highly competitive setting, we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. Our integrated strategy and our focus on driving superiority across product, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and value are key differentiators in the marketplace.",

      "question": "As both MDLZ and PEP operate in the consumer packaged goods industry and face exposure to Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) policies, how do their disclosures differ in terms of the immediacy and specificity of the financial impacts they anticipate from these regulations?",
      "answer": "MDLZ explicitly states that EPR policies could increase their operating costs immediately, particularly related to packaging, through taxes or regulatory payments. In contrast, PEP acknowledges potential future impacts from EPR policies but frames them as speculative, noting that changes in compliance requirements could adversely affect their financial performance, though no material impact has been realized to date.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from MDLZ's filing that EPR policies are increasing operating costs for things like packaging through taxes or regulations, indicating an immediate and concrete impact.",
        "Step 2: Extract from PEP's filing that while EPR policies are acknowledged, their impacts are described as potential future risks rather than current financial burdens, with no material impact to date.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the difference in immediacy and specificity: MDLZ discusses tangible and current cost increases, while PEP refers to more general and forward-looking concerns."

      "answer": "Altria (MO) addresses inflation through its State Settlement Agreements, where annual payments are adjusted based on the higher of 3% or the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U). As of December 2021, the inflation calculation was approximately 7%, but Altria does not expect a material financial impact. Coca-Cola (KO), on the other hand, addresses inflation through its liquidity, capital resources, and financial position, analyzing the impact of inflation and changing prices in its Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section. While Altria specifically references a formula tied to CPI-U for payment adjustments, Coca-Cola evaluates inflation's broader impact on its global operations and supply chain. Both companies incorporate inflation into financial planning but through different mechanisms\u2014Altria through contractual inflation adjustments and Coca-Cola through operational and liquidity risk assessments.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Overview\n\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ('MD&amp;A') is intended to help the reader understand The Coca-Cola Company, our operations and our present business environment. MD&amp;A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in 'Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' of this report. MD&amp;A includes the following sections:\n\n- Our Business - a general description of our business and its challenges and risks.\n- Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates.\n- Operations Review - an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for 2021 and 2020 and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. An analysis of our consolidated results of operations for 2020 and 2019 and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 can be found in MD&amp;A in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n- Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position - an analysis of cash flows, contractual obligations, foreign exchange, and the impact of inflation and changing prices.\n\n## Our Business\n\n## General\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company is a total beverage company, and beverage products bearing our trademarks, sold in the United States since 1886, are now sold in more than 200 countries and territories. We own or license and market numerous beverage brands, which we group into the following categories: Trademark Coca-Cola; sparkling flavors; hydration, sports, coffee and tea; nutrition, juice, dairy and plant-based beverages; and emerging beverages. We own and market five of the world's top six nonalcoholic sparkling soft drink brands: Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta, Diet Coke and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar.\n\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers as well as the Company's consolidated bottling and distribution operations. Beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us account for 2.1 billion of the approximately 63 billion servings of all beverages consumed worldwide every day.\n\nWe believe our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide variety of beverage options to meet their desires, needs and lifestyles. Our success further depends on the ability of our people to execute effectively, every day.\n\nOur Company markets, manufactures and sells:\n\n- beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as 'beverage bases,' and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our 'concentrate operations'); and\n- finished sparkling soft drinks and other beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our 'finished product operations').\n\nGenerally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations.\n\nOur concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates, syrups and certain finished beverages to authorized bottling operations (to which we typically refer as our 'bottlers' or our 'bottling partners'). Our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still or sparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the product), or combine syrups with still or sparkling water, to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers, such as cans and refillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles, bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through wholesalers or other bottlers. In addition, outside the United States, our bottling partners are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which they sell to fountain retailers for use in producing beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who",

These settlements require participating manufacturers to make substantial annual payments, which are adjusted for several factors, including inflation, operating income, market share and industry volume. Increases in inflation can increase our financial liability under the State Settlement Agreements. The State Settlement Agreements' inflation calculations require us to apply the higher of 3% or the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers ('CPI-U') percentage rate as published in January of each year. As of December 2021, the inflation calculation was approximately 7% based on the latest CPI-U data; however, the increase in the annual payments did not have a material impact on Altria's financial position. Altria believes that inflation will continue at increased levels in 2022, but does not expect the corresponding increase in annual payments to result in a material financial impact. However, we will continue to monitor conditions related to the impact of increased inflation on the macroeconomic environment.\n\nFor a discussion of the impact of the State Settlement Agreements on Altria, see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation below and Note 18. The State Settlement Agreements also place numerous requirements and restrictions on participating manufacturers' business operations, including prohibitions and restrictions on the advertising and marketing of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products. Among these are prohibitions of outdoor and transit brand advertising, payments for product placement and free sampling (except in adult-only facilities). The State Settlement Agreements also place restrictions on the use of brand name sponsorships and brand name non-tobacco products and prohibitions on targeting youth and the use of cartoon characters. In addition, the State Settlement Agreements require companies to affirm corporate principles directed at reducing underage use of cigarettes; impose requirements regarding lobbying activities; limit the industry's ability to challenge certain tobacco control and underage use laws; and provide for the dissolution of certain tobacco-related organizations and place restrictions on the establishment of any replacement organizations.\n\nIn November 1998, USSTC entered into the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (the 'STMSA') with the attorneys general of various states and United States territories to resolve the remaining health care cost reimbursement cases initiated against USSTC. The STMSA required USSTC to adopt various marketing and advertising restrictions. USSTC is the only smokeless tobacco manufacturer to sign the STMSA.\n\n## Other International, Federal, State and Local Regulation and Governmental and Private Activity\n\n- International, Federal, State and Local Regulation: Various states and localities have enacted or proposed legislation that imposes restrictions on tobacco products (including cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, cigars, e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouches), such as legislation that (i) prohibits the sale of all tobacco products or certain tobacco categories, such as e-vapor, (ii) prohibits the sale of tobacco products with characterizing flavors, such as menthol cigarettes and flavored e-vapor products, (iii) requires the disclosure of health information separate from or in addition to federally mandated health warnings and (iv) restricts commercial speech or imposes additional restrictions on the marketing or sale of tobacco products. The legislation varies in terms of the type of tobacco products, the conditions under which such products are or would be restricted or prohibited, and exceptions to the restrictions or prohibitions. For example, a number of proposals involving characterizing flavors would prohibit smokeless tobacco products with characterizing flavors without providing an exception for mint- or wintergreen-flavored products. As of February 22, 2022, multiple states and localities are considering legislation to ban flavors in one or more tobacco products, and six states (California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Utah, New York and Illinois) and the District of Columbia have passed such legislation. Some of these states, such as New York, Utah and Illinois, exempt certain products that have received FDA market authorization through the PMTA pathway.\n\nThe legislation in California bans the sale of most tobacco products with characterizing flavors, including menthol, mint and wintergreen. Following enactment of the flavor ban in August 2020, several registered California voters filed a referendum against the legislation. In January 2021 the requisite number of registered California voters signed a petition to place the question of whether the legislation should be affirmed or overturned on the next statewide general election ballot, which will likely take place in November 2022, unless a special statewide election is called earlier. As a result, the implementation of the legislation is delayed until after a vote on the referendum occurs.\n\nMassachusetts passed legislation capping the amount of nicotine in e-vapor products. Similar legislation is pending in one other state.\n\nRestrictions on e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products also have been instituted or proposed internationally.\n\nAltria's tobacco operating companies have challenged and will continue to challenge certain federal, state and local legislation and other governmental action, including through litigation. It is possible, however, that legislation, regulation or other governmental action could be enacted or implemented that could have a material adverse impact on the business and volume of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees, and the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL. Such action also could negatively impact adult smokers' transition to these products, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve our Vision.",

If we or our bottling partners fail to comply with applicable product safety and quality standards, or if our beverage products taken to the market are or become contaminated or adulterated by any means, we may be required to conduct costly product recalls and may become subject to product liability claims and negative publicity, which could cause our business to suffer.\n\n## Public debate and concern about perceived negative health consequences of certain ingredients, such as non-nutritive sweeteners and biotechnology-derived substances, and of other substances present in our beverage products or packaging materials, may reduce demand for our beverage products.\n\nPublic debate and concern about perceived negative health consequences of certain ingredients in our beverage products, such as synthetic colors, non-nutritive sweeteners and biotechnology-derived substances; substances that are present in our beverage products naturally or that occur as a result of the manufacturing process, such as 4-methylimidazole ('4-MEI'), a chemical compound that is formed during the manufacturing of certain types of caramel coloring used in cola-flavored beverages; or substances used in packaging materials, such as bisphenol A ('BPA'), an odorless, tasteless food-grade chemical commonly used in the food and beverage industries as a component in the coating of the interior of cans, may affect consumers' preferences and cause them to shift away from some of our beverage products. In addition, increasing public concern about actual or perceived health consequences of the presence of such ingredients or substances in our beverage products or in packaging materials, whether or not justified, could result in additional governmental regulations concerning the advertising, marketing, labeling, packaging or sale of our beverages; possible new or increased taxes on our beverages by government entities; and negative publicity, or actual or threatened legal actions against us or other companies in our industry, all of which could damage the reputation of, and may reduce demand for, our beverage products.\n\n## If we are not successful in our efforts to digitize the Coca-Cola system, our financial results could be negatively affected.\n\nThe digital evolution is affecting how we interact with consumers, customers, suppliers, bottlers and other business partners and stakeholders. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to adapt to and thrive in the digital environment. Therefore, one of our top priorities is to digitize the Coca-Cola system by, among other things, creating more relevant and more personalized experiences wherever our system interacts with consumers, whether in a digital environment or through digital devices in an otherwise physical environment; finding ways to create more powerful digital tools and capabilities for the Coca-Cola system's retail customers to enable them to grow their businesses; and digitizing operations through the use of data, artificial intelligence, automation, robotics and digital devices to increase efficiency and productivity. If we are not successful in our efforts to digitize the Coca-Cola system, our ability to increase sales and reduce costs may be negatively affected and the cost and expenses we have incurred or may incur in connection with our digitization initiatives may adversely impact our financial performance.\n\n## If negative publicity, whether or not warranted, concerning product safety or quality, workplace and human rights, obesity or other issues damages our brand image, corporate reputation and social license to operate, our business may suffer.\n\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to maintain the brand image of our existing products, build up the brand image for new products and brand extensions, and maintain our corporate reputation and social license to operate. However, our continuing investment in advertising and marketing and our strong commitment to product safety and quality and human rights have not always had, and may not in the future always have, the desired impact on our products' brand image and on consumer preferences. Product safety or quality issues, actual or perceived, or allegations of product contamination, even when false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of the affected brands and may cause consumers to choose other products. In some emerging markets, the production and sale of counterfeit or 'spurious' products, which we and our bottling partners may not be able to fully combat, may damage the image and reputation of our products. In addition, from time to time, we and our executives have engaged, and may in the future engage, in public policy endeavors that are either directly related to our products and packaging or to our business operations and the general economic climate affecting the Company. These engagements in public policy debates have been, and could in the future be, the subject of backlash from advocacy groups or others that have a differing point of view and could result in adverse media and consumer reaction, including product boycotts. Similarly, our sponsorship relationships have subjected us in the past, and could subject us in the future, to negative publicity as a result of actual or alleged misconduct by individuals, hosts or entities associated with organizations we sponsor or support financially or through in-kind contributions. Likewise, campaigns by activists connecting us, or our bottling system or supply chain, with workplace and human rights issues, whether actual or perceived, could adversely impact our corporate image and reputation. Additionally, negative postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands, even if inaccurate or malicious, have in the past, and could in the future, generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the Company. Furthermore, the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, endorsed by the United Nations Human Rights Council, outline how businesses should implement the corporate responsibility to respect human rights principles included in the United Nations 'Protect, Respect and Remedy' framework on human rights. Allegations, even if untrue, that we are not respecting one or more of the 30 human rights found in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights; actual or perceived failure by our suppliers or other business partners to comply with applicable workplace and labor laws, including child labor laws, or their actual or perceived abuse or misuse of migrant",

Suppliers and supply chain service providers also rely extensively on information systems. We continue to make appropriate investments in administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect our information systems and data from cyber-threats, including human error and malicious acts. Our safeguards include employee training, testing and auditing protocols, backup systems and business continuity plans, maintenance of security policies and procedures, monitoring of networks and systems, and third-party risk management.\n\nFrom time-to-time Altria and its suppliers experience attempts to infiltrate and interrupt information systems. While infiltration attempts have increased, to date, interruptions of these information systems as a result of infiltration attempts have not had a material impact on our operations. However, because technology is increasingly complex and cyber-attacks are increasingly sophisticated and more frequent, there can be no assurance that such incidents will not have a material adverse effect on us in the future. Failure of Altria's or its investees' information systems or service providers' or key suppliers' information systems to function as intended, or cyber-attacks or security breaches, could result in loss of revenue, assets, personal data, intellectual property, trade secrets or other sensitive and confidential data, violation of applicable privacy and data security laws, reputational harm to the companies and their brands, operational disruptions, legal challenges and significant remediation and other costs to Altria, its subsidiaries and its investees.",

These concerns may reduce consumer demand, trigger additional government regulations, and lead to legal actions. In contrast, Altria faces health-related risks due to the well-publicized health effects of tobacco products, including e-vapor products, and vaping-related lung injuries. These concerns have led to increased regulatory scrutiny, including legislation raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco products to 21 and restrictions on smoking and vaping in public and private spaces. Both companies face potential demand reduction and regulatory challenges, but the nature and context of the health concerns differ significantly, with Coca-Cola's centered on product ingredients and packaging, and Altria's centered on the inherent health risks of tobacco and vaping products.",

If we or our bottling partners fail to comply with applicable product safety and quality standards, or if our beverage products taken to the market are or become contaminated or adulterated by any means, we may be required to conduct costly product recalls and may become subject to product liability claims and negative publicity, which could cause our business to suffer.\n\n## Public debate and concern about perceived negative health consequences of certain ingredients, such as non-nutritive sweeteners and biotechnology-derived substances, and of other substances present in our beverage products or packaging materials, may reduce demand for our beverage products.\n\nPublic debate and concern about perceived negative health consequences of certain ingredients in our beverage products, such as synthetic colors, non-nutritive sweeteners and biotechnology-derived substances; substances that are present in our beverage products naturally or that occur as a result of the manufacturing process, such as 4-methylimidazole ('4-MEI'), a chemical compound that is formed during the manufacturing of certain types of caramel coloring used in cola-flavored beverages; or substances used in packaging materials, such as bisphenol A ('BPA'), an odorless, tasteless food-grade chemical commonly used in the food and beverage industries as a component in the coating of the interior of cans, may affect consumers' preferences and cause them to shift away from some of our beverage products. In addition, increasing public concern about actual or perceived health consequences of the presence of such ingredients or substances in our beverage products or in packaging materials, whether or not justified, could result in additional governmental regulations concerning the advertising, marketing, labeling, packaging or sale of our beverages; possible new or increased taxes on our beverages by government entities; and negative publicity, or actual or threatened legal actions against us or other companies in our industry, all of which could damage the reputation of, and may reduce demand for, our beverage products.\n\n## If we are not successful in our efforts to digitize the Coca-Cola system, our financial results could be negatively affected.\n\nThe digital evolution is affecting how we interact with consumers, customers, suppliers, bottlers and other business partners and stakeholders. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to adapt to and thrive in the digital environment. Therefore, one of our top priorities is to digitize the Coca-Cola system by, among other things, creating more relevant and more personalized experiences wherever our system interacts with consumers, whether in a digital environment or through digital devices in an otherwise physical environment; finding ways to create more powerful digital tools and capabilities for the Coca-Cola system's retail customers to enable them to grow their businesses; and digitizing operations through the use of data, artificial intelligence, automation, robotics and digital devices to increase efficiency and productivity. If we are not successful in our efforts to digitize the Coca-Cola system, our ability to increase sales and reduce costs may be negatively affected and the cost and expenses we have incurred or may incur in connection with our digitization initiatives may adversely impact our financial performance.\n\n## If negative publicity, whether or not warranted, concerning product safety or quality, workplace and human rights, obesity or other issues damages our brand image, corporate reputation and social license to operate, our business may suffer.\n\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to maintain the brand image of our existing products, build up the brand image for new products and brand extensions, and maintain our corporate reputation and social license to operate. However, our continuing investment in advertising and marketing and our strong commitment to product safety and quality and human rights have not always had, and may not in the future always have, the desired impact on our products' brand image and on consumer preferences. Product safety or quality issues, actual or perceived, or allegations of product contamination, even when false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of the affected brands and may cause consumers to choose other products. In some emerging markets, the production and sale of counterfeit or 'spurious' products, which we and our bottling partners may not be able to fully combat, may damage the image and reputation of our products. In addition, from time to time, we and our executives have engaged, and may in the future engage, in public policy endeavors that are either directly related to our products and packaging or to our business operations and the general economic climate affecting the Company. These engagements in public policy debates have been, and could in the future be, the subject of backlash from advocacy groups or others that have a differing point of view and could result in adverse media and consumer reaction, including product boycotts. Similarly, our sponsorship relationships have subjected us in the past, and could subject us in the future, to negative publicity as a result of actual or alleged misconduct by individuals, hosts or entities associated with organizations we sponsor or support financially or through in-kind contributions. Likewise, campaigns by activists connecting us, or our bottling system or supply chain, with workplace and human rights issues, whether actual or perceived, could adversely impact our corporate image and reputation. Additionally, negative postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands, even if inaccurate or malicious, have in the past, and could in the future, generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the Company. Furthermore, the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, endorsed by the United Nations Human Rights Council, outline how businesses should implement the corporate responsibility to respect human rights principles included in the United Nations 'Protect, Respect and Remedy' framework on human rights. Allegations, even if untrue, that we are not respecting one or more of the 30 human rights found in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights; actual or perceived failure by our suppliers or other business partners to comply with applicable workplace and labor laws, including child labor laws, or their actual or perceived abuse or misuse of migrant",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n- Federal, State and Local Legislation to Increase the Legal Age to Purchase Tobacco Products: After a number of states and localities proposed and enacted legislation to increase the minimum age to purchase all tobacco products, including e-vapor products, in December 2019, the federal government passed legislation increasing the minimum age to purchase all tobacco products, including e-vapor products, to 21 nationwide. As of February 22, 2022, 39 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have enacted laws increasing the legal age to purchase tobacco products to 21. Although an increase in the minimum age to purchase tobacco products may have a negative impact on sales volume of our tobacco businesses, as discussed above under Underage Access and Use of Certain Tobacco Products, Altria supports raising the minimum legal age to purchase all tobacco products to 21 at the federal and state levels, reflecting its longstanding commitment to combat underage tobacco use.\n- Health Effects of Tobacco Products, Including E-vapor Products: Reports with respect to the health effects of smoking have been publicized for many years, including various reports by the U.S. Surgeon General. In 2019, there were public health advisories concerning vaping-related lung injuries and deaths and there have been health concerns raised about potential increased risks associated with COVID-19 among smokers and vapers. Altria believes that the public should be guided by the messages of the U.S. Surgeon General and public health authorities worldwide in making decisions concerning the use of tobacco products, including evapor products.\n\nMost jurisdictions within the United States have restricted smoking in public places and some have restricted vaping in public places. Some public health groups have called for, and various jurisdictions have adopted or proposed, bans on smoking and vaping in outdoor places, in private apartments and in cars transporting children. It is not possible to predict the results of ongoing scientific research or the types of future scientific research into the health risks of tobacco exposure and the impact of such research on legislation and regulation.\n\n- Other Legislation or Governmental Initiatives: In addition to the actions discussed above, other regulatory initiatives affecting the tobacco industry have been adopted or are being considered at the federal level and in a number of state and local jurisdictions. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, state and local governments required additional health and safety requirements of all businesses, including tobacco manufacturing and other facilities. State and local governments also mandated the temporary closure of some businesses. While many restrictions have eased, it is possible that tobacco manufacturing and other facilities and the facilities of our suppliers, our suppliers' suppliers and our trade partners could be subject to additional government-mandated temporary closures and restrictions.\n\nAdditionally, in recent years, legislation has been introduced or enacted at the state or local level to subject tobacco products to various reporting requirements and performance standards; establish educational campaigns relating to tobacco consumption or tobacco control programs or provide additional funding for governmental tobacco control activities; restrict the sale of tobacco products in certain retail establishments and the sale of tobacco products in certain package sizes; prohibit the sale of tobacco products based on environmental concerns; require tax stamping of smokeless tobacco products; require the use of state tax stamps using data encryption technology; and further restrict the sale, marketing and advertising of cigarettes and other tobacco products. Such legislation may be subject to constitutional or other challenges on various grounds, which may or may not be successful.\n\nIt is not possible to predict what, if any, additional legislation, regulation or other governmental action will be enacted or implemented (and, if challenged, upheld) relating to the manufacturing, design, packaging, marketing, advertising, sale or use of tobacco products, or the tobacco industry generally. It is possible, however, that legislation, regulation or other governmental action could be enacted or implemented that could have a material adverse impact on the business and volume of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees, and the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL.\n\n- Governmental Investigations: From time to time, Altria and its subsidiaries and investees are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters.  For example: (i) the FTC issued a Civil Investigative Demand ('CID') to Altria while conducting its antitrust review of Altria's investment in JUUL seeking information regarding, among other things, Altria's role in the resignation of JUUL's former chief executive officer and the hiring by JUUL of any current or former Altria director, executive or employee (see Note 18 and Item 3 for a description of the FTC's administrative complaint against Altria and JUUL); (ii) the SEC commenced an investigation relating to Altria's acquisition, disclosures and accounting controls in connection with the JUUL investment; and (iii) the New York State Office of the Attorney General and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Office of the Attorney General, separately, issued independent subpoenas to Altria seeking documents relating to Altria's investment in and provision of services to JUUL. Additionally, JUUL is currently under investigation by various federal and state agencies, including the SEC, the FDA and the FTC, and state attorneys general.  Such investigations vary in scope but at least some appear to include JUUL's marketing practices, particularly as such practices relate to youth, and Altria may be asked in the context of those investigations to provide information concerning its investment in JUUL or relating to its marketing of Nu Mark LLC e-vapor products.\n\n## Private Sector Activity on E-Vapor\n\nA number of retailers, including national chains, have discontinued the sale of e-vapor products. Reasons for the discontinuation include reported illnesses related to e-vapor product use and the uncertain regulatory environment. It is possible that this private sector activity",

          "chunk_text": "Despite the pandemic, we are not losing sight of long-term opportunities for our business. The pandemic helped us realize we could be much bolder in our efforts to change. We identified the following key objectives to navigate the pandemic and position us to capture growth: winning more consumers; gaining market share; maintaining strong system economics; strengthening stakeholder impact; and equipping the organization to win. In order to deliver against these objectives, we focused on the following priorities: unlocking the potential of our portfolio of strong global, regional and scaled local brands; developing a robust innovation pipeline focusing on scalable initiatives; increasing consumer-centric marketing effectiveness and efficiency; winning in the marketplace with aligned data-driven revenue growth management and execution capabilities; and further embedding ESG goals into our operations. In August 2020, the Company announced strategic steps to transform our organizational structure to better enable us to capture growth in the fast-changing marketplace. The Company has transformed into a networked global organization designed to combine the power of scale with the deep knowledge required to win locally. Refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our strategic realignment initiatives.\n\n## Challenges and Risks\n\nBeing global provides unique opportunities for our Company. Challenges and risks accompany those opportunities. Our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of our Company and the commercial beverage industry. Of these, five key challenges and risks are discussed below.\n\n## Obesity\n\nThe rates of obesity affecting communities, cultures and countries worldwide continue to be too high. There is growing concern among consumers, public health professionals and government agencies about the health problems associated with obesity. This concern represents a significant challenge to our industry. We understand and recognize that obesity is a complex public health challenge and are committed to being a part of the solution.\n\nWe recognize the uniqueness of consumers' lifestyles and dietary choices. Therefore, we continue to:\n\n- offer reduced-, low- and no-calorie beverage options;\n- provide transparent nutrition information, featuring calories on the front of most of our packages;\n- provide our beverages in a range of packaging sizes; and\n- market responsibly, including no advertising targeted to children under 12.\n\nThe heritage of our Company is to lead, and innovation is critical for leadership. As such, we are resolute in continuing to innovate and are committed to partnering to find winning solutions in the area of noncaloric sweeteners. This includes working to reduce sugar and calories in many of our beverages. We want to be a helpful and credible partner in the fight against obesity. Across the Coca-Cola system, we are mobilizing our assets in marketing and in community outreach to increase awareness and spur action.\n\n## Evolving Consumer Product Preferences\n\nWe are impacted by shifting consumer demographics and needs, on-the-go lifestyles and consumers who are empowered with more information than ever. As a consequence of these changes, many consumers want more beverage choices, personalization, a focus on sustainability and recyclability, and transparency related to our products and packaging. We are committed to meeting their needs and to generating growth through our evolving portfolio of beverage brands and products (including numerous low- and nocalorie products), selectively expanding into other profitable categories of the commercial beverage industry, innovative and sustainable packaging, and ingredient education efforts. We are also committed to continuing to expand the variety of choices we provide to consumers and to providing options that reflect consumer concerns about impacts to the planet.\n\n## Evolving Competitive Landscape and Competing in the Digital Marketplace\n\nOur Company faces strong competition from well-established global companies as well as numerous regional and local companies. Additionally, the rapidly evolving digital landscape and growth of e-commerce in many markets has led to dramatic shifts in consumer shopping habits and patterns. Consumers are rapidly embracing shopping via mobile device applications, e-commerce retailers and e-commerce websites or platforms, which presents new challenges to maintain the competitiveness and relevancy of our brands. As a result, we must continuously strengthen our capabilities in marketing and innovation in order to compete in a digital environment and maintain our brand loyalty and market share. In addition, we are increasing our investments in e-commerce to support retail and meal delivery services, offering more package sizes that are fit-for-purpose for online sales, and shifting more consumer and trade promotions to digital.",

We, along with other beverage companies, are affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the cost to manufacture and distribute products, consumer spending, economic conditions, availability and quality of water, consumer preferences, inflation, political climates, local and national laws and regulations, foreign currency fluctuations, fuel prices, weather patterns and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThroughout 2021, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related actions by governments around the world to attempt to contain the spread of the virus continued to impact our business globally. In particular, the number of people contracting COVID19 and the preventive measures taken to contain COVID-19, including the spread of new variants, negatively impacted our unit case volume and increased our costs to manufacture and distribute our products. Our price, product and geographic mix was also negatively impacted, primarily due to unfavorable channel and product mix as consumer demand shifted to more at-home consumption versus away-from-home consumption. However, the timing and number of people receiving vaccinations, the governmental actions to reopen certain economies around the world, and the substance and pace of the economic recovery favorably impacted our business when compared to 2020. While uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic remain, and factors such as the state of the supply chain, labor shortages and the inflationary environment are likely to impact the pace of the economic recovery, we expect to continue to see improvements in our business as we continue to learn and adapt to the everchanging environment.\n\nThe Company's priorities during the COVID-19 pandemic and related business disruptions are ensuring the health and safety of our employees; supporting and making a difference in the communities we serve; keeping our brands in supply; maintaining the quality and safety of our products; and serving our customers across all channels as they adapt to the shifting demands of consumers during the pandemic.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, business continuity and adapting to the needs of our customers have been critical. We have developed systemwide knowledge-sharing routines and processes, which include the management of any supply chain challenges. As of the date of this filing, while we have experienced some temporary supply chain disruptions, there has been no material impact, and we do not foresee a material impact, on our and our bottling partners' ability to manufacture or distribute our products.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\ndespite some temporary volatility in commercial paper markets in 2020, Altria has not experienced a material adverse impact to its liquidity.\n\nAs with so many other companies throughout the United States and globally, Altria's operations have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, Altria believes its tobacco businesses have not experienced any material adverse effects associated with governmental actions to restrict consumer movement or business operations, but continues to monitor these factors. Altria continues to operate in a remote working environment for many employees and believes that remote working due to the COVID-19 pandemic has had minimal impact on productivity. Also, Altria's critical information technology systems have remained operational. Although Altria's tobacco businesses previously suspended operations temporarily at several of their manufacturing facilities in March 2020, the businesses resumed operations at those facilities under enhanced safety protocols in April 2020, and all manufacturing and nonmanufacturing facilities are currently operational under enhanced safety protocols recommended by public health authorities. Altria continues to monitor the risks associated with facility disruptions and workforce availability as a result of uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic and guidance from public health officials as it evolves its safety protocols.\n\nAltria also continues to monitor the inflationary environment arising in part from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on Altria's financial position and results of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2021, inflation did not have a material impact on Altria's MSA expense or on direct materials and other costs. While Altria anticipates that inflation will continue at increased levels in 2022, it does not believe the impacts will be material to Altria's financial position and results of operations. See Operating Results by Business Segment - Tobacco Space - State Settlement Agreements below for further discussion on MSA expense.\n\nAltria's suppliers and those within its distribution chain continue to be subject to potential facility closures, remote working protocols, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions and inflation. To date, Altria has not experienced any material disruptions to its supply chains or distribution systems. Altria continues to monitor the risk that the business of one or more suppliers, distributors or any other entities within its supply and distribution chains may be disrupted.\n\nAltria believes that the COVID-19 pandemic altered adult tobacco consumer behaviors and purchasing patterns, particularly in the earlier stages of the pandemic. While the number of adult tobacco consumer trips to the store remain below pre-pandemic levels and tobacco expenditures per trip remain elevated, the environment continues to evolve as the effects of government stimulus have lessened and consumer mobility returns to more normal levels. Although Altria's tobacco businesses have not experienced a material adverse impact to date by the COVID-19 pandemic, there is continued uncertainty as to how the COVID-19 pandemic (including changes in COVID-19-related restrictions and guidelines and new variants) may impact adult tobacco consumers in the future. Altria continues to monitor the macroeconomic risks of the COVID-19 pandemic (including risks associated with the timing and extent of vaccine administration and the impact of COVID-19 variants), and their effect on adult tobacco consumers, including stay-at-home practices and disposable income, which may be further impacted by unemployment rates and inflation. Altria also continues to monitor adult tobacco consumers' purchasing behaviors, including overall tobacco product expenditures, mix between premium and discount brand purchases and adoption of smoke-free products. See Operating Results by Business Segment - Tobacco Space Business Environment Summary below for further discussion of economic conditions and the impact on adult tobacco consumer purchasing behavior.\n\nDuring 2021, ABI continued to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the effects of COVID-19 variants, supply-chain constraints across certain markets, adverse transactional foreign exchange rates, inflation and commodity cost headwinds. While Altria considers the impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic that have negatively impacted ABI's global business to be transitory, Altria will continue to monitor its investment in ABI, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ABI's business and market valuation. See Note 6 for further discussion of Altria's investment in ABI, including the recording of a $6.2 billion non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge in 2021.\n\nAltria considered the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the business of JUUL, including its sales, distribution, operations, supply chain and liquidity, in conducting its periodic impairment assessment and quantitative valuations. JUUL's operations were negatively impacted in 2020 and 2021 by the COVID-19 pandemic due to stay-at-home practices and government-mandated restrictions. While the impact was considered in Altria's quantitative valuations conducted in connection with the preparation of its financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, Altria does not believe the COVID-19 pandemic was a primary driver of the noncash, pre-tax impairment charge recorded during 2020 or any quarterly changes in fair value recorded since the fourth quarter of 2020. Altria will continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on JUUL's business, including near-term supply chain constraints, component part shortages and inflation, in Altria's quarterly quantitative valuations of JUUL. See Note 6 for further discussion of Altria's investment in JUUL.\n\nAltria considered the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the business of Cronos, including its sales, distribution, operations, supply chain and liquidity. During 2020 and 2021, Cronos was adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, due in part to government actions limiting access to retail stores in the United States and Canada. Altria will continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Cronos's business, including as a result of new variants, near-term supply chain challenges, inflation and market valuation. See Note 6 for further discussion of Altria's investment in Cronos.",

      "answer": "Costco highlights that its international operations are subject to legal and regulatory risks, including political and economic conditions and regulatory constraints, which could negatively affect its business. These risks are particularly relevant as Costco operated 260 warehouses outside the U.S. as of the end of 2022 and plans further international expansion. Meanwhile, Altria's financial exposure is demonstrated through its equity investment in ABI, where a strengthening U.S. dollar reduces the USD value of ABI's earnings and dividends. Additionally, Altria recorded a $6.2 billion non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge in 2021 due to the carrying value of its ABI investment exceeding its fair value. These examples show that while Costco faces operational and regulatory risks in international markets, Altria experiences financial risks through currency translation and investment impairment related to its international holdings.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Costco operated 260 warehouses outside the U.S. as of the end of 2022 and faces legal and regulatory risks, including political and economic conditions and regulatory constraints.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Altria's reported earnings and dividends from its equity investment in ABI are negatively affected when the USD strengthens against local currencies, and Altria recorded a $6.2 billion non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge in 2021 for ABI's investment decline.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Costco's international legal and regulatory risks primarily affect operational performance, while Altria's financial exposure is tied to currency translation and impairment impacts on its international investments. Both demonstrate distinct financial risks for multinational corporations."

Government regulations limiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may increase compliance and merchandise costs, and other regulation affecting energy inputs could materially affect our profitability. As the economy transitions to lower  carbon  intensity  we  cannot  guarantee  that  we  will  make  adequate  investments  or  successfully  implement strategies  that  will  effectively  achieve  our  climate-related  goals,  which  could  lead  to  negative  perceptions  among members  and  other  stakeholders  and  result  in  reputational  harm.  Climate  change,  extreme  weather  conditions, wildfires, droughts and rising sea levels could affect our ability to procure commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience.\n\nWe also sell a substantial amount of gasoline, the demand for which could be impacted by concerns about climate change and increased regulations. More stringent fuel economy standards and public policies aimed at increasing the adoption of zero-emission and alternative fuel vehicles and other regulations related to climate change will affect our future operations and may adversely impact our profitability, and require significant capital expenditures.\n\n## Failure  to  meet  financial  market  expectations  could  adversely  affect  the  market  price  and  volatility  of  our stock.\n\nWe believe that the price of our stock currently reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our warehouse and e-commerce comparable sales growth  rates,  membership  renewal  rates,  new  member  sign-ups,  gross  margin,  earnings,  earnings  per  share,  new warehouse openings, or dividend or stock repurchase policies could cause the price of our stock to decline.\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Risks\n\nWe are subject to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAt  the  end  of  2022,  we  operated  260  warehouses  outside  of  the  U.S.,  and  we  plan  to  continue  expanding  our international  operations.  Future  operating  results  internationally  could  be  negatively  affected  by  a  variety  of  factors, many similar to those we face in the U.S., certain of which are beyond our control. These factors include political and economic conditions, regulatory constraints, currency regulations,",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nAltria's reported earnings from and carrying value of its equity investment in ABI and the dividends paid by ABI on shares owned by Altria may be adversely affected by various factors, including foreign currency exchange rates and ABI's business results, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and ABI's stock price.\n\nFor purposes of financial reporting, the earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in ABI are translated into U.S. dollars ('USD') from various local currencies. In addition, ABI pays dividends in euros, which we convert into USD. During times of a strengthening USD against these currencies, our reported earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in ABI will be reduced because these currencies will translate into fewer USD and the dividends that we receive from ABI will convert into fewer USD. Dividends and earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in ABI are also subject to the risks encountered by ABI in its business, its business outlook, cash flow requirements and financial performance, the state of the market and the general economic climate, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in 2020, as a result of the uncertainty, volatility and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ABI's business, ABI reduced by 50% its final 2019 dividend paid in the second quarter of 2020 and did not pay its interim 2020 dividend that would have been paid in the fourth quarter of 2020, which resulted in a reduction of cash dividends Altria received from ABI.\n\n## If the carrying value of our investment in ABI exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary, the investment is considered impaired, which would result in additional impairment losses and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or earnings.\n\nAs further discussed in Note 6, in preparing our financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2021, we concluded that the carrying value of our investment in ABI exceeded the fair value of our equity investment in ABI and that the decline in fair value of our investment in ABI below its carrying value was other than temporary at September 30, 2021. As a result, we recorded a non-cash, pretax impairment charge of $6.2 billion for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2021 to (income) losses from equity investments in Altria's condensed consolidated statements of earnings (losses). If ABI is unable to successfully execute its business plans and strategies and the carrying value of our investment in ABI again exceeds the fair value of our investment in ABI, it could result in additional impairment losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or earnings.\n\nIf our percentage ownership in ABI were to decrease below certain levels, we may be subject to additional tax liabilities, incur a reduction in the number of directors that we can have appointed to the ABI board of directors and be unable to account for our investment in ABI under the equity method of accounting.\n\nIn the event that our ownership percentage in ABI were to decrease below certain levels, (i) we may be subject to additional tax liabilities, (ii) the number of directors that we have the right to have appointed to the ABI board of directors could be reduced from two to one or zero and (iii) we may be unable to continue to account for our investment in ABI under the equity method of accounting.\n\nTax authorities may challenge the tax treatment of the consideration Altria received in the October 2016 SABMiller plc/ABI business combination ('ABI Transaction') and the tax treatment of our investment in ABI may not be as favorable as Altria anticipates.\n\nWhile we expect the tax treatment of the consideration that we received from the ABI Transaction to be respected, the statute of limitations for the tax year in which the transaction occurred has not expired. Therefore, we cannot provide any assurance that federal and state tax authorities will not challenge the expected tax treatment and, if they do, what the outcome of any such challenge will be. In addition, there is a risk that the tax treatment of our investment in ABI may not be as favorable as we anticipate.\n\n## The expected benefits of the Cronos transaction may not materialize in the expected manner or timeframe or at all.\n\nIn March 2019, we acquired common shares representing a 45% equity interest in Cronos, a warrant to acquire common shares representing an additional 10% equity interest in Cronos and anti-dilution protections to purchase Cronos shares to maintain our ownership percentage. There can be no assurance that we will realize the expected benefits of the Cronos transaction, including due to the risks encountered by Cronos in its business, some of which are described in various risk factors above, such as operational risks and legal and regulatory risks; unanticipated impacts on Cronos's relationships with third parties, its management, or its current or future plans and operations due to the Cronos transaction or other factors; or domestic or international litigation developments, tax disputes, investigations, or otherwise; or that Cronos will successfully execute its business plans and strategies. Further, a failure by Cronos or Altria to comply with applicable laws, including cannabis laws, could result in criminal, civil or tax liability or reputational harm for Altria.\n\nIf the carrying value of our investment in Cronos exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary, the investment is considered impaired, which would result in impairment losses and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or earnings.\n\nAs further discussed in Note 6, in preparing our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, we concluded that our equity method investment in Cronos declined below its carrying value and that there was not sufficient evidence to conclude that the impairment was temporary. As a result, we recorded a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge of $205 million to (income) losses from equity investments in our consolidated statement of earnings (losses) for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Stock Plans\n\nIn 2020, the Board of Directors adopted, and shareholders approved, the Altria Group, Inc. 2020 Performance Incentive Plan (the '2020 Plan'). The 2020 Plan succeeded the 2015 Performance Incentive Plan, under which no new awards were permitted to be made after May 31, 2020. Under the 2020 Plan, Altria may grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units ('RSUs'), performance stock units ('PSUs') and other stock-based awards, as well as cash-based annual and long-term incentive awards to employees of Altria or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. Any awards granted pursuant to the 2020 Plan may be in the form of performance-based awards, including PSUs subject to the achievement or satisfaction of performance goals and performance cycles. Up to 25 million shares of common stock may be issued under the 2020 Plan. In addition, under the 2015 Stock Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the 'Directors Plan'), Altria may grant up to one million shares of common stock to members of the Board of Directors who are not employees of Altria.\n\nShares available to be granted under the 2020 Plan and the Directors Plan at December 31, 2021, were 23,459,288 and 703,256, respectively.\n\n- RSUs: During the vesting period, RSUs include nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents and may not be sold, assigned, pledged or otherwise encumbered. RSUs are subject to forfeiture if certain employment conditions are not met. Altria estimates the number of awards expected to be forfeited and adjusts this estimate when subsequent information indicates that the actual number of forfeitures is likely to differ from previous estimates. RSUs generally vest three years after the grant date.\n\nThe fair value of the RSUs at the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures, is amortized to expense ratably over the restriction period, which is generally three years. Altria recorded pre-tax compensation expense related to RSUs for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 of $34 million, $31 million and $28 million, respectively. The deferred tax benefit recorded related to this compensation expense was $9 million, $8 million and $7 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The unamortized compensation expense related to RSUs was $59 million at December 31, 2021 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately two years.\n\nRSU activity was as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How does Coca-Cola's (KO) variable consideration model for bottlers impact the financial relationship between Coca-Cola and its bottling partners, and why might this model differ from PepsiCo's (PEP) approach despite both companies supplying to bottlers in the Consumer Staples sector?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) uses an incidence-based concentrate pricing model that ties the price charged to bottlers to factors such as the prices charged by bottlers for finished products, the sales channels, and package mix. This model incorporates variable consideration, which includes estimates based on customer sales volumes, inventories, selling prices, and pricing allowances. These estimates directly affect the net operating revenues and accounts receivable on KO\u2019s financial statements. In contrast, PepsiCo (PEP) does not provide specific details in the given excerpt about a similar variable pricing mechanism or financial arrangements with its bottlers. Therefore, while Coca-Cola explicitly structures its revenue recognition around dynamic, performance-linked variable terms with bottlers, PepsiCo\u2019s disclosed relationship lacks such detailed financial interdependence, suggesting a potentially different approach to supplier-bottler financial alignment.",

          "chunk_text": "Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with our customers are satisfied. Our performance obligation generally consists of the promise to sell concentrates, syrups or finished products to our bottling partners, wholesalers, distributors or retailers. Control of the concentrates, syrups or finished products is transferred upon shipment to, or receipt at, our customers' locations, as determined by the specific terms of the contract. Upon transfer of control to the customer, which completes our performance obligation, revenue is recognized. Our sales terms generally do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing defects on our part. After completion of our performance obligation, we have an unconditional right to consideration as outlined in the contract. Our receivables will generally be collected in less than six months, in accordance with the underlying payment terms. All of our performance obligations under the terms of contracts with our customers have an original duration of one year or less.\n\nOur customers and bottling partners may be entitled to cash discounts, funds for promotional and marketing activities, volumebased incentive programs, support for infrastructure programs and other similar programs. In most markets, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model. Under this model, the price we charge bottlers for concentrates they use to prepare and package finished products is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the prices charged by the bottlers for such finished products, the channels in which they are sold, and package mix. The amounts associated with the arrangements described above represent variable consideration, an estimate of which is included in the transaction price as a component of net operating revenues in our consolidated statement of income upon completion of our performance obligations. The total revenue recorded, including any variable consideration, cannot exceed the amount for which it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur when uncertainties related to variability are resolved. As a result, we are recognizing revenue based on our faithful depiction of the consideration that we expect to receive. In making our estimates of variable consideration, we consider past results and make significant assumptions related to: (1) customer sales volumes; (2) customer ending inventories; (3) customer selling price per unit; (4) selling channels; and (5) discount rates, rebates and other pricing allowances, as applicable. In gathering data to estimate our variable consideration, we generally calculate our estimates using a portfolio approach at the country and product line level rather than at the individual contract level. The result of making these estimates will impact the line items trade accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet. The actual amounts ultimately paid and/or received may be different from our estimates. The change in the amount of variable consideration recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021 related to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods was immaterial.\n\nThe following table presents net operating revenues disaggregated between the United States and International and further by line of business (in millions):\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Investments in Bottling Operations\n\nMost of our branded beverage products are prepared, packaged, distributed and sold by independent bottling partners. However, from time to time we acquire or take control of a bottling operation, often in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance. Owning a bottling operation enables us to compensate for limited local resources; help focus the bottler's sales and marketing programs; assist in the development of the bottler's business and information systems; and establish an appropriate capital structure for the bottler. In line with our long-term bottling strategy, we may periodically consider options for divesting or reducing our ownership interest in a consolidated bottling operation, typically by selling all or a portion of our interest in the bottling operation to an independent bottler to improve Coca-Cola system efficiency. When we sell a consolidated bottling operation to an independent bottling partner in which we have an equity method investment, our Company continues to participate in the bottler's results of operations through our share of the equity method investee's earnings or losses.\n\nIn addition, from time to time we make equity investments representing noncontrolling interests in selected bottling operations with the intention of maximizing the strength and efficiency of the Coca-Cola system's production, marketing, sales and distribution capabilities around the world by providing expertise and resources to strengthen those businesses. These investments are intended to result in increases in unit case volume, net revenues and profits at the bottler level, which in turn generate increased sales for our Company's concentrate operations. When our equity investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee bottler's operating and financial policies, we account for the investment under the equity method.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nSales of our ready-to-drink beverages are somewhat seasonal, with the second and third calendar quarters accounting for the highest sales volumes. The volume of sales in the beverage business may be affected by weather conditions.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe commercial beverage industry is highly competitive and consists of numerous companies, ranging from small or emerging to very large and well established. These include companies that, like our Company, compete globally in multiple geographic areas, as well as businesses that are primarily regional or local in operation. Competitive products include numerous nonalcoholic sparkling soft drinks; water products, including flavored and enhanced waters; juices, juice drinks and nectars; dilutables (including syrups and powders); coffees; teas; energy drinks; sports drinks; milk and other dairy-based drinks; plant-based beverages; functional beverages, including vitamin-based products and relaxation beverages; and various other nonalcoholic beverages. These competitive products are sold to consumers in both ready-to-drink and non-ready-to-drink form. The Company has directly entered the alcohol beverage segment in numerous markets outside the United States. In the United States, the Company has authorized alcohol-licensed third parties to use certain of our brands on alcohol beverages. Competitive products include all flavored alcohol beverages of varying alcohol bases. In many of the countries in which we do business, PepsiCo, Inc. is a primary competitor. Other significant competitors include, but are not limited to, Nestl\u00e9 S.A., Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., Danone S.A., Suntory Beverage &amp; Food Limited, Unilever, AB InBev, Kirin Holdings, Heineken N.V., Diageo and Red Bull GmbH. We also compete against numerous regional and local companies and, increasingly, against smaller companies that are developing microbrands and selling them directly to consumers through e-commerce retailers and other e-commerce platforms. In addition, in some markets, we compete against retailers that have developed their own store or private-label beverage brands.\n\nCompetitive factors impacting our business include, but are not limited to, pricing, advertising, sales promotion programs,     instore displays and point-of-sale marketing, digital marketing, product and ingredient innovation, increased efficiency in production techniques, the introduction of new packaging as well as new vending and dispensing equipment, contracting with marketing assets (theaters, sports arenas, universities, etc.), and brand and trademark development and protection.\n\nOur competitive strengths include leading brands with high levels of consumer recognition and loyalty; a worldwide network of bottlers and distributors of Company products; sophisticated marketing capabilities; and a talented group of dedicated employees. Our competitive challenges include strong competitors in all geographic regions; in many countries, a concentrated retail sector with powerful buyers able to freely choose among Company products, products of competitive beverage suppliers and individual retailers' own store or private-label beverage brands; new industry entrants; and dramatic shifts in consumer shopping methods and patterns due to a rapidly evolving digital landscape.\n\n## Raw Materials\n\nWater is a main ingredient in substantially all of our products. While historically we have not experienced significant water supply difficulties, water is a limited natural resource in many parts of the world, and our Company recognizes water availability, quality and sustainability, for both our operations and also the communities where we operate, as one of the key challenges facing our business.",

We normally grant our independent bottlers exclusive contracts to sell and manufacture certain beverage products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographic area. These arrangements provide us with the right to charge our independent bottlers for  concentrate,  finished  goods  and Aquafina  royalties  and  specify  the  manufacturing  process  required  for product quality. We also grant distribution rights to our independent bottlers for certain beverage products bearing our trademarks for specified geographic areas.\n\nWe rely on and provide financial incentives to our customers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our products to  the  consumer.  For  our  independent  distributors  and  retailers,  these  incentives  include  volumebased  rebates,  product  placement  fees,  promotions  and  displays.  For  our  independent  bottlers,  these incentives are referred to as bottler funding and are negotiated annually with each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs, such as consumer incentives, advertising support, new product support, and vending and cooler equipment placement. Consumer incentives include pricing discounts and promotions, and  other  promotional  offers.  Advertising  support  is  directed  at  advertising  programs  and  supporting independent bottler media. New product support includes targeted consumer and retailer incentives and direct marketplace  support,  such  as  point-of-purchase  materials,  product  placement  fees,  media  and  advertising. Vending  and  cooler  equipment  placement  programs  support  the  acquisition  and  placement  of  vending machines and cooler equipment. The nature and type of programs vary annually.\n\nChanges to the retail landscape, including increased consolidation of retail ownership, the continued growth of  sales  through  e-commerce  websites  and  mobile  commerce  applications,  including  through  subscription services  and  other  direct-to-consumer  businesses,  the  integration  of  physical  and  digital  operations  among retailers, as well as the international expansion of hard discounters, and the current economic environment, including in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, continue to increase the importance of major customers. In 2021,  sales  to  Walmart  Inc.  (Walmart)  and  its  affiliates,  including  Sam's  Club  (Sam's),  represented approximately 13% of our consolidated net revenue, with sales reported across all of our divisions, including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart. The loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our FLNA, QFNA and PBNA divisions.\n\n## Our Competition\n\nOur beverage and convenient food products are in highly competitive categories and markets and compete against products of international beverage and convenient food companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies,  as  well  as  regional,  local  and  private  label  manufacturers  and  economy  brands  and  other competitors, including smaller companies developing and selling micro brands directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms or through retailers focused on locally-sourced products. In many countries in which our  products  are  sold,  including  the  United  States,  The  Coca-Cola  Company  is  our  primary  beverage competitor. Other beverage and convenient food competitors include, but are not limited to, Campbell Soup Company, Conagra Brands, Inc., Hormel Foods Corporation, Kellogg Company, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., The Kraft  Heinz  Company,  Link  Snacks,  Inc.,  Mondel\u0113z  International,  Inc.,  Monster  Beverage  Corporation, Nestl\u00e9 S.A., Red Bull GmbH and Utz Brands, Inc.\n\nMany of our convenient food products hold significant leadership positions in the convenient food industry in the United States and worldwide. In 2021, we and The Coca-Cola Company represented approximately 22% and 19%, respectively, of the U.S. liquid refreshment beverage category by estimated retail sales in measured channels, according to Information Resources, Inc.

      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) relies heavily on bottling partners, some of which it accounts for under the equity method, and includes their income or loss proportionally in its operating results. A deterioration in the financial condition of these bottling partners could adversely affect KO's net operating revenues and result in equity income decreases or impairments. In contrast, PepsiCo (PEP) directly organizes its beverage business in the U.S. and Canada under the PBNA division, indicating a more vertically integrated and internally controlled approach to bottling operations.

          "chunk_text": "concentrates and syrups, our ability to do so may be materially limited by our bottling partners' financial condition and their ability to pass price increases along to their customers. In addition, we have investments in certain of our bottling partners, which we account for under the equity method, and our operating results include our proportionate share of such bottling partners' income or loss. Our bottling partners' financial condition is affected in large part by conditions and events that are beyond our and their control, including competitive and general market conditions; the availability of capital and other financing resources on reasonable terms; loss of major customers; changes in or additional regulations; or disruptions of bottling operations that may be caused by strikes, work stoppages, labor unrest, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. A deterioration of the financial condition or results of operations of one or more of our major bottling partners could adversely affect our net operating revenues from sales of concentrates and syrups; and, if such deterioration involves one or more of our equity method investee bottling partners, it could also result in a decrease in our equity income and/or impairments of our equity method investments.\n\n## We may from time to time engage in refranchising activities or divestitures of certain brands or businesses, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\nAs part of our strategic initiative to focus on our core business of building brands and leading our system of bottling partners, we continue to seek opportunities to refranchise our consolidated bottling operations. Our refranchising activities require significant attention and effort on the part of, and therefore may be a distraction for, senior management. If we are unable to complete future refranchising transactions on terms and conditions favorable to us, or if our refranchising partners are not efficient or not aligned with our long-term vision for the Coca-Cola system, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Additionally, we have divested and may in the future divest certain brands or businesses. These divestitures may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition if we are unable to offset impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested brands or businesses, or if we are otherwise unable to achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from such divestitures.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO REGULATORY AND LEGAL MATTERS\n\nIncreases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws, regulations or unfavorable resolutions of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\n\nWe are subject to income tax in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions in which we generate profits. Our overall effective income tax rate is a function of applicable local tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate, tax treaties between such jurisdictions, and the geographic mix of our income before income taxes, which is itself impacted by currency movements. Consequently, the isolated or combined effects of unfavorable movements in tax rates, geographic mix or foreign exchange rates could reduce our net income. Tax laws and regulations, including rates of taxation, are subject to revision by individual taxing jurisdictions which may result from multilateral agreements. Many jurisdictions have enacted legislation and adopted policies resulting from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's ('OECD') anti-Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project. The OECD is currently coordinating a project on behalf of the G20 and other participating countries which would grant additional taxing rights over profits earned by multinational enterprises to the countries in which their products are sold and services rendered. A second pillar would establish a global per-country minimum tax of 15 percent. It is possible that the adoption of these or other proposals could have a material impact on our net income and cash flows. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions, estimates and accruals. The results of audits or related disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made and for periods for which the statute of limitations is open.\n\nFor instance, the United States Internal Revenue Service ('IRS') is seeking to increase our U.S. taxable income for tax years 2007 through 2009 by an amount that creates a potential additional U.S. federal income tax liability of approximately $3.3 billion for that period, plus interest. The Company firmly believes that the IRS' claims are without merit and is pursuing, and will continue to pursue, all available administrative and judicial remedies necessary to vigorously defend its position. On November 18, 2020, the U.S. Tax Court ('Tax Court') issued an opinion ('Opinion') predominantly siding with the IRS. Although the Company disagrees with the unfavorable portions of the Opinion and intends to vigorously defend its position, considering all avenues of appeal, there is no assurance that the courts will ultimately rule in the Company's favor. It is therefore possible that all or some of the unfavorable portions of the Opinion could ultimately be upheld. In that event, the Company would be subject to significant additional liabilities for the years at issue and potentially also for the subsequent years if the unfavorable portions of the Opinion were to be applied to the foreign licensees covered within the scope of the Opinion. Moreover, the IRS could successfully appeal the portions of the Opinion that are favorable to the Company and/or assert new claims for additional tax relating to the subsequent years by broadening the scope to cover additional foreign licensees. These adjustments could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Any such adjustments related to years prior to 2018, either in the litigation period or thereafter, may also have an impact on the",

      "question": "How do credit rating agencies incorporate bottler financial performance into Coca-Cola's credit rating assessment, and why might this exposure differ for PepsiCo given its supplier relationship with bottlers as described in their respective 10-K filings?",
      "answer": "Credit rating agencies incorporate the financial performance of Coca-Cola's (KO) bottlers, such as CCEP and Coca-Cola FEMSA, into KO's credit rating assessment because of their strategic importance to the business model. KO expects rating agencies to continue considering bottler financials, and a decline in bottler credit ratings could reduce KO's equity income due to higher interest expenses for those bottlers. In contrast, PepsiCo (PEP) has a supplier relationship with bottlers, which implies a different type of financial exposure. While KO has no legal obligation for bottler debt, the strategic alignment creates an incentive to support bottler viability. PEP's supplier relationship suggests it may not face the same type of equity income risk from bottler financial performance, but instead could experience revenue impacts based on bottler demand for its products.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From KO's 10-K, we learn that rating agencies consider the financial information of certain bottlers (e.g., CCEP, Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc., Coca-Cola FEMSA, and Coca-Cola Hellenic) when assessing KO\u2019s credit strength.",
        "Step 2: KO explicitly states that if bottlers\u2019 credit ratings decline, KO\u2019s equity income could be reduced due to higher interest expenses for those bottlers, indicating a financial exposure.",
        "Step 3: PEP\u2019s relationship with bottlers is described as a supplier relationship, which implies a different type of financial linkage \u2014 one where PEP\u2019s exposure would be more directly tied to changes in bottler demand for PEP\u2019s products rather than equity income or credit rating spillovers.",
        "Step 4: Therefore, while KO\u2019s credit rating assessment includes bottler financials due to strategic importance, PEP\u2019s exposure is likely more transactional and revenue-linked rather than equity-linked."

We use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners' equity. This exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. Our interest expense may also be affected by our credit ratings.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, our long-term debt was rated 'A+' by Standard &amp; Poor's and 'A1' by Moody's. Our commercial paper program was rated 'A-1' by Standard &amp; Poor's and 'P-1' by Moody's. In assessing our credit strength, both rating agencies consider our capital structure (including the amount and maturity dates of our debt) and financial policies as well as the consolidated balance sheet and other financial information of the Company. In addition, certain rating agencies also consider the financial information of certain bottlers, including CCEP, Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc., Coca-Cola FEMSA and Coca-Cola Hellenic. While the Company has no legal obligation for the debt of these bottlers, the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the Company's business model provides the Company with an incentive to keep these bottlers viable. It is our expectation that these rating agencies will continue using this methodology. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure, our major bottlers' financial performance, changes in the credit rating agencies' methodology in assessing our credit strength, or for any other reason, our cost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if certain bottlers' credit ratings were to decline, the Company's equity income could be reduced as a result of the potential increase in interest expense for those bottlers.\n\nWe monitor our financial ratios and, as indicated above, the rating agencies consider these ratios in assessing our credit ratings. Each rating agency employs a different aggregation methodology and has different thresholds for the various financial ratios. These thresholds are not necessarily permanent, nor are they always fully disclosed to our Company.\n\nOur global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the world, enabling us to borrow funds at a low effective cost. This posture, coupled with active management of our mix of short-term and long-term debt as well as our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, results in a lower overall cost of borrowing. Our debt management policies, in conjunction with our share repurchase program and investment activity, can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets.",

Target (TGT) includes Hair Care as part of its broader Beauty and Personal Care category, which also includes skin and bath care, cosmetics, oral care, deodorant, and shaving products. Since Hair Care is only one component of this category and is listed alongside several other product lines, its relative contribution to TGT's overall merchandise mix is likely smaller than PG's 9%.

Business.\n\nThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company (the Company) is a world-leading multinational consumer goods company focused on providing trusted, branded products of superior quality, performance and value to improve the lives of consumers around the world - now and for generations to come. Our products are sold in about 180 countries and territories throughout the world. The Company was incorporated in Ohio in 1905, having first been established as a New Jersey corporation in 1890, and was built from a business founded in Cincinnati in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble.\n\nAdditional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&amp;A); and Notes 1 and 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms \"Company,\" \"P&amp;G ,\" \"we,\" \"our\" or \"us\" as used herein refer to The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (the registrant) and its subsidiaries. Throughout this Form 10-K, we incorporate by reference information from other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments thereto, are filed electronically with the SEC. The SEC maintains an internet site that contains these reports at: www.sec.gov. Reports can also be accessed and downloaded through links from our website at: www.pginvestor.com.

Copies of these reports are also available, without charge, by contacting EQ Shareowner Services, 1100 Centre Pointe Curve, Suite 101, Mendota, MN 55120-4100.\n\n## Financial Information about Segments\n\nInformation about our reportable segments can be found in the MD&amp;A and Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Narrative Description of Business\n\nBusiness Model . Our business model is focused on delivering sustainable value creation by driving balanced top- and bottom-line growth. We create, manufacture, market and distribute a diversified portfolio of daily-use products to delight consumers with irresistible superiority across five key vectors - product performance, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and value. We invest in research and development and consumer insights to invent new categories or products and innovate our existing products, ensuring they meet evolving consumer needs and preferences. We leverage marketing strategies including advertising, promotions and endorsements to drive brand awareness and loyalty among consumers. The Company utilizes various distribution channels, including retail stores, e-commerce platforms and direct-to-consumer platforms to deliver our products. Our business model relies on continued productivity improvements to fuel investments in R&amp;D and  marketing  and  deliver  value  creation.  Our  objective  is  to  deliver  sustainable  and  balanced  top-  and  bottom-line  growth  while  serving  the  needs  of  all stakeholders - consumers, customers, employees, society and shareowners.\n\nKey Product Categories . Information on key product categories can be found in the MD&amp;A and Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nKey Customers . Our customers include mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores and professional channels. We also sell direct to consumers. Sales to Walmart Inc. and its affiliates represent approximately 16% of our total sales in 2024 and 15% in 2023 and 2022. No other customer represents more than 10% of our total sales. Our top ten customers accounted for 42% of our total net sales in 2024, 40% in 2023 and 39% in 2022.\n\nSources and Availability of M aterials . Almost all of the raw and packaging materials used by the Company are purchased from third parties, some of whom are single-source  suppliers.  We  produce  certain  raw  materials,  primarily  chemicals,  for  further  use  in  the  manufacturing  process.  In  addition,  fuel,  natural  gas  and derivative products are important commodities consumed in our manufacturing processes and in the transportation of input materials and finished products. The prices we pay for materials and other commodities are subject to fluctuation. When prices for these items change, we may or may not pass the change to our customers. The Company purchases a substantial variety of other raw and packaging materials, none of which are material to our business taken as a whole.\n\nTrademarks and Patents . We own or have rights to patents and trademarks, which are used in connection with our activity in all businesses. Our patents cover a range of product features, including significant product formulation and processes used to manufacture our products. The trademarks are important to the overall marketing and branding of our products. In part, our success can be attributed to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks and patents.\n\nCompetitive Condition .  The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. Our products compete against similar products from a broad range of companies, both large and small, both established and new, including well-known global competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. In this highly competitive setting, we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. Our integrated strategy and our focus on driving superiority across product, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and value are key differentiators in the marketplace.",

Changes in any of those factors could change our effectiv e tax rate, which could adv ersely affect our net earnings. In addition, changes in our operations both in and outside of the U.S. may cause greater v olatility in our effectiv e tax rate. Furthermore, we are subject to regular rev iews and ongoing audits by both domestic and international tax authorities. Although we believ e our tax positions and estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome could differ significantly from our recorded tax amounts and could adv ersely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nIf we are unable to access the capital markets or obtain bank credit, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer.\n\nWe are  dependent  on  a  stable,  liquid,  and  well-functioning  financial  system  to  fund  our  operations  and  capital  inv estments.  Our  continued  access  to financial  markets  depends  on  multiple  factors  including  the  condition  of  debt  capital  markets,  the  condition  of  the  banking  sector,  our  operating performance, and our credit ratings. If rating agencies lower our credit ratings, it could adv ersely affect our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds, and other terms for new debt issuances and borrowings. Each of the credit rating agencies rev iews its rating periodically, and there is no guarantee that our current credit ratings will remain the same. In addition, we use a v ariety of deriv ativ e products to manage our exposure to market risk, principally interest rate fluctuations. Disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets could reduce our ability to fund our operations and capital inv estments and lead to losses on deriv ativ e positions from counterparty failures, which could adv ersely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIf we fail to achieve our projected results or otherwise fail to meet market expectations regarding our financial performance, the price and volatility of our s tock could be adversely affected.\n\nOur results of operations hav e prev iously fluctuated from quarter to quarter, sometimes significantly, and may do so again in the future. If we fail to achiev e our projected results, if our guidance is not aligned with market expectations, if we modify our guidance, if we modify our share repurchase program or our approach to div idend distributions, or if we fail to meet the expectations of inv estors or securities analysts, our stock price may decline (as it has at times in recent  years),  and  the  decrease  in  the  stock  price  may  be  disproportionate  to  any  shortfall  in  our  financial  performance. Additionally,  factors  such  as performance results for our competitors and news or announcements by us, our competitors, and other third parties (including gov ernmental entities and officials and non-gov ernmental organizations) may result in a decline and v olatility in our stock price.\n\n## Item 1B.

      "question": "How do Procter & Gamble's and Target's exposures to tax policy changes differ in terms of their financial and operational risks, based on their respective supply chain dependencies and regulatory environments?",
      "answer": "Procter & Gamble (PG) faces exposure to tax policy changes primarily through its global regulatory environment, which includes managing changes in applicable tax laws and regulations as part of its broader set of financial and operational risks. This exposure is embedded within a comprehensive list of risk factors, including the ability to manage global financial risks, geopolitical conditions, and regulatory compliance across multiple jurisdictions. In contrast, Target (TGT) is exposed to tax policy changes through its supply chain dependencies, particularly because a significant portion of its merchandise is sourced internationally, with China being its largest source. Changes in U.S. tax or trade policy, such as the imposition of tariffs on Chinese imports, could result in substantial additional procurement costs for Target and may require it to raise prices on certain products, directly affecting its competitive position and profitability. While PG's exposure is more regulatory and strategic in nature, TGT's is more operationally and cost-transactional, tied directly to import costs and pricing strategy.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - PG mentions 'the ability to manage changes in applicable tax laws and regulations' as one of its key risk factors.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - TGT states that 'any trade disputes or changes in tax or trade policy between the U.S. and countries from which we source merchandise... could require us to take certain actions, including raising prices on products we sell.'",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - PG's exposure to tax policy changes is embedded in a broader regulatory compliance context, while TGT's is directly tied to supply chain cost impacts and pricing decisions due to international sourcing, especially from China."

          "chunk_text": "## Supply Chain and Third-Party Risks\n\nChanges in our relationships with our vendors or other companies, changes in tax or trade policy, interruptions in our operations or supply chain, and increased commodity or supply chain costs could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.\n\nWe are dependent on our vendors, independent contractors, and other third parties (including common carriers) to supply merchandise to our distribution centers, stores, and guests. If our replenishment and fulfillment network does not operate properly, if we are unable to timely import certain merchandise, if a v endor fails to deliv er on its commitments, or if common carriers hav e difficulty prov iding capacity to meet demands for their serv ices like they experienced in recent years, we could experience merchandise out-of-stocks, delays in shipping and receiv ing merchandise, and increased costs, which could adv ersely affect our reputation and results of operations. In addition, we hav e consumer-facing relationships with a v ariety of other companies, including Apple, CVS, Disney, Lev i's, Starbucks, and Ulta Beauty. Any termination of, or adv erse change in, our relationship with any of these companies could decrease our sales, increase our costs, and negativ ely impact our reputation and results of operations.\n\nA significant portion of the merchandise that we offer is sourced, directly or indirectly, from outside the U.S., with China as our single largest source of merchandise we import. Any trade disputes or changes in tax or trade policy between the U.S. and countries from which we source merchandise, such as the imposition of additional tariffs or duties on imported products, could require us to take certain actions, including raising prices on products we sell and seeking alternativ e  sources  of  supply  from  v endors  in  other  countries.  In  particular ,  recent  U.S.  tariffs  imposed  or  threatened  to  be  imposed  on  China, Mexico, Canada, and other countries and any retaliatory actions taken by such countries could result in us incurring substantial additional costs to procure a large portion of the merchandise we offer and may require us to raise prices on certain products. In addition, if our competitors do not keep pace with any such price increases or are able to offset the impact of tariffs through other actions, our competitiv e position may be adv ersely affected. Any of these outcomes could adversely affect our reputation, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\nPolitical or economic uncertainty or instability, trade policies, disputes, or sanctions, currency fluctuations, the outbreak of pandemics or other illnesses, labor shortages, labor unrest or strikes, transport capacity and costs, inflation, port security, weather conditions, natural disasters, geopolitical conflicts, social unrest, terrorist attacks, armed conflicts, or other ev ents that hav e affected, and could in the future affect, foreign trade are beyond our control. T hese types of ev ents hav e impacted us, and could impact us in the future, including by disrupting our supply of merchandise, increasing the price and limiting the availability of raw materials, increasing our costs, and adv ersely affecting our results of operations. For example, there hav e been periodic closings and ship div ersions, armed conflicts, unrest, labor disputes, and congestion disrupting railways, trucking, waterways, and ports around the world, including at major U.S. ports where we receiv e a significant portion of the products we source from outside the U.S. We hav e from time to time made alternativ e arrangements to continue the flow of inv entory as a result of supply chain disruptions in the U.S. and other countries. If these types of ev ents recur and impact any of the locations or modes of transportation that we depend on, it could increase our costs and adv ersely affect our supply of inv entory. In addition, prices of fuel and  other  commodities  on  which  our  supply  chain  depends  are  historically  v olatile  and  subject  to  fluctuations  based  on  a  v ariety  of  international  and domestic factors. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices, as hav e occurred in recent years, could further increase our costs and adv ersely affect our results of operations.\n\nIf s ervices  we obtain from third parties are unavailable, fail to meet our standards, or increase in cost, our reputation, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\nWe  rely  on  third  parties  to  support  our  business  operations,  including  portions  of  our  technology  infrastructure,  digital  platforms,  replenishment  and fulfillment operations, store and supply chain infrastructure, deliv ery serv ices (including by independent contractors v ia our Shipt subsidiary), guest contact centers, payment processing, and extensions of credit for our T arget-branded payment card program. If we are unable to contract with third parties hav ing the specialized skills needed to support our operations (including as a result of any labor disputes or labor unav ailability at such third parties), if any thirdparty serv ices are interrupted, or if they fail to meet our performance standards, then our reputation and results of operations could be adv ersely affected.",

      "answer": "The U.S. Tax Reform impacts both MDLZ and WMT in distinct financial ways. For MDLZ, the reform led to excess foreign tax credits generated by deemed repatriation, resulting in a significant U.S. valuation allowance. Specifically, the U.S. valuation allowance mainly relates to $2,935 million in pre-tax loss carryforwards, with $171 million set to expire between 2022 and 2041, and the remaining $2,764 million being carried forward indefinitely. For WMT, the U.S. Tax Reform eliminated federal taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings, influencing its strategy to repatriate earnings from jurisdictions outside the U.S. As of January 31, 2022, WMT had $4.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents that may not be freely transferable to the U.S., with $2.2 billion of that amount subject to approval by Flipkart minority shareholders for access via dividends or intercompany financing arrangements.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are impacted by U.S. Tax Reform, but in different ways: MDLZ faces valuation allowance issues due to deemed repatriation, while WMT benefits from tax-free repatriation but faces logistical constraints in accessing foreign-held cash."

Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2022 decreased when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily due to an increase in inventory costs and purchases to support strong sales and lapping the impact of accelerated inventory sell-through in fiscal 2021, as well as timing and payment of wages. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2021, when compared to the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to the impact of the global health crisis which accelerated inventory sell-through, as well as the timing and payment of inventory purchases, incremental COVID-19 related expenses and certain benefit payments.\n\n## Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $14.8 billion and $17.7 billion as of January 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our working capital deficit, defined as total current assets less total current liabilities, was $6.3 billion and $2.6 billion as of January 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases.\n\nWe use intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible. Additionally, from time-to-time, we repatriate earnings and related cash from jurisdictions outside of the U.S.  Historically, U.S. taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings. Due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform, repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of U.S. federal tax, but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes. While we are currently evaluating recent regulations issued from the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") and the U.S. Treasury Department, we do not expect current local laws, other existing limitations on anticipated future repatriations of cash amounts held outside the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial position or results of operations.\n\nAs of January 31, 2022 and 2021, cash and cash equivalents of $4.3 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions.

The non-recurring fair value measurement is classified as Level 3 as no fair value inputs are observable. As the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable in most of our leases, we use our countryspecific incremental borrowing rate based on the lease term using information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Many of our leases contain non-lease components (e.g. product costs, common-area or other maintenance costs) that relate to the lease components of the agreement. Nonlease components and the lease components to which they relate are accounted for as a single lease component.\n\nAmortization of ROU lease assets is calculated on a straight-line basis over the lease term with the expense recorded in cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses depending on the nature of the leased item. Interest expense is recorded over the lease term and is recorded in interest expense (based on a front-loaded interest expense pattern) for finance leases and is recorded in cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses (on a straight-line basis) for operating leases. All operating lease cash payments and interest on finance leases are recorded within cash flows from operating activities and all finance lease principal payments are recorded within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n## Software Costs:\n\nWe capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software, which do not exceed seven years.\n\n## Goodwill and Indefinite-Life Intangible Assets:\n\nWe test goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on July 1. We assess goodwill impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entity-specific, industry, market and general economic factors affecting our goodwill reporting units. We review our operating segment and reporting unit structure for goodwill testing annually or as significant changes in the organization occur. Annually, we may perform qualitative testing, or depending on factors such as prior-year test results, current year developments, current risk evaluations and other practical considerations, we may elect to do quantitative testing instead. In our quantitative testing, we compare a reporting unit's estimated fair value with its carrying value. We estimate a reporting unit's fair value using a discounted cash flow method that incorporates planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of residual value. In 2021, we performed a quantitative annual test. For our Europe and North America reporting units, we used a marketbased, weighted-average cost of capital of 6.4% to discount the projected cash flows of those operations, and for our Latin America and AMEA reporting units, we used a risk-rated discount rate of 9.4%. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, industry and economic conditions, and our actual results and conditions may differ over time. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's net assets exceeds its fair value, we would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's fair value.\n\nAnnually we assess indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of these intangible assets. If significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset, we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value with its carrying value. We determine estimated fair value using estimates of future sales, earnings growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value, we consider the asset impaired and reduce its carrying value to the estimated fair value. We amortize definite-life intangible assets over their estimated useful lives and evaluate them for impairment as we do other long-lived assets.",

The quantitative test for goodwill impairment is performed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units. Fair value is measured based on the discounted cash flow method and relative market-based approaches.

In contrast, WMT evaluated its reporting units (Walmart U.S., Walmart International, and Sam\u2019s Club) and determined that the fair value of each was significantly greater than the carrying amount, but it did not specify distinct discount rates for different regions.

The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements. We have discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our Audit Committee. The following is a review of our most significant assumptions and estimates.\n\n## Goodwill and Indefinite-Life Intangible Assets :\n\nWe test goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on July 1. We assess goodwill impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entity-specific, industry, market and general economic factors affecting our goodwill reporting units. We review our operating segment and reporting unit structure for goodwill testing annually or as significant changes in the organization occur. Annually, we may perform qualitative testing, or depending on factors such as prior-year test results, current year developments, current risk evaluations and other practical considerations, we may elect to do quantitative testing instead. In our quantitative testing, we compare a reporting unit's estimated fair value with its carrying value. We estimate a reporting unit's fair value using a discounted cash flow method which incorporates planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of residual value. This year, for our Europe and North America reporting units, we used a market-based, weighted-average cost of capital of 6.4% to discount the projected cash flows of those operations. For our Latin America and AMEA reporting units, we used a risk-rated discount rate of 9.4%. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and industry and economic conditions based on available information. Given the uncertainty of the global economic environment and the impact of COVID-19, those estimates could be significantly different than future performance. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's net assets exceeds its fair value, we would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's fair value.\n\nIn 2021, 2020 and 2019, there were no impairments of goodwill. In connection with our 2021 annual impairment testing, each of our reporting units had sufficient fair value in excess of carrying value. While all reporting units passed our annual impairment testing, if planned business performance expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then the estimated fair values of a reporting unit or reporting units might decline and lead to a goodwill impairment in the future.\n\nAnnually, we assess indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of these assets. If significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset, we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value with its carrying value. We determine estimated fair value using planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of royalty rates. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, the asset is impaired and its carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value.\n\nDuring 2021, we recorded $32 million of intangible asset impairment charges related to a biscuit brand in North America. The impairment charges were calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the intangible assets on a global basis and were recorded within asset impairment and exit costs. We use several accepted valuation methods, including relief of royalty, excess earnings and excess margin, that utilize estimates of future sales, earnings growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates in determining a brand's global fair value. We also identified eight brands with $1,146 million of aggregate book value as of December 31, 2021 that each had a fair value in excess of book value of 10% or less. We continue to monitor our brand performance, particularly in light of the significant uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related impacts to our business. If the brand earnings expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future. In 2020, we recorded $144 million of intangible asset impairment charges related to gum, chocolate, biscuits and candy brands, with $83 million in North America, $53 million in Europe, $5 million in AMEA and $3 million in Latin America. In 2019, we recorded $57 million of intangible asset impairment charges related to gum, chocolate, biscuits and candy brands, with $39 million in Europe, $15 million in AMEA and $3 million in Latin America.\n\nRefer to Note 6, Goodwill and Intangible Assets , for additional information.",

This reveals that while Colgate focuses on internal cost optimization, PepsiCo aligns its adaptation strategy with sustainability goals, showing differing approaches to the same macro condition.",

Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute  and  sell  a  wide  variety  of  beverages  and  convenient  foods,  serving  customers  and  consumers  in more than 200 countries and territories.\n\nAs a global company with deep local ties, we faced many of the same challenges in 2021 as our consumers, customers,  and  competitors  across  the  world,  including  the  second  year  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic;  a worsening climate crisis; supply chain disruptions; inflationary pressures; shifting consumer preferences and behaviors;  a  highly  competitive  operating  environment;  a  rapidly  changing  retail  landscape,  including  the growth  in  e-commerce;  continued  macroeconomic  and  political  volatility;  and  an  evolving  regulatory landscape.\n\nTo meet the challenges of today - and those of tomorrow - we are driven by an approach called PepsiCo Positive (pep+). pep+ is a strategic end-to-end transformation of our business, with sustainability at the center of  how  the  company  will  strive  to  create  growth  and  value  by  operating  within  planetary  boundaries  and inspiring  positive  change  for  the  planet  and  people.  pep+  will  guide  how  we  will  work  to  transform  our business operations, from sourcing ingredients and making and selling products in a more sustainable way, to leveraging our more than one billion connections with consumers each day to take sustainability mainstream and engage people to make choices that are better for themselves and the planet.\n\npep+ drives action and progress across three key pillars, bringing together a number of industry-leading 2030 sustainability goals under a comprehensive framework:\n\n- Positive Agriculture : We are working to spread regenerative practices to restore the Earth across land equal  to  the  company's  entire  agricultural  footprint  (approximately  7  million  acres),  sustainably source  key  crops  and  ingredients,  and  improve  the  livelihoods  of  more  people  in  our  agricultural supply chain.\n- Positive Value Chain : We are working to build a circular and inclusive value chain through actions to:  achieve  net-zero  emissions  by  2040;  become  net  water  positive  by  2030;  and  introduce  more sustainable  packaging  into  the  value  chain.  Our  packaging  goals  include  cutting  virgin  plastic  per serving,  using  recycled  content  in  our  plastic  packaging,  and  scaling  our  SodaStream  business globally,  an  innovative  platform  that  almost  entirely  eliminates  the  need  for  beverage  packaging, among  other  levers.

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive supplies products to traditional retailers, which are a key part of its distribution network, while PepsiCo depends on these same traditional retailers to sell its products. Both companies face risks as the retail landscape evolves, with traditional retailers losing market share to e-commerce platforms. PepsiCo specifically notes that if traditional retailers lose significant market share to e-commerce or fail to develop digital tools to compete, its business could be adversely affected. Similarly, since Colgate-Palmolive sells a significant portion of its products through these traditional retailers, a decline in their competitiveness could reduce Colgate\u2019s sales volume and revenue. Therefore, the shared reliance on traditional retail channels creates a mutual vulnerability to the ongoing shift toward e-commerce.",

Our  business  will  be  adversely  affected  if  we  are  unable  to  maintain  and  develop  successful relationships with e-commerce retailers and hard discounters, while also maintaining relationships with our key customers operating in traditional retail channels (many of whom are also focused on increasing their ecommerce sales). Our business can be adversely affected if e-commerce channels and hard discounters take significant  additional  market  share  away  from  traditional  retailers  or  we  fail  to  find  ways  to  create increasingly  better  digital  tools  and  capabilities  for  our  retail  customers  to  enable  them  to  grow  their businesses. In addition, our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to profitably expand our own direct-to-consumer e-commerce capabilities. The retail industry is also impacted by increased consolidation of ownership and purchasing power, particularly in North America, Europe and Latin America, resulting in large retailers or buying groups with increased purchasing power, impacting our ability to compete in these areas. Consolidation also adversely impacts our smaller customers' ability to compete effectively, resulting in an inability on their part to pay for our products or reduced or canceled orders of our products. Further, we must  maintain  mutually  beneficial  relationships  with  our  key  customers,  including  Walmart,  to  compete effectively. Any  inability  to  resolve  a  significant  dispute  with  any  of  our  key  customers,  a  change  in  the business condition (financial or otherwise) of any of our key customers, even if unrelated to us, a significant reduction  in  sales  to  any  key  customer,  or  the  loss  of  any  of  our  key  customers  can  adversely  affect  our business.\n\n## Disruption of our manufacturing operations or supply chain, including increased commodity, packaging, transportation, labor and other input costs, can adversely affect our business.\n\nWe  have  experienced  and  could  continue  to  experience  disruption  in  our  manufacturing  operations  and supply chain. Many of the raw materials and supplies used in the production of our products are sourced from countries  experiencing  civil  unrest,  political  instability  or  unfavorable  economic  conditions.  Some  raw materials and supplies, including packaging materials, are available only from a limited number of suppliers or from a sole supplier or are in short supply when seasonal demand is at its peak. There can be no assurance that  we  will  be  able  to  maintain  favorable  arrangements  and  relationships  with  suppliers  or  that  our contingency plans will be effective to prevent disruptions that may arise from shortages or discontinuation of any  raw  materials  and  other  supplies  that  we  use  in  the  manufacture,  production  and  distribution  of  our products. Any sustained or significant disruption to the manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials could increase our costs and interrupt product supply, which can adversely impact our business.\n\nThe raw materials and other supplies, including agricultural commodities, fuel and packaging materials, such as  recycled  PET,  transportation,  labor  and  other  supply  chain  inputs  that  we  use  for  the  manufacturing, production  and  distribution  of  our  products  are  subject  to  price  volatility  and  fluctuations  in  availability caused by many factors, including changes in supply and demand, supplier capacity constraints, inflation, weather  conditions  (including  potential  effects  of  climate  change),  fire,  natural  disasters,  disease  or  pests (including the impact of greening disease on the citrus industry), agricultural uncertainty, health epidemics or pandemics  or  other  contagious  outbreaks  (including  COVID-19),  labor  shortages  (including  the  lack  of availability of truck drivers or as a result of COVID-19), strikes or work stoppages, governmental incentives and controls (including import/export restrictions, such as new or increased tariffs, sanctions, quotas or trade barriers), port  congestions  or  delays,  transport  capacity  constraints,  cybersecurity  incidents  or  other disruptions,  loss  or  impairment  of  key  manufacturing  sites,  political  uncertainties,  acts  of  terrorism, governmental instability or currency exchange rates. Many of our raw materials and supplies are purchased in the open market and the prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation.

We are also seeking to maximize the impact of our ESG programs and leading in the development of human capital, including our sustainability and social impact and DE&amp;I strategies, which we are working to integrate across our organization. We are strengthening our capabilities in areas such as innovation, digital, eCommerce and data and analytics enabling us to be more responsive in today's rapidly changing world. In particular, we believe our digital transformation is of paramount importance to our success going forward. We continue to invest behind our brands, including through advertising, and to develop initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental, veterinary and skin health professionals and traditional and eCommerce retailers. We also continue to broaden our eCommerce offerings, including direct-to-consumer and subscription services. We continue to believe that growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for our products.\n\nWe are also changing the way we work to drive growth and how we approach innovation with focus, empowerment, experimentation and digitization to respond to the dynamic retail landscape and the evolving preferences of our customers and consumers. The retail landscape, the ease of new entrants into the market in many of our categories and the evolving preferences of our customers and consumers demand that we work differently and faster in an agile, authentic and culturally relevant manner to drive innovation.\n\nThe investments needed to drive growth are supported through continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. Through these initiatives, which are referred to as our funding-the-growth initiatives, we seek to become even more effective and efficient throughout our businesses. These initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses, distribution and logistics and advertising and promotional materials, among other things, and encompass a wide range of projects, examples of which include raw material substitution, reduction of packaging materials, consolidating suppliers to leverage volumes and increasing manufacturing efficiency through SKU reductions and formulation simplification. We also continue to prioritize our investments in high growth segments within our Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition businesses, including by expanding our portfolio in premium skin health.\n\nOn January 27, 2022, the Board approved a targeted productivity program (the '2022 Global Productivity Initiative'). The program is intended to reallocate resources towards our strategic priorities and faster growth businesses, drive efficiencies in our operations and streamline our supply chain to reduce structural costs. Implementation of the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, which is expected to be substantially completed by December 31, 2022, is projected to result in cumulative pre-tax charges, once all phases are approved and implemented, totaling between $200 and $240, which are currently estimated to be comprised of the following: employee-related costs, including severance, pension and other termination benefits (80%); asset-related costs, primarily accelerated depreciation and asset write-downs (10%); and other charges (10%), which include contract termination costs, consisting primarily of implementation-related charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies. It is estimated that approximately 90% of the charges will result in cash expenditures. For more information regarding the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, see 'Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges' below.\n\n## Significant Items Impacting Comparability\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a non-cash charge of $571 pretax ($518 aftertax) to adjust the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible related to the Filorga skin health business. The impairment was due primarily to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Filorga business as a result of government restrictions and reduced consumer mobility, which negatively impacted consumption in the duty-free, travel retail and pharmacy channels. See Note 5, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\n\nIn 1990, our Canadian subsidiary ('CP Canada'), issued C$145 of Canadian dollar-denominated unsecured unsubordinated 12.85% guaranteed notes due October 4, 2030 (the 'Canada notes'). In the third quarter of 2021, CP Canada redeemed the Canada notes and recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $75 pretax ($55 aftertax), which is included in Interest (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income, representing the difference between the redemption price and the carrying amount of the debt extinguished.",

In addition, our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to profitably expand our own direct-to-consumer e-commerce capabilities. The retail industry is also impacted by increased consolidation of ownership and purchasing power, particularly in North America, Europe and Latin America, resulting in large retailers or buying groups with increased purchasing power, impacting our ability to compete in these areas. Consolidation also adversely impacts our smaller customers' ability to compete effectively, resulting in an inability on their part to pay for our products or reduced or canceled orders of our products. Further, we must  maintain  mutually  beneficial  relationships  with  our  key  customers,  including  Walmart,  to  compete effectively. Any  inability  to  resolve  a  significant  dispute  with  any  of  our  key  customers,  a  change  in  the business condition (financial or otherwise) of any of our key customers, even if unrelated to us, a significant reduction  in  sales  to  any  key  customer,  or  the  loss  of  any  of  our  key  customers  can  adversely  affect  our business.\n\n## Disruption of our manufacturing operations or supply chain, including increased commodity, packaging, transportation, labor and other input costs, can adversely affect our business.\n\nWe  have  experienced  and  could  continue  to  experience  disruption  in  our  manufacturing  operations  and supply chain. Many of the raw materials and supplies used in the production of our products are sourced from countries  experiencing  civil  unrest,  political  instability  or  unfavorable  economic  conditions.  Some  raw materials and supplies, including packaging materials, are available only from a limited number of suppliers or from a sole supplier or are in short supply when seasonal demand is at its peak. There can be no assurance that  we  will  be  able  to  maintain  favorable  arrangements  and  relationships  with  suppliers  or  that  our contingency plans will be effective to prevent disruptions that may arise from shortages or discontinuation of any  raw  materials  and  other  supplies  that  we  use  in  the  manufacture,  production  and  distribution  of  our products. Any sustained or significant disruption to the manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials could increase our costs and interrupt product supply, which can adversely impact our business.\n\nThe raw materials and other supplies, including agricultural commodities, fuel and packaging materials, such as  recycled  PET,  transportation,  labor  and  other  supply  chain  inputs  that  we  use  for  the  manufacturing, production  and  distribution  of  our  products  are  subject  to  price  volatility  and  fluctuations  in  availability caused by many factors, including changes in supply and demand, supplier capacity constraints, inflation, weather  conditions  (including  potential  effects  of  climate  change),  fire,  natural  disasters,  disease  or  pests (including the impact of greening disease on the citrus industry), agricultural uncertainty, health epidemics or pandemics  or  other  contagious  outbreaks  (including  COVID-19),  labor  shortages  (including  the  lack  of availability of truck drivers or as a result of COVID-19), strikes or work stoppages, governmental incentives and controls (including import/export restrictions, such as new or increased tariffs, sanctions, quotas or trade barriers), port  congestions  or  delays,  transport  capacity  constraints,  cybersecurity  incidents  or  other disruptions,  loss  or  impairment  of  key  manufacturing  sites,  political  uncertainties,  acts  of  terrorism, governmental instability or currency exchange rates. Many of our raw materials and supplies are purchased in the open market and the prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation. We experienced higher than anticipated  commodity,  packaging  and  transportation  costs  during  2021,  which  may  continue. When  input prices increase unexpectedly or significantly, we may",

How does the dual role of PepsiCo as both a peer benchmark and a direct competitor create distinct strategic implications for Colgate-Palmolive's investor communications versus Coca-Cola's market expansion strategies, based on the specific contexts in which each company references PepsiCo?",
      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive uses PepsiCo as part of a peer company index to benchmark its stock performance, which informs investor perceptions of its relative value within the consumer staples sector. This peer comparison implies PepsiCo serves as a standard for evaluating Colgate's financial and operational success. In contrast, Coca-Cola explicitly identifies PepsiCo as a 'primary competitor' specifically in international alcohol beverage markets, indicating direct market-level competition where both companies are actively pursuing growth. The strategic implication for Colgate is maintaining investor confidence through favorable comparisons with industry leaders like PepsiCo, while for Coca-Cola, it involves tactical market positioning to counter PepsiCo's competitive presence in new product categories. The dual role of PepsiCo highlights how one company leverages it for investor benchmarking while the other navigates direct market competition.",

          "chunk_text": "## Promotional and Marketing Programs\n\nIn addition to conducting our own independent advertising and marketing activities, we may provide promotional and marketing support and/or funds to our bottlers. In most cases, we do this on a discretionary basis under the terms of commitment letters or agreements, even though we are not obligated to do so under the terms of the bottler's agreements between our Company and the bottlers. Also, on a discretionary basis in most cases, our Company may develop and introduce new products, packages and equipment to assist the bottlers. Likewise, in many instances, we provide promotional and marketing support and/or funds and/or dispensing equipment and repair services to fountain and bottle/can retailers, typically pursuant to marketing agreements.\n\n## Investments in Bottling Operations\n\nMost of our branded beverage products are prepared, packaged, distributed and sold by independent bottling partners. However, from time to time we acquire or take control of a bottling operation, often in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance. Owning a bottling operation enables us to compensate for limited local resources; help focus the bottler's sales and marketing programs; assist in the development of the bottler's business and information systems; and establish an appropriate capital structure for the bottler. In line with our long-term bottling strategy, we may periodically consider options for divesting or reducing our ownership interest in a consolidated bottling operation, typically by selling all or a portion of our interest in the bottling operation to an independent bottler to improve Coca-Cola system efficiency. When we sell a consolidated bottling operation to an independent bottling partner in which we have an equity method investment, our Company continues to participate in the bottler's results of operations through our share of the equity method investee's earnings or losses.\n\nIn addition, from time to time we make equity investments representing noncontrolling interests in certain bottling operations with the intention of maximizing the strength and efficiency of the Coca-Cola system's production, marketing, sales and distribution capabilities around the world by providing expertise and resources to strengthen those businesses. These investments are intended to result in increases in unit case volume, net operating revenues and profits at the bottler level, which in turn generate increased sales for our Company's concentrate operations. When our equity investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee bottler's operating and financial policies, we account for the investment under the equity method.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nSales of our ready-to-drink beverages are somewhat seasonal, with the second and third calendar quarters historically accounting for the highest sales volumes. The volume of sales in the beverage business may be affected by weather conditions.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe commercial beverage industry is highly competitive and consists of numerous companies, ranging from small or emerging to very large and well established. These include companies that, like our Company, compete globally in multiple geographic areas, as well as businesses that are primarily regional or local in operation. Competitive products include numerous nonalcoholic sparkling soft drinks; water products, including flavored and enhanced waters; juices, juice drinks and nectars; dilutables (including syrups and powders); coffees; teas; energy drinks; sports drinks; milk and other dairy-based drinks; plant-based beverages; functional beverages, including vitamin-based products and relaxation beverages; and various other nonalcoholic beverages. These competitive products are sold to consumers in both ready-to-drink and non-ready-to-drink form. The Company has directly entered the alcohol beverage category in numerous markets outside the United States. In the United States, the Company has established a wholly owned, indirect, firewalled subsidiary, which uses third-party manufacturers and distributors to produce and sell alcohol products in certain regions of the United States and also authorizes alcohol-licensed third parties to use certain of our trademarks and related intellectual property on alcohol beverages that contain Company beverage bases. Competitive products include all alcohol ready-to-drink beverages containing various alcohol bases. In many of the countries in which we do business, PepsiCo, Inc. is a primary competitor. Other significant competitors include, but are not limited to, Nestl\u00e9 S.A., Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., Danone S.A., Suntory Beverage &amp; Food Limited, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Kirin Holdings, Heineken N.V., Diageo plc and Red Bull GmbH. We also compete against numerous regional and local companies and, increasingly, against smaller companies that are developing microbrands and selling them directly to consumers through e-commerce retailers and other e-commerce platforms. In addition, in some markets, we compete against retailers that have developed their own store or private-label beverage brands.\n\nCompetitive factors impacting our business include, but are not limited to, pricing, advertising, sales promotion programs,     in-store displays and point-of-sale marketing, digital marketing, product and ingredient innovation, availability, increased efficiency in production techniques, the introduction of new packaging as well as new vending and dispensing equipment, contracting with marketing assets (theaters, sports arenas, universities, etc.), and brand and trademark development and protection.",

Advertising costs are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses and are expensed as incurred. Certain consumer and trade promotional programs, such as consumer coupons, are recorded as a reduction of sales.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.\n\n## Inventories\n\nThe cost of approximately 75% of inventories is determined using the FIFO method, which is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of the remaining inventories, in the U.S. and Mexico, is determined using the LIFO method, which is stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventories in excess of one year of forecasted sales are classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as noncurrent 'Other assets.'\n\n## Property, Plant and E quipment\n\nLand, buildings and machinery and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided, primarily using the straight-line method, over the estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment and up to 40 years for buildings. Depreciation attributable to manufacturing operations is included in Cost of sales. The remaining component of depreciation is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## Goodwill and Other Intangibles\n\nGoodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets, such as the Company's global brands, are subject to impairment tests at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. In assessing impairment, the Company performs either a quantitative or a qualitative analysis.\n\nDetermining the fair value of the Company's reporting units for goodwill and the fair value of its intangible assets requires significant estimates and judgments by management. When a quantitative analysis is performed, the Company generally uses the income approach, which requires several estimates, including future cash flows consistent with management's strategic plans, sales growth rates and the selection of royalty rates and discount rates. The Company generally engages a third-party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired in business combinations.\n\nAs a result of a reporting structure realignment, the Company reallocated the goodwill of a certain reporting unit from the Europe segment to the North America segment. Before and after the reporting structure realignment, the Company completed an assessment indicating no goodwill impairment was required. Refer to Note 13, Segment Information for additional information.\n\nOther intangible assets with finite lives, such as local brands and trademarks, customer relationships and non-compete agreements, are amortized over their estimated useful lives, generally ranging from 5 to 40 years. Amortization expense related to intangible assets is included in Other (income) expense, net, which is included in Operating profit.",

When such events or changes in circumstances are present and a recoverability test is performed, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the ex pected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment charge. The impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of property, plant and equipment, including appraisals and discounted cash flow models. These appraisals and models include assumptions we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use.\n\n## Goodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets\n\nWe classify intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill. We determine the useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets after considering the specific facts and circumstances related to each intangible asset. Factors we consider when determining useful lives include the contractual term of any agreement related to the asset, the historical performance of the asset, the Company's long-term strategy for using the asset, any laws or other local regulations which could impact the useful life of the asset, and other economic factors, including competition and specific market conditions. Intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized, primarily on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, which is less than 20 years.\n\nWhen events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable, management performs a recoverability test of the carrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting profit and cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment charge. The impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of these assets, including discounted cash flow models, which include assumptions we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use.\n\nWe test intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, including trademarks, franchise rights and goodwill, for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. Our Company performs these annual impairment tests as of the first day of our third fiscal quarter. We perform impairment tests using various valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flow models and a market approach, to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset or the reporting unit, as applicable. We believe our assumptions are consistent with those a market participant would use. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount ex ceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, rather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing described above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any further assessment.\n\nWe perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is generally one level below our operating segments. Our operating segments are primarily based on geographic responsibility, which is consistent with the way management runs our business. Our geographic operating segments are generally subdivided into smaller geographic regions. These geographic regions are our reporting units. Our Global Ventures operating segment includes the results of our Costa Limited ('Costa'), innocent and do\u011fadan businesses, as well as fees earned pursuant to distribution coordination agreements",

Certain consumer and trade promotional programs, such as consumer coupons, are recorded as a reduction of sales.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.\n\n## Inventories\n\nThe cost of approximately 75% of inventories is determined using the FIFO method, which is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of the remaining inventories, in the U.S. and Mexico, is determined using the LIFO method, which is stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventories in excess of one year of forecasted sales are classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as noncurrent 'Other assets.'\n\n## Property, Plant and E quipment\n\nLand, buildings and machinery and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided, primarily using the straight-line method, over the estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment and up to 40 years for buildings. Depreciation attributable to manufacturing operations is included in Cost of sales. The remaining component of depreciation is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## Goodwill and Other Intangibles\n\nGoodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets, such as the Company's global brands, are subject to impairment tests at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. In assessing impairment, the Company performs either a quantitative or a qualitative analysis.\n\nDetermining the fair value of the Company's reporting units for goodwill and the fair value of its intangible assets requires significant estimates and judgments by management. When a quantitative analysis is performed, the Company generally uses the income approach, which requires several estimates, including future cash flows consistent with management's strategic plans, sales growth rates and the selection of royalty rates and discount rates. The Company generally engages a third-party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired in business combinations.\n\nAs a result of a reporting structure realignment, the Company reallocated the goodwill of a certain reporting unit from the Europe segment to the North America segment. Before and after the reporting structure realignment, the Company completed an assessment indicating no goodwill impairment was required. Refer to Note 13, Segment Information for additional information.\n\nOther intangible assets with finite lives, such as local brands and trademarks, customer relationships and non-compete agreements, are amortized over their estimated useful lives, generally ranging from 5 to 40 years. Amortization expense related to intangible assets is included in Other (income) expense, net, which is included in Operating profit.",

          "chunk_text": "depends on a number of conditions, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. These factors are even more difficult to estimate when global financial markets are highly volatile. As these factors are often interdependent and may not change in isolation, we do not believe it is practicable or meaningful to present the impact of changing a single factor. If we had used other assumptions and estimates when impairment tests were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions in future periods, or if different conditions exist in future periods, impairment charges could result. The total future impairment charges we may be required to record could be material.\n\n## Equity Method Investments\n\nEquity method investments are reviewed for impairment whenever significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to our cost basis in the investment. The fair values of most of our Company's investments in publicly traded companies are readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded companies, management's assessment of fair value is based on various valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds, and appraisals, as appropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe a market participant would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or estimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the determination of fair value. In the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. If management determines the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management's assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is based on, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of impairment charges, if applicable.\n\n## Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\n\nImpairment tests for indefinite-lived intangible assets must be performed at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. Our Company performs the annual impairment tests as of the first day of our third fiscal quarter. We perform impairment tests using various valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flow models and a market approach, to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset or the reporting unit, as applicable. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the determination of fair value. When performing these impairment tests, we estimate the fair values of the assets using management's best assumptions, which we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use. The estimates and assumptions used in these tests are evaluated and updated as appropriate.\n\nFor indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount ex ceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, rather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing described above.\n\nWe perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is generally one level below our operating segments. Our operating segments are primarily based on geographic responsibility, which is consistent with the way management runs our business. Our geographic operating segments are generally subdivided into smaller geographic regions. These geographic regions are our reporting units. Our Global Ventures operating segment includes the results of our Costa, innocent and do\u011fadan businesses, as well as fees earned pursuant to distribution coordination agreements between the Company and Monster, each of which is its own reporting unit. The Bottling Investments operating segment includes all of our consolidated bottling operations, regardless of geographic location. Generally, each consolidated bottling operation within our Bottling Investments operating segment is its own reporting unit. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination.\n\nIn order to test for goodwill impairment, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. However, the impairment charge recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The assumptions used in our impairment testing models are consistent with those we believe a market participant would use. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill rather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing discussed above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any further assessment.",

          "chunk_text": "## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ('U.S. GAAP'), which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following:\n\n- Principles of Consolidation\n- Recoverability of Equity Method Investments and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\n- Pension Plan Valuations\n- Revenue Recognition\n- Income Taxes\n\nManagement has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Company's Board of Directors. While our estimates and assumptions are based on our knowledge of current events and on actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions. For a discussion of the Company's significant accounting policies, refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nOur Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest. Additionally, there are situations in which consolidation is required even though the usual condition of consolidation (i.e., ownership of a majority voting interest) does not apply. Generally, this occurs when an entity holds an interest in another business enterprise that was achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship between such entity's voting interests in, and its ex posure to the economic risks and potential rewards of, the other business enterprise. This disproportionate relationship results in what is known as a variable interest, and the entity in which another entity holds a variable interest is referred to as a 'V IE.' An enterprise must consolidate a VIE if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the V IE. The primary beneficiary has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the V IE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the V IE.\n\nOur Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling operations, for which we were not determined to be the primary beneficiary. Our variable interests in these VIEs primarily relate to equity investments, profit guarantees or subordinated financial support. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Although these financial arrangements resulted in our holding variable interests in these entities, they did not empower us to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance. Creditors of our VIEs do not have recourse against the general credit of the Company, regardless of whether the VIEs are accounted for as consolidated entities.\n\nWe use the equity method to account for investments in companies if our investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. Our consolidated net income includes our Company's proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies. Our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investee includes considering key factors, such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions, other commercial arrangements and material intercompany transactions.\n\nWe eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions, including the intercompany transactions with consolidated VIEs and the intercompany portion of transactions with equity method investees.\n\n## Recoverability of Equity Method Investments and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\n\nOur Company faces many uncertainties and risks related to various economic, political and regulatory environments in the countries and territories in which we operate, particularly in developing and emerging markets. Refer to the heading 'Our Business - Challenges and Risks' above and 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' in Part I of this report as well as the heading 'Operations Review' below for additional information related to our present business environment. As a result, management must make numerous assumptions, which involve a significant amount of judgment, when performing impairment tests of equity method investments and indefinitelived intangible assets in various regions around the world. The performance of impairment tests involves critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management judgment and include inherent uncertainties. Factors that management must estimate include, among others, the economic lives of the assets, sales volume, pricing, royalty rates, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, long-term growth rates, discount rates, marketing spending, foreign currency ex change rates, tax rates, capital spending and proceeds from the sale of assets.

These uncertainties stem from the need to estimate fair value using market data and assumptions that could change, affecting reported values. Meanwhile, Mondelez recorded $32 million in intangible asset impairment charges in 2021 for a biscuit brand in North America, with additional impairments in prior years. Mondelez also noted eight brands with only a 10% or less excess of fair value over book value, signaling potential future impairments under uncertain economic conditions. Therefore, while Colgate-Palmolive faces uncertainty in estimating values, Mondelez has already realized financial impacts through impairment charges, showing a more direct effect of these accounting uncertainties.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Colgate-Palmolive's equity method investments were $64 million as of December 31, 2021, and the company faces significant uncertainty in estimates related to asset impairments and fair value assessments.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Mondelez recorded $32 million in intangible asset impairment charges in 2021 and identified eight brands with minimal excess fair value over book value, indicating realized and potential financial impacts from accounting estimate uncertainties.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies face accounting estimate uncertainties related to asset valuations, but Colgate-Palmolive's exposure remains in the estimation phase, while Mondelez has already recognized impairments, demonstrating differing impacts of the same type of financial reporting risk."

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Colgate-Palmolive Company and its majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The Company's investments in consumer products companies with interests ranging between 20% and 50%, where the Company has significant influence over the investee, are accounted for using the equity method. Net income (loss) from such investments is recorded in Other (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, equity method investments included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $64 and $56, respectively. Unrelated third parties hold the remaining ownership interests in these investments. Investments with less than a 20% interest are recorded at cost and periodically adjusted based on observable price changes or quoted market prices in active markets, if applicable.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent gains and losses at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. As such, the most significant uncertainty in the Company's assumptions and estimates involved in preparing the financial statements includes pension and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reserves. Additionally, the Company uses available market information and other valuation methodologies in assessing the fair value of financial instruments and retirement plan assets. Judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value and, accordingly, changes in assumptions or the estimation methodologies may affect the fair value estimates. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company's revenue contracts represent a single performance obligation to sell its products to trade customers. Sales are recorded at the time control of the products is transferred to trade customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for the products. Control is the ability of trade customers to 'direct the use of' and 'obtain' the benefit from our products. In evaluating the timing of the transfer of control of products to trade customers, the Company considers several control indicators, including significant risks and rewards of products, the Company's right to payment and the legal title of the products. Based on the assessment of control indicators, sales are generally recognized when products are delivered to trade customers.\n\nNet sales reflect the transaction prices for contracts, which include units shipped at selling list prices reduced by variable consideration. Variable consideration includes expected sales returns and the cost of current and continuing promotional programs. Current promotional programs primarily include product listing allowances and co-operative advertising arrangements. Continuing promotional programs are predominantly consumer coupons and volume-based sales incentive arrangements. The cost of promotional programs is estimated using the expected value method considering all reasonably available information, including the Company's historical experience and its current expectations, and is reflected in the transaction price when sales are recorded. Adjustments to the cost of promotional programs in subsequent periods are generally not material, as the Company's promotional programs are typically of short duration, thereby reducing the uncertainty inherent in such estimates.\n\nSales returns are generally accepted at the Company's discretion and are not material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company's contracts with trade customers do not have significant financing components or non-cash consideration and the Company does not have unbilled revenue or significant amounts of prepayments from customers. The Company records Net sales excluding taxes collected on its sales to its trade customers. Shipping and handling activities are accounted for as contract fulfillment costs and classified as Selling, general and administrative expenses.",

The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements. We have discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our Audit Committee. The following is a review of our most significant assumptions and estimates.\n\n## Goodwill and Indefinite-Life Intangible Assets :\n\nWe test goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on July 1. We assess goodwill impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entity-specific, industry, market and general economic factors affecting our goodwill reporting units. We review our operating segment and reporting unit structure for goodwill testing annually or as significant changes in the organization occur. Annually, we may perform qualitative testing, or depending on factors such as prior-year test results, current year developments, current risk evaluations and other practical considerations, we may elect to do quantitative testing instead. In our quantitative testing, we compare a reporting unit's estimated fair value with its carrying value. We estimate a reporting unit's fair value using a discounted cash flow method which incorporates planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of residual value. This year, for our Europe and North America reporting units, we used a market-based, weighted-average cost of capital of 6.4% to discount the projected cash flows of those operations. For our Latin America and AMEA reporting units, we used a risk-rated discount rate of 9.4%. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and industry and economic conditions based on available information. Given the uncertainty of the global economic environment and the impact of COVID-19, those estimates could be significantly different than future performance. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's net assets exceeds its fair value, we would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's fair value.\n\nIn 2021, 2020 and 2019, there were no impairments of goodwill. In connection with our 2021 annual impairment testing, each of our reporting units had sufficient fair value in excess of carrying value. While all reporting units passed our annual impairment testing, if planned business performance expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then the estimated fair values of a reporting unit or reporting units might decline and lead to a goodwill impairment in the future.\n\nAnnually, we assess indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of these assets. If significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset, we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value with its carrying value. We determine estimated fair value using planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of royalty rates. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, the asset is impaired and its carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value.\n\nDuring 2021, we recorded $32 million of intangible asset impairment charges related to a biscuit brand in North America. The impairment charges were calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the intangible assets on a global basis and were recorded within asset impairment and exit costs. We use several accepted valuation methods, including relief of royalty, excess earnings and excess margin, that utilize estimates of future sales, earnings growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates in determining a brand's global fair value. We also identified eight brands with $1,146 million of aggregate book value as of December 31, 2021 that each had a fair value in excess of book value of 10% or less. We continue to monitor our brand performance, particularly in light of the significant uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related impacts to our business. If the brand earnings expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future. In 2020, we recorded $144 million of intangible asset impairment charges related to gum, chocolate, biscuits and candy brands, with $83 million in North America, $53 million in Europe, $5 million in AMEA and $3 million in Latin America. In 2019, we recorded $57 million of intangible asset impairment charges related to gum, chocolate, biscuits and candy brands, with $39 million in Europe, $15 million in AMEA and $3 million in Latin America.\n\nRefer to Note 6, Goodwill and Intangible Assets , for additional information.",

          "chunk_text": "As discussed above, we continue to closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our business. During 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw a significant increase in demand across many of our categories, such as liquid hand soap, dish liquid, bar soap and cleaners. While consumer demand for most of these categories declined year-over-year in 2021, most remained above historical levels. We believe that some of this increased consumption is sustainable due to consumer behavior changes related to COVID-19. We expect increased volatility across all of our categories, and it is therefore difficult to predict category growth rates in the near term. COVID-19 has also disrupted our retail customers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers and other third parties; their ability to address COVID-19 and maintain their operations at full capacity has impacted and may continue to impact sales of and consumer access to our products. While we have taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effects of COVID-19, we cannot estimate with certainty the full extent of COVID-19's impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition. For more information about factors that could impact our business, including due to COVID-19, see 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.\n\nIn summary, we believe that we are well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to our strong financial condition, broad based experience operating in challenging environments, resilient global supply chain and focused business strategy. Our strategy is based on driving organic sales growth and long-term profitable growth through innovation within our core businesses, leveraging faster growth in adjacent categories, expanding in high-growth channels and markets and delivering margin expansion through operating leverage and efficiency. We are also seeking to maximize the impact of our environmental, social and governance programs and leading in the development of human capital, including our sustainability and social impact and DE&amp;I strategies. Our commitment to these priorities, the strength of our brands, the breadth of our global footprint and a commitment to driving efficiency in cash generation should position us well to manage through the challenges presented by COVID-19 and increase shareholder value over time.",

Disruptions, higher operating costs or uncertainties like those noted above could result in delays or modifications to our plans and initiatives.\n\n## Our Liquidity\n\nWe believe the steps we have taken to enhance our capital structure and liquidity, prior to and during the pandemic, strengthened our ability to operate during the pandemic:\n\n- In 2021, we generated $4.1 billion of cash from operations, or approximately $3.2 billion after deducting capital expenditures. During 2020 and 2019, we also generated $4.0 billion of cash from operations, or $3.1 billion in 2020 and $3.0 billion in 2019 after deducting capital expenditures.\n- As of December 31, 2021, we had $3.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand. As further discussed below, in January 2022, we acquired Chipita S.A. to expand our snacks portfolio. We paid approximately \u20ac1.3 billion ($1.5 billion) in cash and we assumed and substantially paid down \u20ac0.4 billion ($0.4 billion) of Chipita's debt in January for a total purchase price of approximately \u20ac1.7 billion ($1.9 billion). Based on our current available cash and access to financing markets, we do not anticipate any issue funding our obligations, including funding our next long-term debt maturities of approximately $1.2 billion in July 2022 and $0.5 billion in September 2022.\n- During 2021, we generated cash of approximately $1.5 billion from the sale of KDP shares. During 2020, we also received cash of \u20ac350 million ($394 million) from our participation in the JDE Peet's public share offerings and approximately $2.1 billion from our participation in the KDP secondary offering and subsequent KDP share sales (see additional information below and in Note 7, Equity Method Investments ).\n- We also have access to short-term and long-term financing markets and actively utilized these markets in 2020 and 2021. We continue to utilize the commercial paper markets in the United States and Europe for flexible, low-cost, short-term financing. We have issued additional long-term debt several times since the beginning of 2020 due to favorable market conditions and opportunities to shift a portion of our funding mix from short-term debt to long-term debt at a low cost. We renewed one of our credit facilities in early 2021 and now have $7.0 billion of undrawn credit facilities as well as other forms of short-term and long-term financing options available. As of December 31, 2021, we were, and we expect to continue to be, in compliance with our debt covenants (refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section and Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements ).\n\n## Our Financial Position\n\n- We continue to evaluate the realizability of our assets and indicators of potential impairment. We reviewed our receivables, inventory, right-of-use lease assets, long-lived assets, equity method and other long-term investments, deferred tax assets, goodwill and intangible assets.\n- During the third quarter of 2021, we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets and noted no impairments. Over the course of the ongoing pandemic, we have identified declines in demand for certain of our brands, primarily in the gum category, that prompted additional evaluation of our indefinite-life intangible assets. During the second quarter of 2021, we concluded that one biscuit brand was impaired and we recorded a $32 million impairment charge. During 2020, we concluded that eight brands were impaired and we recorded $144 million of impairment charges. While we did not identify impairment triggers for other brands, there continues to be significant uncertainty due to the pandemic. If brand earnings expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future. Refer to Note 6, Goodwill and Intangible Assets , for additional details on our intangible asset impairment evaluation.\n- Restructuring and implementation activities were in line with our Simplify to Grow Program strategic objectives.\n- Our equity investments in JDE Peet's and KDP give us additional financial flexibility.\n- We continue to monitor the quality of our assets and our overall financial position.\n- We also continue to maintain oversight over our core process controls through our centralized shared service model, with key controls operating as designed.\n\nAt this point in the pandemic, while we have seen some improvements in business and economic conditions across many markets in which we do business, additional adverse impacts could arise such as those noted above and some that we cannot currently anticipate. Barring material business disruptions or other negative developments, we expect to meet the demand of consumers for our snacks, food and beverage products. Our overall outlook for future snacks revenue growth remains strong, but as the pandemic continues, we anticipate increased volatility in revenues until COVID-related risks and current international supply chain issues and labor and transportation constraints subside and snacks consumption stabilizes to a more normal growth level.

          "chunk_text": "## COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Dollars in Millions Except Share and Per Share Amounts)\n\n## 2.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Colgate-Palmolive Company and its majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The Company's investments in consumer products companies with interests ranging between 20% and 50%, where the Company has significant influence over the investee, are accounted for using the equity method. Net income (loss) from such investments is recorded in Other (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, equity method investments included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $64 and $56, respectively. Unrelated third parties hold the remaining ownership interests in these investments. Investments with less than a 20% interest are recorded at cost and periodically adjusted based on observable price changes or quoted market prices in active markets, if applicable.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent gains and losses at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. As such, the most significant uncertainty in the Company's assumptions and estimates involved in preparing the financial statements includes pension and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reserves. Additionally, the Company uses available market information and other valuation methodologies in assessing the fair value of financial instruments and retirement plan assets. Judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value and, accordingly, changes in assumptions or the estimation methodologies may affect the fair value estimates. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company's revenue contracts represent a single performance obligation to sell its products to trade customers. Sales are recorded at the time control of the products is transferred to trade customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for the products. Control is the ability of trade customers to 'direct the use of' and 'obtain' the benefit from our products. In evaluating the timing of the transfer of control of products to trade customers, the Company considers several control indicators, including significant risks and rewards of products, the Company's right to payment and the legal title of the products. Based on the assessment of control indicators, sales are generally recognized when products are delivered to trade customers.\n\nNet sales reflect the transaction prices for contracts, which include units shipped at selling list prices reduced by variable consideration. Variable consideration includes expected sales returns and the cost of current and continuing promotional programs. Current promotional programs primarily include product listing allowances and co-operative advertising arrangements. Continuing promotional programs are predominantly consumer coupons and volume-based sales incentive arrangements. The cost of promotional programs is estimated using the expected value method considering all reasonably available information, including the Company's historical experience and its current expectations, and is reflected in the transaction price when sales are recorded. Adjustments to the cost of promotional programs in subsequent periods are generally not material, as the Company's promotional programs are typically of short duration, thereby reducing the uncertainty inherent in such estimates.\n\nSales returns are generally accepted at the Company's discretion and are not material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company's contracts with trade customers do not have significant financing components or non-cash consideration and the Company does not have unbilled revenue or significant amounts of prepayments from customers. The Company records Net sales excluding taxes collected on its sales to its trade customers. Shipping and handling activities are accounted for as contract fulfillment costs and classified as Selling, general and administrative expenses.",

Physical risks include increasing frequency of extreme weather events and natural disasters and effects on water availability and quality. These impacts increase risks to the global food production and distribution system. Decreased agricultural productivity caused by climate change might limit the availability of the commodities we purchase and use. These include cocoa, which is a critical raw material for our chocolate and biscuit portfolios that is particularly sensitive to changes in climate, as well as other raw materials such as dairy, wheat, vegetable oils, sugar and nuts. Weather events such as floods, severe storms or water shortages that are partially caused or exacerbated by climate change might disrupt our business operations or those of our suppliers, their suppliers, our external manufacturing partners, distributors or other business partners.\n\nTransition risks include increased focus by federal, state and local regulatory and legislative bodies globally regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating greenhouse gas emissions, energy policies and sustainability, including single use plastics. New legal and regulatory requirements have increased and could continue to increase our operating costs for things like energy or packaging through taxes or regulations, including payments under extended producer responsibility policies, taxes on specific packaging material types and targets to increase the use of reuse/refill delivery models. Increasing regulation of carbon taxes could also substantially increase our product supply chain and distribution costs. Concern about climate change might cause consumer preferences to switch away from products or ingredients considered to have high climate change impact and towards products that are more sustainably grown and made, and we expect to incur additional costs as we evolve our portfolio and engage in due diligence, verification and reporting in connection with our ESG and sustainability initiatives. We might not effectively address increased attention from the media, shareholders, activists and other stakeholders on climate change and related environmental sustainability matters, including deforestation, land use, water use and packaging, including plastic. Those stakeholders might also have requests or proposals that are not aligned with the focus of our efforts on climate change and ESG matters. Climate change-related impacts could also reduce demand for our products. If costs for raw materials increase or availability decreases, we raise prices for our products and our competitors respond differently to those cost or availability pressures, demand for our products and our market share could suffer. We have also experienced decreased demand for chocolate during periods when temperatures are warmer.\n\nIn 2021, we announced our goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Achieving this goal will require significant transformation of our business, capital investment and the development of technology that might not currently exist. We might incur significant additional expense or be required to recognize impairment charges in connection with our efforts, and we might be unable to achieve our goal.\n\nAny or all of these risks could materially and adversely affect our ability to meet the needs of our customers, reputation, product sales, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\n\n## Our retail customers are consolidating, and we must leverage our value proposition in order to compete against retailer and other economy brands.\n\nRetail customers, such as supermarkets, discounters, digital commerce merchants, warehouse clubs and food distributors in the European Union, the United States and other major markets, continue to consolidate, form buying alliances or be acquired by new entrants in the food retail market, resulting in fewer, larger customers. Large retail customers and customer alliances can delist our products or reduce the shelf space allotted to our products and demand lower pricing, increased promotional programs or longer payment terms. Retail customers might also adopt these tactics in their dealings with us in response to the significant growth in online retailing for consumer products, which is outpacing the growth of traditional retail channels and has increased further in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The growth of alternative online retail channels, such as direct-to-consumer and electronic business-tobusiness, may adversely affect our relationships with our large retail and wholesale customers.",

If we are not successful in continuing to adapt or to effectively react to changes in consumer preferences, purchasing patterns and market dynamics and/or expanding sales through eCommerce retailers and other alternative retail channels, including the profitable expansion of our own DTC capabilities, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## The growth of our business depends on the successful identification, development and launch of innovative new products.\n\nOur growth depends on the continued success of existing products, the successful identification, development and launch of innovative new and differentiated products and the expansion into adjacent categories, channels of distribution or geographies. Our ability to launch new products, to sustain existing products and to expand into adjacent categories, channels of distribution or geographies is affected by whether we can successfully:\n\n- identify, develop and fund technological innovations;\n- obtain and maintain necessary intellectual property protection and avoid infringing intellectual property rights of others;\n- obtain approvals and registrations of regulated products, including from the FDA and other regulatory bodies in the U.S. and abroad; and\n- anticipate and quickly respond to the needs and preferences of consumers and customers.\n\nThe identification, development and introduction of innovative new products that drive incremental sales involves considerable costs and effort, and any new product may not generate sufficient customer and consumer interest and sales to become a profitable product or to cover the costs of its development and promotion. Our ability to achieve a successful launch of a new product could also be adversely affected by preemptive actions taken by competitors in response to the launch, such as increased promotional activities and advertising. In addition, new products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace.\n\nOur ability to quickly innovate to adapt and market our products and to adapt our packaging to meet evolving consumer preferences is an essential part of our business strategy. The failure to develop and launch successful new products or to adapt our packaging and supply chain to meet such preferences could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in us not being the first to market, which could compromise our competitive position and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nIf, in the course of identifying or developing new products, we are found to have infringed the trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent or other intellectual property rights of others, directly or indirectly, through the use of third-party ideas or technologies, such a finding could adversely affect our ability to develop innovative new products and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Even if we are not found to infringe a third party's intellectual property rights, claims of infringement could adversely affect us, including by increasing costs and by delaying the launch of new products.",

We expect the improvements and efficiencies we drive will fuel our growth and continue to expand profit dollars. At the same time, we are continuing our efforts to sustainably source key ingredients, reduce our end-to-end environmental impact and innovate our processes and packaging to reduce waste and promote recycling.\n\n- Build a winning growth culture. To support the acceleration of our growth, we are becoming more agile, digital and local-consumer focused. We are committed to investing in a diverse and talented workforce that helps our business move forward with greater speed and agility. We empower our local teams to innovate and deliver consumers' snacking needs while continuing to leverage our global scale to efficiently support our growth strategy. We have given our local teams more autonomy to drive commercial and innovation plans as they are closer to the needs and desires of consumers. We will continue to leverage the efficiency and scale of our regional operating units while empowering our local and commercial operations to respond faster to changing consumer preferences and capitalize on growth opportunities. Our digital transformation program will also help to enable consumer demand and sales opportunities. We believe our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion and operating and cultural shifts to continue building a winning growth culture will help drive profitable top-line growth.\n\nWe run our business with a long-term perspective, and we believe the successful delivery of our strategic plan will drive top- and bottom-line growth and enable us to create long-term value for our shareholders.\n\nIn addition, we also continue to focus significant efforts to drive progress against our core initiatives for more sustainable and mindful snacking. For the last several years, we have been following the principles of the Science Based Targets initiative ('SBTi') as we continued to measure our greenhouse gas footprint, worked to reduce our emissions and accelerated our existing sustainability initiatives to become a more sustainable snacking company. In November 2021, we set a goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions across our full value chain (including Scope 1 through 3 greenhouse gas emissions) by 2050. We have signed the SBTi's Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C , aligning our long-term emissions mitigation goals with the aim of limiting temperature rise in accordance with the Paris Agreement, the 2015 international treaty on climate change. We also joined the United Nations Race to Zero campaign to help build momentum toward a decarbonized economy. These goals are a strategic priority and help guide us as we continue our sustainability work to drive lasting progress at scale and create long-term value for the business and our stakeholders. We continue to report on our progress in our annual Snacking Made Right report, where we discuss our performance against our environmental, social and governance ('ESG') goals and initiatives. Please also see our Sustainability and Mindful Snacking section below.\n\nIn 2020 and 2021, while the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected economies, marketplaces, communities and businesses around the world, including ours, we prioritized our employees, customers and communities and largely continued to execute against our strategic priorities. In this way, we positioned ourselves to emerge stronger. Please refer to our COVID-19 discussion in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more information.\n\n## Global Operations\n\nWe sell our products in over 150 countries and have operations in approximately 80 countries, including 131 manufacturing and processing facilities across 45 countries. The portion of our net revenues generated outside the United States was 75.1% in 2021, 73.2% in 2020 and 74.4% in 2019. For more information on our U.S. and non-U.S. operations, refer to Note 18, Segment Reporting; on our manufacturing and other facilities, refer to Item 2, Properties ; and risks related to our operations outside the United States, see Item 1A, Risk Factors .\n\nWe also monitor our revenue growth across emerging markets and developed markets-\n\n- Our emerging markets include our Latin America region in its entirety; the Asia, Middle East and Africa ('AMEA') region, excluding Australia, New Zealand and Japan; and the following countries from the Europe region: Russia, Ukraine, T\u00fcrkiye, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, the Baltics and the East Adriatic countries.\n- Our developed markets include the entire North America region, the Europe region excluding the countries included in the emerging markets definition, and Australia, New Zealand and Japan from the AMEA region.",

They also highlight the importance of agility and local consumer insights in competing with new and existing rivals in the evolving retail landscape. Mondelez International has responded by becoming more agile, digital, and local-consumer focused, empowering local teams to drive innovation and commercial plans. They have also emphasized sustainability through their 'Snacking Made Right' initiative and committed to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, aligning with the Science Based Targets initiative.

          "chunk_text": "## Distribution; Raw Materials; Competition; Trademarks and Patents\n\nOur Oral, Personal and Home Care products are sold to a variety of traditional and eCommerce retailers, wholesalers and distributors worldwide. Pet Nutrition products are sold by authorized pet supply retailers, veterinarians and eCommerce retailers. Certain of our products are also sold direct-to-consumer. Our sales to Walmart, Inc. and its affiliates represent approximately 12% of our Net sales in 2021. No other customer represents more than 10% of our Net sales. We support our products with advertising, promotion and other marketing (with increasing emphasis on digital) to build awareness and trial of our products. Our products are marketed by a direct sales force at individual operating subsidiaries or business units and by distributors or brokers.\n\nThe majority of raw and packaging materials used in our products are purchased from other companies and is available from several sources. No single raw or packaging material represents, and no single supplier provides, a significant portion of our total material requirements. We do, however, purchase certain key raw and packaging materials from single-source suppliers or a limited number of suppliers. For certain materials, however, new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry, governmental and/or Colgate standards, which can require additional investment and take a significant period of time. Raw and packaging material commodities, such as essential oils, resins, tropical oils, pulp, tallow, corn, poultry and soybeans, are subject to market price variations. For further information regarding the impact of changes in commodity prices, see Item 1A, 'Risk Factors - Volatility in material and other costs could adversely impact our profitability' and Item 7, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.'\n\nOur products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased retail trade concentration, the rapid growth of eCommerce, the integration of traditional and digital operations at key retailers and the growing presence of largeformat retailers, discounters and eCommerce retailers. Products similar to those that we produce and sell are available from multinational and local competitors in the U.S. and overseas. Certain of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we do. In addition, the substantial growth in eCommerce has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models. In certain geographies, we also face strong local competitors, who may be more agile and have better local consumer insights than we do. Private label brands sold by retailers are also a source of competition for certain of our products.\n\nThe retail landscape in many of our markets continues to evolve as a result of the rapid growth of eCommerce retailers, changing consumer preferences (as consumers increasingly shop online and via mobile and social applications) and the increased presence of alternative retail channels, such as subscription services and direct-to-consumer businesses. These trends have accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced disruptions in certain channels, including travel retail. We also continue to see changes in the purchasing patterns of our consumers, including the nature and/or frequency of visits by consumers to retailers and dental, veterinary and skin health professionals as well as a shift, in many markets, to purchasing our products online. We face competition in several aspects of our business, including pricing, promotional activities, new product and brand introductions and expansion into new geographies and channels. Product quality, innovation, brand recognition, marketing capability and acceptance of new products and brands largely determine success in Colgate's operating segments.\n\nWe consider trademarks to be of material importance to our business. We follow a practice of seeking trademark protection in the U.S. and throughout the world where our products are sold. Principal global and regional trademarks include Colgate, Palmolive, elmex, hello, meridol, Sorriso, Tom's of Maine, EltaMD, Filorga, Irish Spring, Lady Speed Stick, PCA SKIN, Protex, Sanex, Softsoap, Speed Stick, Ajax, Axion, Fabuloso, Murphy, Soupline and Suavitel, as well as Hill's Science Diet and Hill's Prescription Diet. Our rights in these trademarks endure for as long as they are used and/or registered. Although we actively develop and maintain a portfolio of patents, no single patent is considered significant to the business as a whole.",

      "question": "How does the competitive pressure from Walmart (WMT) in the department stores sector influence Procter & Gamble's (PG) ability to maintain profit margins, given PG's reliance on department stores as a key sales channel and WMT's EDLP pricing strategy?",
      "answer": "Walmart's everyday low pricing (EDLP) strategy puts downward pressure on product pricing across its supply chain, including branded manufacturers like Procter & Gamble. Since PG relies on department stores (including Walmart) as a key sales channel, WMT's pricing power and scale could limit PG's ability to pass on increased input costs (like commodities and raw materials) to retailers and consumers. This dynamic challenges PG's ability to maintain profit margins unless offset by cost-saving initiatives or increased sales volume.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - PG depends on department stores as a key sales channel for its products.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Walmart employs an EDLP pricing strategy, pricing items at consistently low prices without frequent promotions.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Since Walmart is a major customer for PG and uses EDLP, it limits PG's pricing flexibility, which could compress PG's profit margins unless mitigated through internal cost controls."

      "question": "How might Walmart's EDLP strategy create margin pressure for Procter & Gamble given P&G's reliance on department store channels for product distribution?",
      "answer": "Walmart's explicit focus on Every Day Low Prices (EDLP) as a core competitive strategy directly pressures suppliers like Procter & Gamble to maintain cost efficiency while preserving profitability. P&G acknowledges that continued concentration among retail customers, including department stores, could create significant cost and margin pressure on their business. If Walmart leverages its market position to demand lower wholesale prices to support its EDLP model, P&G would face challenges in maintaining its gross profit margins on sales through these channels. This dynamic forces P&G to either absorb the cost pressures, reducing their margins, or pass along cost savings through pricing actions while maintaining margins - a balance that becomes increasingly difficult as Walmart intensifies its EDLP approach.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from PG evidence - P&G explicitly states that 'continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure' and that 'our business performance could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer on trade terms and principles.'",
        "Step 2: Extract from WMT evidence - Walmart explicitly states that 'price leadership is a critical part of our business model' and that they are 'progressing our markets towards an EDLP approach.'",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The EDLP strategy at Walmart creates downward pressure on retail prices, which would flow back to suppliers like P&G through demands for lower wholesale prices. Since P&G relies on department stores (including Walmart) as a key distribution channel, they face margin pressure when balancing cost management with maintaining mutually acceptable trade terms with Walmart."

      "answer": "Walmart's 176 distribution facilities across 7 countries focus on efficiently moving goods to its international retail locations, relying on both centralized distribution and direct supplier shipments. This reflects a retail-centric logistics model optimized for high-volume store replenishment. In contrast, P&G's on-the-ground operations in about 70 countries support its direct sales to retailers and consumers across multiple channels including mass merchandisers, grocery stores, and e-commerce platforms. P&G's broader geographic footprint reflects its need to maintain close market presence for brand management and supply chain execution across diverse consumer goods categories.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - P&G operates in about 70 countries with on-the-ground operations, selling through multiple channels including mass merchandisers, grocery stores, and e-commerce platforms.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Walmart International utilizes 176 distribution facilities across 7 countries, with most purchases passing through these facilities before reaching stores.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While both companies operate globally in the Consumer Staples sector, Walmart's logistics strategy centers on regional distribution hubs serving its retail locations, whereas P&G maintains a broader operational footprint to support direct sales to retailers and consumers across diverse channels."

      "question": "Given that both KO and MO emphasize cybersecurity training programs as part of their risk management strategies, how does MO's enforcement mechanism involving performance thresholds and potential termination contrast with KO's approach of annual training without specified accountability measures, and what might this imply about their respective risk mitigation effectiveness?",
      "answer": "MO enforces its cybersecurity training through performance thresholds in phishing awareness exercises, with potential termination as a consequence for underperformance. In contrast, KO provides annual cybersecurity training programs covering topics like phishing and password protection but does not specify any accountability measures or consequences for non-compliance. This difference implies that MO may have a more rigorous approach to ensuring employee adherence to cybersecurity practices, potentially leading to stronger risk mitigation outcomes compared to KO's less enforced training model.",

      "answer": "Coca-Cola extinguished \u20ac2,430 million of Euro notes prior to maturity in 2021, incurring a $559 million charge due to the early repayment, while Altria repaid \u20ac1.25 billion in Euro notes in full at maturity in 2023 without incurring early repayment penalties.

      "answer": "In 2023, KO recognized a net decrease of $28 million in its valuation allowances, primarily due to changes in deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances on a certain equity method investment. This indicates that KO adjusted its expectations regarding the realization of tax benefits from this investment, which could affect its future tax expense if further changes occur. In contrast, MO accounted for its former investment in JUUL using the fair value option, which allowed it to reflect JUUL's financial data in its own reporting with a one-quarter lag. This difference in accounting treatment\u2014KO using traditional equity method valuation allowances and MO electing fair value treatment\u2014demonstrates that MO opted for a more market-sensitive approach, while KO maintained a more conservative stance tied to expected future tax income. These approaches reflect differing strategies in managing and reporting the financial implications of similar investment structures under applicable accounting standards.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From KO's 2023 10-K, extract the $28 million net decrease in valuation allowances related to equity method investments and the explanation that this reflects changes in deferred tax assets and expectations of future taxable income.",

        "Step 4: Conclude that these differences in accounting treatment for equity method investments reveal strategic variations in how the companies manage tax planning and financial reporting for similar investment structures."

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive performs impairment tests on indefinite-life intangible assets, such as global brands, at least annually or when events indicate potential impairment, and these tests are part of the company's standard accounting policies. Coca-Cola, on the other hand, highlights that its impairment tests of indefinite-lived intangible assets involve critical accounting estimates and require significant management judgment due to uncertainties such as economic lives of the assets, sales volume, pricing, royalty rates, and foreign currency exchange rates. While both companies are subject to impairment testing, Coca-Cola explicitly acknowledges the higher level of judgment and uncertainty involved in its testing process compared to Colgate-Palmolive's more procedural description.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Colgate-Palmolive states that goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets are subject to impairment tests at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Coca-Cola emphasizes that impairment tests of indefinite-lived intangible assets involve critical accounting estimates requiring significant management judgment due to numerous uncertain factors like economic lives, sales volume, pricing, royalty rates, and foreign exchange rates.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies disclose impairment testing policies for indefinite-lived intangible assets, but Coca-Cola explicitly highlights the judgment and uncertainty involved, while Colgate-Palmolive presents a more procedural description of the testing frequency."

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive performs impairment tests on indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as global brands, at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment. The company may choose either a quantitative or qualitative analysis for these tests. In contrast, Coca-Cola emphasizes the use of impairment tests involving critical accounting estimates and highlights the complexity introduced by uncertainties in economic, political, and regulatory environments. Coca-Cola's impairment testing involves assumptions such as sales volume, pricing, royalty rates, and discount rates, which reflect a more detailed and forward-looking approach. This suggests that Coca-Cola's asset management strategy places a stronger emphasis on dynamic, market-sensitive evaluation, while Colgate-Palmolive's approach appears more standardized and event-triggered.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Colgate-Palmolive performs impairment tests on indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment, using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - The difference in the frequency and methodology of impairment tests indicates contrasting asset management strategies: Colgate-Palmolive's approach is more standardized and event-triggered, while Coca-Cola's is more dynamic and market-sensitive."

Walmart notes that negative publicity, including incidents involving vendors or third-party service providers, could result in consumer boycotts, impacting its market position and net sales. Both companies acknowledge that boycotts could reduce revenue and profitability, but Walmart's omni-channel strategy and diversified revenue streams may provide some insulation compared to Coca-Cola's reliance on consistent global beverage demand.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from KO's 10-K - Coca-Cola explicitly mentions that product boycotts from political activism have reduced demand for its beverages, directly impacting profitability.",
        "Step 2: Extract from WMT's 10-K - Walmart states that negative publicity involving its vendors or third-party service providers could lead to consumer boycotts, which would affect its market position and net sales.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies identify consumer boycotts as a financial risk, but the impact differs: Coca-Cola faces direct demand reduction for its branded products, while Walmart's broader retail model could experience shifts in consumer trust and purchasing across its diverse product offerings.",
        "Step 4: Compare - Walmart's omni-channel strategy and diversified product base may moderate the impact of boycotts compared to Coca-Cola's global brand exposure, which is more directly tied to consumer sentiment toward its core products."

We may use the 'Investors' page of our website as a means of disclosing material, non-public information and to comply with our disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. Therefore, we encourage investors to monitor the 'Investors' page of our website and review the information we post on that page.\n\nThe SEC maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at the following address: http://www.sec.gov.\n\n## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in future periods. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS\n\n## Unfavorable general economic and geopolitical conditions could negatively impact our financial results.\n\nOur business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions, including global inflationary pressures, prevailing interest rates, credit market conditions, increased unemployment, levels of consumer and business confidence, bank failures, commodity (including energy) prices and supply, a recession or economic slowdown, trade policies, foreign currency exchange rates, changing policy positions or priorities, governmental rules and approaches to taxation, levels of government spending and deficits, and actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt. Many of the jurisdictions in which our products are sold have experienced, and could continue to experience, unfavorable changes in economic conditions, which could negatively affect the affordability of, and consumer demand for, our beverages, and certain markets in which our products are sold experienced intensified inflation throughout 2024, which may continue in 2025. Under difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products or by shifting away from our beverages to lower-priced products offered by other companies, including private-label brands, which could reduce our profitability and negatively affect our overall financial performance. In addition, the occurrence of global or regional health events, and any related governmental, private sector and individual consumer responses, could contribute to a recession, depression or global economic downturn.\n\nOther financial uncertainties in our major markets and unstable geopolitical conditions or events in certain markets, including international conflicts, civil unrest, acts of war, terrorism, governmental changes, or changes in international relations, could undermine global consumer confidence and reduce consumers' purchasing power, thereby reducing demand for our products. Throughout 2024, the Company faced disruption to our operations due to international conflicts, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East. Geopolitical instability has in the past led, and may in the future lead, to logistical, transportation and supply chain disruptions; business disruptions (including labor shortages); increased risk of cybersecurity incidents or other disruptions to our information systems; reduced availability and increased costs of transportation, energy, packaging, raw materials and other input costs; and heightened security risk, impacting employee safety and/or damage to infrastructure or our assets. At times, we have faced product boycotts resulting from political activism, which have reduced demand for our products. Restrictions on our ability to transfer earnings or capital across borders; price controls; limitations on profits; the negotiation of new trade agreements; new, expanded or retaliatory tariffs; import authorization requirements; and other restrictions on business activities, which have been or may be imposed or expanded as a result of political and economic instability, deterioration of economic relations between countries or otherwise, could impact our profitability. In addition, U.S. trade sanctions against countries designated by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism and/or financial institutions accepting transactions for commerce within such countries could increase significantly, which could make it difficult, or even impossible, for us to continue to make sales to bottlers in such countries. The imposition of retaliatory sanctions against U.S. multinational corporations by countries that are or may become subject to U.S. trade sanctions, or the delisting of our branded products by retailers in various countries in reaction to U.S. trade sanctions or other governmental actions or policies, could also negatively affect our business.",

RISK FACTORS\n\nThe risks described below could, in ways we may or may not be able to accurately predict, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally. The following risk factors do not identify all risks that we may face.\n\n## Strategic Risks\n\n## Failure to successfully execute our omni-channel strategy and the cost of our investments in eCommerce and technology may materially adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance.\n\nThe retail business continues to rapidly evolve with consumers embracing the digital shopping experience and expecting a robust online marketplace of goods available for purchase and delivery. As a result, the portion of total consumer ex penditures with retailers and wholesale clubs occurring through digital platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase could continue to accelerate.\n\nOur strategy, which includes investments in eCommerce, technology, including the use of artificial intelligence (\"AI\") and generative AI technologies (which continues to grow and evolve within our Company), talent, supply chain automation and enhancements, advertising, acquisitions, joint ventures, store remodels and other customer initiatives may not adequately or effectively allow us to continue to grow our eCommerce business, increase comparable sales, maintain or grow our overall market position or otherwise offset the impact on the growth of our business of a moderated pace of new store and club openings and sustain the current pace of remodels. The success of this strategy will depend in large measure on our ability to continue building and delivering a seamless omni-channel shopping experience and interconnected ecosystem for our customers that deepens and maintains our relationships with our customers across our various businesses and partnerships and reinforces our overall enterprise strategy.\n\nThe success of this strategy is further subject to the related risks discussed in this Item 1A. With the interconnected components of this enterprise strategy and an increasing allocation of capital ex penditures focused on these initiatives, changes in customer or member perceptions about our reputation in general, or our failure to successfully execute on individual components of this strategy may adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance, which could also result in impairment charges to intangible assets or other long-lived assets. In addition, a greater concentration of eCommerce sales, including increasing online grocery sales, could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-store or cross-club sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nFurthermore, the cost of certain investments in eCommerce, technology, talent and automation, including any operating losses incurred for those initiatives, will adversely impact our financial performance in the short-term and failure to realize the benefits of these investments may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term.\n\n## If we do not timely identify or effectiv ely respond to consumer trends or preferences, it could negativ ely affect our reputation, relationship w ith our customers, demand for the products and services we sell, our market share and the growth of our business.\n\nIt is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their shopping patterns, tastes and preferences. The success of our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products and services and the competitive environment. Our business is dependent on our ability to make critical decisions and predictions with respect to merchandise categories that quickly respond to changing consumer spending patterns, tastes and preferences, and any incorrect calculations by us may result in lower sales, spoilage and inventory markdowns, which could adversely impact our results of operations. Our ability to predict and adapt to changing tastes and preferences depends on many factors, including obtaining accurate and relevant data on customer preferences, emphasizing relevant merchandise categories, effectively managing our inventory levels, and implementing competitive and effective pricing and promotion strategies. Price transparency, assortment of products, customer experience, convenience, ease and the speed and cost of shipping are of primary importance to customers and continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products. We must continue to preserve our reputation, which is impacted by public perceptions and customer experiences. It may be difficult to address negative publicity across media channels, regardless of whether it is accurate. Negative incidents, including the loss of merchandise as a result of shrink or theft, misuse of AI technologies or a data breach as a result of a cyberattack could quickly erode trust and confidence in our business and could result in consumer boycotts, workforce unrest and government investigations. These incidents may involve us, our vendors that handle our data or personal information, our workforce or others with whom we do business, including third-party service providers and independent contractors. Societal expectations, preferences, trends and political expression are ever-changing and we try to adapt, evolve and maintain a balance that meets the acceptance of our customers, members, associates, shareholders, suppliers and other stakeholders, but we may not always move as quickly or in the direction that various competing interests desire or demand, which could impact our reputation. For instance, strong opinions continue to be publicly expressed both for",

Negative reputational incidents or negative perceptions of us could adversely impact our business and results of operations, including through lower sales, the termination of business relationships and negative impacts to associate retention and recruiting efforts. Moreover, failure to adequately predict customer demand and consumer spending patterns or otherwise optimize and operate our distribution and fulfillment centers could result in excess or insufficient inventory, service interruptions and increased costs, any of which could significantly harm our business. As we continue to add new fulfillment centers, our fulfillment and technology networks become increasingly complex and operating them in a way that effectively meets consumer demands continues to be challenging. There can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively.\n\n## We face strong competition from other retailers, wholesale club operators, omni-channel retailers and other businesses which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nEach of our segments competes for customers, employees, digital prominence, products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional, national and global physical, eCommerce and omni-channel retailers, social commerce platforms, wholesale club operators and retail intermediaries, as well as companies that offer services in digital advertising, data analytics/insights, fulfillment and delivery services, health and wellness and financial services. The omni-channel retail landscape is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and the entry of new, well-funded competitors may increase competitive pressures. In addition, for eCommerce and other internet-based businesses, newer or smaller businesses may be better able to innovate and compete with us.\n\nWe compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms, quality and accessibility of data for customers, suppliers, and associates, and cost, speed of and options for accurate delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical and digital operations.\n\nA failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail and other markets in which we operate, omni-channel innovations and omnichannel ecosystems developed by our competitors or delays or failure in execution of our strategy could materially adversely affect our financial performance. See \"Item 1.

Such consolidation, or other business combinations or alliances, competitive omni-channel ecosystems or reductions in operations may result in competitors with improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration and other improvements in their competitive positions. Such business combinations or alliances could allow these companies to provide a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\n\n## General or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nGeneral economic conditions and other economic factors, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance. Higher interest rates, higher prices of petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline and diesel fuel, increased costs for electricity and other energy, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, increased costs of essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in GDP and consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes or other changes in tax laws, changes in healthcare laws, other regulatory changes, the imposition of export and import restrictions, tariffs, trade barriers or other measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, overall economic slowdown or recession and other economic factors in the U.S., or in any of the other markets in which we operate, could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell in the U.S. or such other markets, change the mix of products we sell to any one or more markets with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods, adversely affect our net sales, growth rates, operating income and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory, or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results and could result in impairment charges to intangible assets, goodwill or other long-lived assets.\n\nIn addition, the economic factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation, labor, insurance or healthcare costs or commodity prices, including energy prices, and other economic factors in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative ex penses and otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results.\n\nThe economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers, which can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, in certain suppliers not producing",

RISK FACTORS\n\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in future periods. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS\n\n## Unfavorable general economic and geopolitical conditions could negatively impact our financial results.\n\nOur business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions, including global inflationary pressures, prevailing interest rates, credit market conditions, increased unemployment, levels of consumer and business confidence, bank failures, commodity (including energy) prices and supply, a recession or economic slowdown, trade policies, foreign currency exchange rates, changing policy positions or priorities, governmental rules and approaches to taxation, levels of government spending and deficits, and actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt. Many of the jurisdictions in which our products are sold have experienced, and could continue to experience, unfavorable changes in economic conditions, which could negatively affect the affordability of, and consumer demand for, our beverages, and certain markets in which our products are sold experienced intensified inflation throughout 2024, which may continue in 2025. Under difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products or by shifting away from our beverages to lower-priced products offered by other companies, including private-label brands, which could reduce our profitability and negatively affect our overall financial performance. In addition, the occurrence of global or regional health events, and any related governmental, private sector and individual consumer responses, could contribute to a recession, depression or global economic downturn.\n\nOther financial uncertainties in our major markets and unstable geopolitical conditions or events in certain markets, including international conflicts, civil unrest, acts of war, terrorism, governmental changes, or changes in international relations, could undermine global consumer confidence and reduce consumers' purchasing power, thereby reducing demand for our products. Throughout 2024, the Company faced disruption to our operations due to international conflicts, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East. Geopolitical instability has in the past led, and may in the future lead, to logistical, transportation and supply chain disruptions; business disruptions (including labor shortages); increased risk of cybersecurity incidents or other disruptions to our information systems; reduced availability and increased costs of transportation, energy, packaging, raw materials and other input costs; and heightened security risk, impacting employee safety and/or damage to infrastructure or our assets. At times, we have faced product boycotts resulting from political activism, which have reduced demand for our products. Restrictions on our ability to transfer earnings or capital across borders; price controls; limitations on profits; the negotiation of new trade agreements; new, expanded or retaliatory tariffs; import authorization requirements; and other restrictions on business activities, which have been or may be imposed or expanded as a result of political and economic instability, deterioration of economic relations between countries or otherwise, could impact our profitability. In addition, U.S. trade sanctions against countries designated by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism and/or financial institutions accepting transactions for commerce within such countries could increase significantly, which could make it difficult, or even impossible, for us to continue to make sales to bottlers in such countries. The imposition of retaliatory sanctions against U.S. multinational corporations by countries that are or may become subject to U.S. trade sanctions, or the delisting of our branded products by retailers in various countries in reaction to U.S. trade sanctions or other governmental actions or policies, could also negatively affect our business.",

          "chunk_text": "As a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency ex change rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our Consolidated Financial Statements reflecting significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates. Such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations.\n\nWe may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores, clubs and eCommerce platforms around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold. When we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit. Consequently, unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our results of operations.\n\n## Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks\n\nOur international operations subject us to legislative, judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance.\n\nIn addition to our U.S. operations, we operate retail and eCommerce businesses in Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico.\n\nDuring fiscal 2025, our Walmart International operations generated approximately 18% of our consolidated net sales. Walmart International's operations in various countries also source goods and services from other countries. Our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions; legal and regulatory constraints, such as regulation of product and service offerings including regulatory restrictions (such as foreign ownership restrictions) on eCommerce and retail operations in international markets, such as in India; restrictive governmental actions, such as trade protection measures or nationalization; antitrust and competition law regulatory matters, such as those underway in Canada, Mexico and India (relating to our Flipkart subsidiary); local product safety and environmental laws; tax regulations; local labor laws; anti-money laundering laws and regulations; trade policies; foreign ex change or currency regulations; laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection; and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future.\n\nChanging our operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade or newly imposed sanctions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to our operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and we may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. In addition, tensions between nation-state governments and conflicts of laws may lead to challenges for our operations. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response, or consumer boycotts in certain regions, could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could also adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation. The economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they recur, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries that have historically been less stable than the U.S. Additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also ex ist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, geopolitical tensions or events, laws and regulations.\n\nIn foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or U.S. sanctions laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries. Our global policies designed to regulate such business practices and our global compliance programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations may not be adequate to prevent the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are appropriately regulated by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could subject us to fines and penalties and adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation.",

      "question": "How do the impacts of weather patterns on Coca-Cola's beverage industry and Walmart's retail operations create different strategic challenges, and what specific business priorities have each company emphasized to mitigate these challenges?",
      "answer": "Weather patterns affect both Coca-Cola and Walmart, but each company faces distinct strategic challenges and responses. Coca-Cola notes that weather patterns influence consumer demand for beverages, particularly in seasonal markets, and can disrupt supply chains, especially regarding water availability and quality. In response, Coca-Cola is investing in a broader beverage portfolio, including low- and no-calorie options, and enhancing sustainable packaging and supply chain resilience. Walmart, on the other hand, experiences seasonal fluctuations in sales due to weather patterns, with historically the highest sales volume in the fourth quarter. To mitigate this, Walmart emphasizes an everyday low price (EDLP) and everyday low cost (EDLC) strategy, omni-channel offerings like pickup and delivery, and expanding its ecosystem into digital advertising and health and wellness services to maintain customer engagement year-round.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Coca-Cola identifies weather patterns as a factor affecting beverage demand and supply chain operations, and the company is investing in brand portfolio diversification and sustainable packaging.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Walmart notes that weather patterns contribute to seasonal sales variation, with the highest sales in the fourth quarter, and the company is responding with EDLP/EDLC, omni-channel services, and ecosystem expansion.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are impacted by weather patterns but experience different effects (supply chain and consumer preferences vs. seasonal sales fluctuations), leading to distinct strategic responses."

          "chunk_text": "\nWe operate in the highly competitive commercial beverage industry. We face strong competition from numerous other general and specialty beverage companies. We, along with other beverage companies, are affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the cost to manufacture and distribute products, consumer spending, economic conditions, availability and quality of water, consumer preferences, inflation, geopolitical conditions (including international conflicts), local and national laws and regulations, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, fuel prices, weather patterns and health crises.\n\nDespite the dynamic world in which we are currently operating, we believe we are well positioned to create value for our Company and our stakeholders. In an effort to support our future growth, we are continuing to invest in our portfolio of brands, our strategic capabilities and our people. We are focused on the following strategic priorities: shaping a portfolio of loved brands; transforming our marketing and innovation agenda; optimizing the Coca-Cola ecosystem; building talent and capabilities; and enhancing our license to operate.\n\n## Challenges and Risks\n\nBeing a global enterprise provides unique opportunities for our Company. Challenges and risks accompany those opportunities. Our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of our Company and the commercial beverage industry. Of these, six key strategic business challenges and risks are discussed below.\n\n## Obesity\n\nObesity continues to impact individuals, communities and countries worldwide. There is concern among consumers, public health professionals and governments about the health problems associated with obesity, which may present a challenge to our industry. We understand that obesity is a complex public health challenge, and we are committed to being a part of the solution.\n\nWe recognize the uniqueness of consumers' lifestyles and dietary choices. Therefore, we continue to do the following:\n\n- offer an ex panded portfolio of beverage choices, including reduced-, low- and no-calorie beverage options;\n- provide transparent nutrition information, featuring calories on the front of most of our packages;\n- provide our beverages in a range of packaging sizes, including small sizes to enable portion control; and\n- market responsibly, including no advertising targeted to children under 13.\n\nThe heritage of our Company is to lead, and innovation is critical for leadership. As such, we are resolute in continuing to innovate and are committed to partnering with suppliers to invest in research and development of new noncaloric sweeteners and flavors that help us create the best tasting beverages, including options with low or no calories. We want to be a helpful and credible partner in the fight against obesity.\n\n## Evolving Consumer Product Preferences\n\nWe are impacted by shifting consumer demographics and needs, on-the-go lifestyles and consumers who are empowered with more information than ever. As a consequence of these changes, many consumers want more beverage choices, personalization, a focus on sustainability, and transparency related to our products and packaging. We are committed to meeting changing consumer needs and to generating growth through our evolving portfolio of beverage brands and products (including numerous low- and no-calorie products); selectively expanding into other profitable categories of the commercial beverage industry; investing in innovative and sustainable packaging; and including easy-to-access information about our beverages on our website.",

          "chunk_text": "## Other Information\n\nCompetition. We compete with brick and mortar, eCommerce and omni-channel retailers operating discount, department, retail and wholesale grocery, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, and supercenter-type stores, membership-only warehouse clubs, gasoline stations, social commerce platforms, as well as companies that offer services in digital advertising, fulfillment and delivery services, health and wellness and financial services. Our ability to develop and effectively operate different formats at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determines our competitive position in the retail industry within the markets where we operate. Each of these landscapes is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and new business models and the entry of new, well-funded competitors continue to intensify this competition. Some of our competitors have longer histories in these lines of business, more customers and greater brand recognition. They may be able to obtain more favorable terms from suppliers and business partners and to devote greater resources to the development of these businesses. In addition, for eCommerce and other internet-based businesses, newer or smaller businesses may be better able to innovate and compete with us.\n\nWe compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise and selection availability, services offered to customers, the quality of the products and services we offer, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical and digital operations. We employ many strategies and programs designed to meet competitive pressures within our industry. These strategies include the following:\n\n- EDLP: our pricing philosophy under which we price items at everyday low prices so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity;\n- EDLC: everyday low cost is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers;\n- Omni-channel offerings such as pickup and delivery, all of which enhance convenience and seek to serve customers in the ways they want to be served; and\n- Expanding our ecosystem and the products and services we offer in areas such as digital advertising, marketplace and fulfillment services, health and wellness, and financial services to provide our customers a broader set of offerings to meet expanding needs.\n\nSeasonal Aspects of Operations. Our business is seasonal to a certain extent and varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, our highest sales volume for each segment has occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year.\n\nSuppliers and Supply Chain. As a retailer and warehouse club operator, we utilize a global supply chain that includes both U.S. and international suppliers from whom we purchase the merchandise that we sell in our stores, clubs and online. In many instances, we purchase merchandise from producers located near the stores and clubs in which such merchandise will be sold, particularly products in the \"fresh\" category. Consistent with applicable laws, we offer our suppliers the opportunity to efficiently sell significant quantities of their products to us. These relationships enable us to obtain pricing that reflects the volume, certainty and cost-effectiveness these arrangements provide to such suppliers, which in turn enables us to provide low prices to our customers. Our suppliers are subject to standards of conduct, including requirements that they comply with local labor laws, local worker safety laws and other applicable laws. Our ability to acquire from our suppliers the assortment and volume of products we wish to offer to our customers, to receive those products within the required time through our supply chain and to distribute those products to our stores and clubs, determines, along with other supply chain logistics matters (such as containers or port access for example), in part, our in-stock levels in our stores and clubs and the attractiveness of our merchandise assortment we offer to our customers and members.\n\nIntellectual Property. We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as important to our success, and with respect to our associates, customers and others, we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent laws, tradesecret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties.\n\nGovernment Regulation. As a company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions. For additional information, see the risk factors herein in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" under the sub-caption \"Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks.\"",

Such judgments impact both the timing and amount of the reserves that are recognized, including judgments about re-measuring liabilities for positions taken in prior years' tax returns in light of new information.\n\nThe  following  are  the  primary  procedures  we  performed  to  address  this  critical  audit  matter.  We evaluated  the  design  and  tested  the  operating  effectiveness  of  certain  internal  controls  related  to  the unrecognized tax benefits process, including controls to (1) identify uncertain income tax positions, (2) evaluate  the  tax  law  and  tax  authority's  settlement  history  used  to  estimate  the  unrecognized  tax benefits, and (3) monitor for new information that may give rise to changes to the existing unrecognized tax  benefits,  such  as  progress  of  a  tax  examination,  new  tax  law  or  tax  authority  settlements.  We involved  tax  and  valuation  professionals  with  specialized  skills  and  knowledge,  who  assisted  in assessing the unrecognized tax benefits by (1) evaluating the Company's tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, and (2) assessing the Company's interpretation of existing tax law as well as new and amended tax laws, tax positions taken, associated external counsel opinions, information from tax examinations, relevant court rulings and tax authority settlements.\n\n## /s/ KPMG LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1990.\n\nNew York, New York February 9, 2022",

          "chunk_text": "governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment.\n\nA core operating principle is that our tax structure is based on our business operating model, such that profits are earned in line  with  the  business  substance and functions of the various legal  entities  in  the  jurisdictions  where  those  functions  are performed.  However,  because  of  the  complexity  of  transfer pricing concepts, we may have income tax uncertainty related to  the  determination  of  intercompany  transfer  prices  for  our various cross-border transactions.  We  have  obtained  and continue to prioritize  the  strategy  of  seeking  advance  rulings with tax authorities to reduce this uncertainty. We estimate that our current portfolio of advance rulings reduces this uncertainty  with  respect  to  over  70%  of  our  global  earnings. We  evaluate  our  tax  positions  and  establish  liabilities  in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties considering  changing  facts  and  circumstances,  such  as  the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have several audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based  on currently  available  information,  we  believe  that  the  ultimate outcomes  will  not  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n\nBecause there are several estimates and assumptions inherent in  calculating  the  various  components  of  our  tax  provision, certain future events such  as changes  in tax legislation, geographic  mix  of  earnings,  completion  of  tax  audits  or earnings  repatriation  plans  could  have  an  impact  on  those estimates  and  our  effective  tax rate.  See  Note  5  to  the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on the Company's income taxes.\n\n## Employee Benefits\n\nWe  sponsor  various  postretirement  benefits  throughout  the world. These include pension plans, both defined contribution plans  and  defined  benefit  plans,  and  other  postretirement benefit (OPRB) plans, consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees. For accounting purposes, the defined benefit pension and OPRB plans require assumptions to estimate the net projected and accumulated benefit obligations,  including  the  following  variables:  discount  rate; expected  salary  increases;  certain  employee-related  factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; expected return on  assets;  and  health  care  cost  trend  rates.  These  and  other assumptions  affect  the  annual  expense  and  net  obligations recognized  for  the  underlying  plans.  Our  assumptions  reflect our  historical  experiences  and  management's  best  judgment regarding future expectations. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions  is  deferred.  If  this  net  deferred  amount  exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year. The  cost  or  benefit  of  plan  changes,  such  as  increasing  or decreasing  benefits  for  prior  employee  service  (prior  service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits.\n\nThe  expected  return  on  plan  assets  assumption  impacts  our defined  benefit  expense  since  many  of  our  defined  benefit pension  plans  and  our  primary  OPRB  plan  are  partially funded. The process for setting the expected rates of return is described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For 2022, the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and OPRB assets was 5.5% and 8.4%, respectively. A  change  in  the  rate  of  return  of  100  basis  points  for  both pension  and  OPRB  assets  would  impact  annual  after-tax benefit/expense by approximately $125 million.\n\nSince pension and OPRB  liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate impacts our plan obligations  and  expenses.  Discount  rates  used  for  our  U.S. defined benefit pension and OPRB plans are based on a yield curve  constructed  from  a  portfolio  of  high  quality  bonds  for which  the  timing  and  amount  of  cash  outflows  approximate the estimated payouts of the plan. For our international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated  AA  or  better.  The  average discount  rate  on  the  defined  benefit  pension  plans  of  3.7% represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist. A 100 basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $135 million. The average discount rate on the OPRB plan of 5.0% reflects the higher interest rates generally applicable  in  the  U.S.,  which  is  where  most  of  the  plan participants receive benefits. A 100 basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax OPRB expense by approximately  $10  million.  See  Note  8  to  the  Consolidated Financial  Statements  for  additional  details  on  our  defined benefit pension and OPRB plans.\n\n## Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\nSignificant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our goodwill reporting units and intangible assets. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation  specialists  for  significant  goodwill  reporting  units and  intangible  assets.  The  fair  value  estimates  are  based  on available historical information and on future expectations. We typically  estimate  the  fair  value  of  these  assets  using  the income  method,  which  is  based  on  the  present  value  of estimated  future  cash  flows  attributable  to  the  respective assets.  The  valuations  used  to  establish  and  to  test  goodwill and  intangible  assets  for  impairment  are  dependent  on  a number  of  significant  estimates  and  assumptions,  including macroeconomic  conditions,  overall  category  growth  rates, competitive activities, cost containment and margin progression,  Company  business  plans  and  the  discount  rate applied to cash flows.\n\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized, but are tested at least annually for impairment. Our ongoing annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  occurs  during  the  3  months ended  December  31.

      "question": "How does the impairment assessment process for indefinite-lived intangible assets, as described by PepsiCo, relate to the critical audit matter identified in Procter & Gamble's evaluation of the Gillette brand, particularly in terms of the assumptions used and the potential financial impact?",
      "answer": "PepsiCo performs annual impairment assessments for indefinite-lived intangible assets using either a qualitative or quantitative approach, with the latter involving discounted cash flow models that rely on assumptions such as future sales growth, perpetuity growth rates, and weighted-average cost of capital (WACC). Similarly, Procter & Gamble evaluates the Gillette brand, an indefinite-lived intangible asset with a carrying value of $14.1 billion as of June 30, 2022, using the income method based on forecasts of future net sales, earnings, royalty rates, and discount rates. The critical audit matter in P&G\u2019s financial statements highlights that changes in these assumptions could significantly affect the fair value or impairment charge. Both companies rely heavily on forward-looking assumptions that require significant management judgment, and a deterioration in these assumptions could lead to impairment charges, directly impacting financial results. This shows a shared financial risk mechanism tied to the sensitivity of valuation models used in the impairment assessment process.",

We recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments when a loss is probable and estimable.\n\n## Research and Development\n\nWe engage in a variety of research and development activities and continue to invest to accelerate growth and to  drive  innovation  globally.  Consumer  research  is  excluded  from  research  and  development  costs  and included in other marketing costs. Research and development costs were $752 million, $719 million and $711 million  in  2021,  2020  and  2019,  respectively,  and  are  reported  within  selling,  general  and  administrative expenses.\n\n## Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at  least  annually,  using  either  a  qualitative  or  quantitative  approach.  We  perform  this  annual  assessment during  our  third  quarter,  or  more  frequently  if  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  value  may  not  be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include macroeconomic (including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic), industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical  financial  performance  and  significant  changes  in  the  brand  or  reporting  unit.  If  the  qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.\n\nIn the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, an assessment is performed to  determine  the  fair  value  of  the  indefinite-lived  intangible  asset  and  the  reporting  unit,  respectively. Estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management's strategic business plans, annual sales growth  rates,  perpetuity  growth  assumptions  and  the  selection  of  assumptions  underlying  a  discount  rate (weighted-average  cost  of  capital)  based  on  market  data  available  at  the  time.  Significant  management judgment  is  necessary  to  estimate  the  impact  of  competitive  operating,  macroeconomic  and  other  factors (including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic) to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash  flows. All  assumptions  used  in  our  impairment  evaluations  for  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  and goodwill, such as forecasted growth rates (including perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost  of  capital,  are  based  on  the  best  available  market  information  and  are  consistent  with  our  internal forecasts and operating plans. A deterioration in these assumptions could adversely impact our results.\n\nAmortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows.\n\nSee Note 4 for further information.\n\n## Other Significant Accounting Policies\n\nOur other significant accounting policies are disclosed as follows:\n\n- Basis of Presentation - Note 1 includes a description of our policies regarding use of estimates, basis of presentation and consolidation.\n- Income Taxes - Note 5.\n- Share-Based Compensation Note 6.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe  have  also  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated August 5, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or  fraud.  Our  audits  included  performing  procedures  to  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  financial  statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,  evidence  regarding  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements.  Our  audits  also  included  evaluating  the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated  or  required  to  be  communicated  to  the  audit  committee  and  that  (1)  relates  to  accounts  or  disclosures  that  are material  to  the  financial  statements  and  (2)  involved  our  especially  challenging,  subjective,  or  complex  judgments.  The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are  not,  by  communicating  the  critical  audit  matter  below,  providing  a  separate  opinion  on  the  critical  audit  matter  or  on  the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Intangible Assets - Gillette Indefinite Lived Intangible Asset - Refer to Notes 1 and 4 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company's evaluation of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each indefinite lived intangible asset to its carrying value. The Company estimates fair value using the income method, which is based on  the  present  value  of  estimated  future  cash  flows  attributable  to  the  respective  assets.  This  requires  management  to  make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future net sales and earnings, including growth rates beyond a 10-year time period, royalty rates, and discount rate. Changes in the assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any impairment charge, or both. The Company performed their annual impairment assessment of the Gillette brand indefinite  lived  intangible  asset  (the  'Gillette  brand')  as  of  December  31,  2021.  Because  the  estimated  fair  value  exceeds  the carrying value, no impairment was recorded. As of June 30, 2022, the carrying value of Gillette indefinite lived intangible asset was $14.1 billion.\n\nWe identified the Company's impairment evaluation of the Gillette indefinite lived intangible asset as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset. A high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort was required when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of  management's estimates and assumptions related to the forecasts of future net sales and earnings as well as the selection of royalty rates and discount rate, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to forecasts of future net sales and earnings and the selection of the royalty rates and discount rate for the Gillette indefinite lived intangible asset included the following, among others:",

In contrast, KO employs hedging activities that are designed to mitigate a portion of the unfavorable impact of exchange rate fluctuations on its net income, though KO does not disclose a specific notional amount. KO also notes that its reported percentages do not reflect the effects of hedging, implying that the financial impact of its hedging strategy is significant enough to alter the actual operating results.

These fluctuations compound with other macroeconomic pressures like inflation and fuel prices, increasing KO's financial risk exposure.

In an effort to support our future growth, we are continuing to invest in our portfolio of brands, our strategic capabilities and our people. We are focused on the following strategic priorities: shaping a portfolio of loved brands; transforming our marketing and innovation agenda; optimizing the Coca-Cola ecosystem; building talent and capabilities; and enhancing our license to operate.\n\n## Challenges and Risks\n\nBeing a global enterprise provides unique opportunities for our Company. Challenges and risks accompany those opportunities. Our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of our Company and the commercial beverage industry. Of these, six key strategic business challenges and risks are discussed below.\n\n## Obesity\n\nObesity continues to impact individuals, communities and countries worldwide. There is concern among consumers, public health professionals and governments about the health problems associated with obesity, which may present a challenge to our industry. We understand that obesity is a complex public health challenge, and we are committed to being a part of the solution.\n\nWe recognize the uniqueness of consumers' lifestyles and dietary choices. Therefore, we continue to do the following:\n\n- offer an ex panded portfolio of beverage choices, including reduced-, low- and no-calorie beverage options;\n- provide transparent nutrition information, featuring calories on the front of most of our packages;\n- provide our beverages in a range of packaging sizes, including small sizes to enable portion control; and\n- market responsibly, including no advertising targeted to children under 13.\n\nThe heritage of our Company is to lead, and innovation is critical for leadership. As such, we are resolute in continuing to innovate and are committed to partnering with suppliers to invest in research and development of new noncaloric sweeteners and flavors that help us create the best tasting beverages, including options with low or no calories. We want to be a helpful and credible partner in the fight against obesity.\n\n## Evolving Consumer Product Preferences\n\nWe are impacted by shifting consumer demographics and needs, on-the-go lifestyles and consumers who are empowered with more information than ever. As a consequence of these changes, many consumers want more beverage choices, personalization, a focus on sustainability, and transparency related to our products and packaging. We are committed to meeting changing consumer needs and to generating growth through our evolving portfolio of beverage brands and products (including numerous low- and no-calorie products); selectively expanding into other profitable categories of the commercial beverage industry; investing in innovative and sustainable packaging; and including easy-to-access information about our beverages on our website.",

      "question": "Given COST's competitive investments in warehouse club technology and PG's reliance on grocery stores for product distribution, how might COST's focus on improving member-facing technology impact PG's ability to maintain shelf space and trade terms in this channel, particularly as PG faces rising input costs that require pricing actions?",
      "answer": "COST's investments in member-facing technology, such as websites and mobile applications, are aimed at improving customer experience and competitiveness in the warehouse club segment. This could draw more foot traffic and purchasing volume away from traditional grocery stores, which are a key sales channel for PG. PG acknowledges that a significant reduction in shelf space or inventory levels by grocery store customers\u2014potentially due to increased competition from warehouse clubs\u2014could negatively impact its business. Additionally, PG is managing rising input costs (e.g., commodities like resins and pulp) and depends on maintaining trade terms that align with pricing and profitability targets. If grocery stores reduce PG\u2019s shelf space due to shifting consumer preferences or competitive pressures from COST, PG may face greater difficulty passing on cost increases to retailers, thereby compressing margins and affecting cash flows.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from COST_10k_2023.pdf - COST emphasizes investments in websites and mobile applications to remain competitive, noting that failure to improve member-facing technology could adversely affect their results.",
        "Step 2: Extract from PG_10k_2023.pdf - PG relies heavily on grocery stores for product distribution and acknowledges that reduced shelf space or inventory levels could significantly impact their business.",
        "Step 3: Extract from PG_10k_2023.pdf - PG is experiencing cost pressures from commodities and packaging materials and depends on pricing actions and trade terms to maintain profitability.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - If COST\u2019s technology investments attract more consumers to warehouse clubs, grocery stores may see reduced traffic and sales, leading them to prioritize more profitable or space-efficient brands over PG, which could limit PG\u2019s ability to pass on cost increases and maintain margins."

      "question": "How does the mention of 'private-label' products in MDLZ's 2023 risk factors relate to Costco's business model as described in its 2023 10-K, and what potential impact could this have on MDLZ's sales or pricing strategy?",
      "answer": "MDLZ's 2023 10-K highlights that increased prices for its products could lead consumers to switch to 'private-label' or lower-priced offerings, which directly relates to Costco's business model of offering private-label products alongside national brands. Costco's focus on private-label products, which are often more affordable, could attract consumers looking to cut costs amid inflationary pressures. This implies that if MDLZ raises prices to offset rising input costs, it risks losing customers to private-label alternatives like those offered by Costco, potentially reducing MDLZ's sales volume or forcing it to adjust its pricing strategy.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Costco's business model includes offering a limited selection of private-label products to drive high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - MDLZ notes that increased prices could lead consumers to switch to 'private-label' or lower-priced product offerings.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The presence of private-label products in Costco's model directly competes with branded products like those of MDLZ. If MDLZ raises prices due to rising input costs, consumers may shift to Costco's private-label alternatives, impacting MDLZ's sales and pricing decisions."

      "answer": "COST explicitly lists New Zealand as a distinct operational location in its geographic segment reporting, indicating it is significant enough to be separately disclosed as part of its reportable segments. In contrast, MDLZ includes New Zealand within its 'developed markets' category under the broader AMEA (Asia, Middle East, Africa) region, suggesting it is aggregated with other developed markets rather than reported separately. This difference reveals that COST takes a more granular approach to geographic segment disclosure, listing individual countries where it operates, while MDLZ adopts a more consolidated structure, grouping countries into broader regional categories for financial reporting purposes.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From COST's 10-K, we learn that it operates in New Zealand and reports it as a distinct geographic location within its segment reporting structure.",
        "Step 2: From MDLZ's 10-K, we learn that New Zealand is included in the 'developed markets' classification within the AMEA region, not as a standalone geographic segment.",
        "Step 3: Comparing these two approaches reveals differing philosophies in geographic reporting: COST provides more detailed country-level transparency, while MDLZ consolidates markets for segment reporting."

For our Company, the only assets and liabilities that are adjusted to fair value on a recurring basis are investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values, debt securities classified as trading or available-for-sale, derivative financial instruments and our contingent consideration liability. Additionally, the Company adjusts the carrying value of certain long-term debt as a result of the Company's fair value hedging strategy.\n\n## Investments in Debt and Equity Securities\n\nThe fair values of our investments in debt and equity securities using quoted market prices from daily exchange traded markets are based on the closing price as of the balance sheet date and are classified as Level 1. The fair values of our investments in debt and equity securities classified as Level 2 are priced using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. Inputs into these valuation techniques include actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes and other similar data. These inputs are obtained from quoted market prices, independent pricing vendors or other sources.\n\n## Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nThe fair values of our futures contracts are primarily determined using quoted contract prices on futures exchange markets. The fair values of these instruments are based on the closing contract prices as of the balance sheet date and are classified as Level 1.\n\nThe fair values of our derivative instruments other than futures are determined using standard valuation models. The significant inputs used in these models are readily available in public markets, or can be derived from observable market transactions, and therefore have been classified as Level 2. Inputs used in these standard valuation models for derivative instruments other than futures include the applicable exchange rates, forward rates, interest rates, discount rates and commodity prices. The standard valuation model for options also uses implied volatility as an additional input. The discount rates are based on the historical U.S. Deposit or U.S. Treasury rates, and the implied volatility specific to options is based on quoted rates from financial institutions.\n\nIncluded in the fair values of derivative instruments is an adjustment for nonperformance risk. The adjustment is based on current credit default swap ('CDS') rates applied to each contract, by counterparty. We use our counterparty's CDS rate when we are in an asset position and our own CDS rate when we are in a liability position. The adjustment for nonperformance risk did not have a significant impact on the estimated fair values of our derivative instruments.\n\nThe following tables summarize those assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in millions):\n\n",

      "question": "How does Coca-Cola's competitive approach differ between its nonalcoholic beverage segment (where it directly competes with Heineken N.V.) and its alcoholic beverage segment, and how does Philip Morris International's peer group classification help contextualize this competitive positioning?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola directly competes with Heineken N.V. in the nonalcoholic beverage segment, as stated in KO's 10-K, which lists Heineken N.V. among its key competitors in the global beverage industry. In contrast, in the alcoholic beverage segment within the U.S., Coca-Cola does not directly compete but instead authorizes third parties with alcohol licenses to use its brands on alcoholic beverages. This reflects a strategic difference: active direct competition in nonalcoholic beverages versus a brand-licensing approach in alcoholic beverages. Philip Morris International's 2022 10-K includes both Coca-Cola and Heineken N.V. in its peer group of global consumer product companies, indicating that both are viewed as industry peers in terms of scale and market presence. This peer group context reinforces that Coca-Cola and Heineken N.V. operate at a similar level of global influence, yet Coca-Cola chooses different go-to-market strategies depending on the beverage category\u2014direct competition in nonalcoholic drinks and indirect brand licensing in alcoholic drinks.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From KO's 10-K, we learn that Coca-Cola directly competes with Heineken N.V. in the nonalcoholic beverage market, highlighting Heineken as a significant global competitor.",
        "Step 2: Also from KO's 10-K, Coca-Cola's approach to the alcoholic beverage segment in the U.S. is indirect\u2014authorizing third parties to use its brands on alcohol beverages\u2014indicating a strategic contrast with its nonalcoholic segment.",
        "Step 3: From PM's 10-K, we find that both Coca-Cola and Heineken N.V. are included in the same peer group, suggesting they are considered comparable in size and global reach, which contextualizes the competitive relationship in the nonalcoholic segment.",
        "Step 4: Synthesizing all three points, we can analyze how Coca-Cola adjusts its market strategy based on beverage category, while using PM's peer group data to understand the broader competitive positioning between Coca-Cola and Heineken N.V."

          "chunk_text": "## Investments in Bottling Operations\n\nMost of our branded beverage products are prepared, packaged, distributed and sold by independent bottling partners. However, from time to time we acquire or take control of a bottling operation, often in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance. Owning a bottling operation enables us to compensate for limited local resources; help focus the bottler's sales and marketing programs; assist in the development of the bottler's business and information systems; and establish an appropriate capital structure for the bottler. In line with our long-term bottling strategy, we may periodically consider options for divesting or reducing our ownership interest in a consolidated bottling operation, typically by selling all or a portion of our interest in the bottling operation to an independent bottler to improve Coca-Cola system efficiency. When we sell a consolidated bottling operation to an independent bottling partner in which we have an equity method investment, our Company continues to participate in the bottler's results of operations through our share of the equity method investee's earnings or losses.\n\nIn addition, from time to time we make equity investments representing noncontrolling interests in selected bottling operations with the intention of maximizing the strength and efficiency of the Coca-Cola system's production, marketing, sales and distribution capabilities around the world by providing expertise and resources to strengthen those businesses. These investments are intended to result in increases in unit case volume, net revenues and profits at the bottler level, which in turn generate increased sales for our Company's concentrate operations. When our equity investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee bottler's operating and financial policies, we account for the investment under the equity method.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nSales of our ready-to-drink beverages are somewhat seasonal, with the second and third calendar quarters accounting for the highest sales volumes. The volume of sales in the beverage business may be affected by weather conditions.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe commercial beverage industry is highly competitive and consists of numerous companies, ranging from small or emerging to very large and well established. These include companies that, like our Company, compete globally in multiple geographic areas, as well as businesses that are primarily regional or local in operation. Competitive products include numerous nonalcoholic sparkling soft drinks; water products, including flavored and enhanced waters; juices, juice drinks and nectars; dilutables (including syrups and powders); coffees; teas; energy drinks; sports drinks; milk and other dairy-based drinks; plant-based beverages; functional beverages, including vitamin-based products and relaxation beverages; and various other nonalcoholic beverages. These competitive products are sold to consumers in both ready-to-drink and non-ready-to-drink form. The Company has directly entered the alcohol beverage segment in numerous markets outside the United States. In the United States, the Company has authorized alcohol-licensed third parties to use certain of our brands on alcohol beverages. Competitive products include all flavored alcohol beverages of varying alcohol bases. In many of the countries in which we do business, PepsiCo, Inc. is a primary competitor. Other significant competitors include, but are not limited to, Nestl\u00e9 S.A., Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., Danone S.A., Suntory Beverage &amp; Food Limited, Unilever, AB InBev, Kirin Holdings, Heineken N.V., Diageo and Red Bull GmbH. We also compete against numerous regional and local companies and, increasingly, against smaller companies that are developing microbrands and selling them directly to consumers through e-commerce retailers and other e-commerce platforms. In addition, in some markets, we compete against retailers that have developed their own store or private-label beverage brands.\n\nCompetitive factors impacting our business include, but are not limited to, pricing, advertising, sales promotion programs,     instore displays and point-of-sale marketing, digital marketing, product and ingredient innovation, increased efficiency in production techniques, the introduction of new packaging as well as new vending and dispensing equipment, contracting with marketing assets (theaters, sports arenas, universities, etc.), and brand and trademark development and protection.\n\nOur competitive strengths include leading brands with high levels of consumer recognition and loyalty; a worldwide network of bottlers and distributors of Company products; sophisticated marketing capabilities; and a talented group of dedicated employees. Our competitive challenges include strong competitors in all geographic regions; in many countries, a concentrated retail sector with powerful buyers able to freely choose among Company products, products of competitive beverage suppliers and individual retailers' own store or private-label beverage brands; new industry entrants; and dramatic shifts in consumer shopping methods and patterns due to a rapidly evolving digital landscape.\n\n## Raw Materials\n\nWater is a main ingredient in substantially all of our products. While historically we have not experienced significant water supply difficulties, water is a limited natural resource in many parts of the world, and our Company recognizes water availability, quality and sustainability, for both our operations and also the communities where we operate, as one of the key challenges facing our business.",

The costs of our advertising and marketing programs are expensed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Recognition  of  the  cost  related  to  our  consumer  engagement  and  trade  promotion  programs  contain  uncertainties  due  to  the  judgment required in estimating the potential performance and compliance for each program. For volume-based incentives provided to customers, management continually assesses and estimates, by customer, the likelihood of the customer's achieving the specified targets, and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made. For other trade promotions, management relies on estimated utilization rates that have been developed from historical experience. Changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual marketing program would not result in a material change in our financial position, results of operations or operating cash flows.\n\nEmployee Benefit Plans As discussed in Item 8, Note 13. Benefit Plans to our consolidated financial statements, we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees, including pensions, postretirement health care and postemployment benefits (primarily severance). We record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by U.S. GAAP. These calculations include various actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets, compensation increases, mortality, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. We review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods. We believe that the assumptions utilized in calculating our obligations under these plans are reasonable based upon our historical experience and advice from our actuaries.\n\nWeighted-average  discount  rate  assumptions  for  pension  and  postretirement  plan  obligations  at  December  31,  2021  and  2020  are  as follows:\n\n",

However, from time to time we acquire or take control of a bottling operation, often in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance. Owning a bottling operation enables us to compensate for limited local resources; help focus the bottler's sales and marketing programs; assist in the development of the bottler's business and information systems; and establish an appropriate capital structure for the bottler. In line with our long-term bottling strategy, we may periodically consider options for divesting or reducing our ownership interest in a consolidated bottling operation, typically by selling all or a portion of our interest in the bottling operation to an independent bottler to improve Coca-Cola system efficiency. When we sell a consolidated bottling operation to an independent bottling partner in which we have an equity method investment, our Company continues to participate in the bottler's results of operations through our share of the equity method investee's earnings or losses.\n\nIn addition, from time to time we make equity investments representing noncontrolling interests in selected bottling operations with the intention of maximizing the strength and efficiency of the Coca-Cola system's production, marketing, sales and distribution capabilities around the world by providing expertise and resources to strengthen those businesses. These investments are intended to result in increases in unit case volume, net revenues and profits at the bottler level, which in turn generate increased sales for our Company's concentrate operations. When our equity investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee bottler's operating and financial policies, we account for the investment under the equity method.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nSales of our ready-to-drink beverages are somewhat seasonal, with the second and third calendar quarters accounting for the highest sales volumes. The volume of sales in the beverage business may be affected by weather conditions.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe commercial beverage industry is highly competitive and consists of numerous companies, ranging from small or emerging to very large and well established. These include companies that, like our Company, compete globally in multiple geographic areas, as well as businesses that are primarily regional or local in operation. Competitive products include numerous nonalcoholic sparkling soft drinks; water products, including flavored and enhanced waters; juices, juice drinks and nectars; dilutables (including syrups and powders); coffees; teas; energy drinks; sports drinks; milk and other dairy-based drinks; plant-based beverages; functional beverages, including vitamin-based products and relaxation beverages; and various other nonalcoholic beverages. These competitive products are sold to consumers in both ready-to-drink and non-ready-to-drink form. The Company has directly entered the alcohol beverage segment in numerous markets outside the United States. In the United States, the Company has authorized alcohol-licensed third parties to use certain of our brands on alcohol beverages. Competitive products include all flavored alcohol beverages of varying alcohol bases. In many of the countries in which we do business, PepsiCo, Inc. is a primary competitor. Other significant competitors include, but are not limited to, Nestl\u00e9 S.A., Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., Danone S.A., Suntory Beverage &amp; Food Limited, Unilever, AB InBev, Kirin Holdings, Heineken N.V., Diageo and Red Bull GmbH. We also compete against numerous regional and local companies and, increasingly, against smaller companies that are developing microbrands and selling them directly to consumers through e-commerce retailers and other e-commerce platforms. In addition, in some markets, we compete against retailers that have developed their own store or private-label beverage brands.\n\nCompetitive factors impacting our business include, but are not limited to, pricing, advertising, sales promotion programs,     instore displays and point-of-sale marketing, digital marketing, product and ingredient innovation, increased efficiency in production techniques, the introduction of new packaging as well as new vending and dispensing equipment, contracting with marketing assets (theaters, sports arenas, universities, etc.), and brand and trademark development and protection.\n\nOur competitive strengths include leading brands with high levels of consumer recognition and loyalty; a worldwide network of bottlers and distributors of Company products; sophisticated marketing capabilities; and a talented group of dedicated employees. Our competitive challenges include strong competitors in all geographic regions; in many countries, a concentrated retail sector with powerful buyers able to freely choose among Company products, products of competitive beverage suppliers and individual retailers' own store or private-label beverage brands; new industry entrants; and dramatic shifts in consumer shopping methods and patterns due to a rapidly evolving digital landscape.\n\n## Raw Materials\n\nWater is a main ingredient in substantially all of our products. While historically we have not experienced significant water supply difficulties, water is a limited natural resource in many parts of the world, and our Company recognizes water availability, quality and sustainability, for both our operations and also the communities where we operate, as one of the key challenges facing our business.",

          "chunk_text": "## Investments in Bottling Operations\n\nMost of our branded beverage products are prepared, packaged, distributed and sold by independent bottling partners. However, from time to time we acquire or take control of a bottling operation, often in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance. Owning a bottling operation enables us to compensate for limited local resources; help focus the bottler's sales and marketing programs; assist in the development of the bottler's business and information systems; and establish an appropriate capital structure for the bottler. In line with our long-term bottling strategy, we may periodically consider options for divesting or reducing our ownership interest in a consolidated bottling operation, typically by selling all or a portion of our interest in the bottling operation to an independent bottler to improve Coca-Cola system efficiency. When we sell a consolidated bottling operation to an independent bottling partner in which we have an equity method investment, our Company continues to participate in the bottler's results of operations through our share of the equity method investee's earnings or losses.\n\nIn addition, from time to time we make equity investments representing noncontrolling interests in selected bottling operations with the intention of maximizing the strength and efficiency of the Coca-Cola system's production, marketing, sales and distribution capabilities around the world by providing expertise and resources to strengthen those businesses. These investments are intended to result in increases in unit case volume, net revenues and profits at the bottler level, which in turn generate increased sales for our Company's concentrate operations. When our equity investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee bottler's operating and financial policies, we account for the investment under the equity method.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nSales of our ready-to-drink beverages are somewhat seasonal, with the second and third calendar quarters accounting for the highest sales volumes. The volume of sales in the beverage business may be affected by weather conditions.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe commercial beverage industry is highly competitive and consists of numerous companies, ranging from small or emerging to very large and well established. These include companies that, like our Company, compete globally in multiple geographic areas, as well as businesses that are primarily regional or local in operation. Competitive products include numerous nonalcoholic sparkling soft drinks; water products, including flavored and enhanced waters; juices, juice drinks and nectars; dilutables (including syrups and powders); coffees; teas; energy drinks; sports drinks; milk and other dairy-based drinks; plant-based beverages; functional beverages, including vitamin-based products and relaxation beverages; and various other nonalcoholic beverages. These competitive products are sold to consumers in both ready-to-drink and non-ready-to-drink form. The Company has directly entered the alcohol beverage segment in numerous markets outside the United States. In the United States, the Company has authorized alcohol-licensed third parties to use certain of our brands on alcohol beverages. Competitive products include all flavored alcohol beverages of varying alcohol bases. In many of the countries in which we do business, PepsiCo, Inc. is a primary competitor. Other significant competitors include, but are not limited to, Nestl\u00e9 S.A., Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., Danone S.A., Suntory Beverage &amp; Food Limited, Unilever, AB InBev, Kirin Holdings, Heineken N.V., Diageo and Red Bull GmbH. We also compete against numerous regional and local companies and, increasingly, against smaller companies that are developing microbrands and selling them directly to consumers through e-commerce retailers and other e-commerce platforms. In addition, in some markets, we compete against retailers that have developed their own store or private-label beverage brands.\n\nCompetitive factors impacting our business include, but are not limited to, pricing, advertising, sales promotion programs,     instore displays and point-of-sale marketing, digital marketing, product and ingredient innovation, increased efficiency in production techniques, the introduction of new packaging as well as new vending and dispensing equipment, contracting with marketing assets (theaters, sports arenas, universities, etc.), and brand and trademark development and protection.\n\nOur competitive strengths include leading brands with high levels of consumer recognition and loyalty; a worldwide network of bottlers and distributors of Company products; sophisticated marketing capabilities; and a talented group of dedicated employees. Our competitive challenges include strong competitors in all geographic regions; in many countries, a concentrated retail sector with powerful buyers able to freely choose among Company products, products of competitive beverage suppliers and individual retailers' own store or private-label beverage brands; new industry entrants; and dramatic shifts in consumer shopping methods and patterns due to a rapidly evolving digital landscape.\n\n## Raw Materials\n\nWater is a main ingredient in substantially all of our products. While historically we have not experienced significant water supply difficulties, water is a limited natural resource in many parts of the world, and our Company recognizes water availability, quality and sustainability, for both our operations and also the communities where we operate, as one of the key challenges facing our business.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOur average warehouse space is approximately 146,000 square feet, with newer units being slightly larger. Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise, and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and low prices, our warehouses are not elaborate. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits and using a membership format, we believe our inventory losses (shrinkage) are well below those of typical retail operations.\n\nOur  warehouses  on  average  operate  on  a  seven-day,  70-hour  week.  Gasoline  operations  generally  have  extended hours. Because the hours of operation are shorter than many other retailers, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities, reducing labor required. In general, with variations by country, our warehouses accept certain credit cards, including Costco co-branded cards, debit cards, cash and checks, Executive member 2% reward certificates, co-brand cardholder rebates, and our proprietary storedvalue card (shop card).\n\nOur  strategy  is  to  provide  our  members  with  a  broad  range  of  high-quality  merchandise  at  prices  we  believe  are consistently lower than elsewhere. We seek to limit most items to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors. We carry less than 4,000 active stock keeping units (SKUs) per warehouse in our core warehouse business, significantly less than other broadline retailers. We average anywhere from 10,000 to 11,000 SKUs online, some of which are also available in our warehouses. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case, carton, or multiple-pack quantities only.\n\nIn keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain electronic items, we typically have a 90-day return policy and provide, free of charge, technical support services, as well as an extended warranty. Additional third-party warranty coverage is sold on certain electronic items.\n\nWe offer merchandise and services in the following categories:\n\n## Core Merchandise Categories (or core business):\n\n- Foods and Sundries (including sundries, dry grocery, candy, cooler, freezer, deli, liquor, and tobacco)\n- Non-Foods (including  major  appliances,  electronics,  health  and  beauty  aids,  hardware,  garden  and  patio, sporting  goods,  tires,  toys  and  seasonal,  office  supplies,  automotive  care,  postage,  tickets,  apparel,  small appliances, furniture, domestics, housewares, special order kiosk, and jewelry)\n- Fresh Foods (including meat, produce, service deli, and bakery)\n\nWarehouse Ancillary (includes gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire installation) and Other Businesses (includes e-commerce, business centers, travel, and other)\n\nWarehouse ancillary businesses operate primarily within or next to our warehouses, encouraging members to shop more frequently. The number of warehouses with gas stations varies significantly by country, and we have no gasoline business in Korea or China. We operated 668 gas stations at the end of 2022. Net sales for our gasoline business increased to approximately 14% of total net sales in 2022.\n\nOur  other  businesses  sell  products  and  services  that  complement  our  warehouse  operations  (core  and  warehouse ancillary businesses). Our e-commerce operations give members convenience and a broader selection of goods and services.  Net  sales  for  e-commerce  represented  approximately  7%  of  total  net  sales  in  2022.  This  figure  does  not include  other  services  we  offer  online  in  certain  countries  such  as  business  delivery,  travel,  same-day  grocery,  and various other services. Our business centers carry items tailored specifically for food services, convenience stores and offices, and offer walk-in shopping and deliveries. Business centers are included in our total warehouse count. Costco Travel offers vacation packages, hotels, cruises, and other travel products exclusively for Costco members (offered in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K.).",

(e)\n\nMerchandise sales - We record almost all retail store revenues at the point of sale. Digitally originated sales may include shipping revenue and are recorded upon delivery to the guest or upon guest pickup at the store. Total revenues do not include sales tax because  we  are  a  pass-through  conduit  for  collecting  and  remitting  sales  taxes.  Generally,  guests  may  return  national  brand merchandise within 90 days of purchase and owned and exclusive brands within one year of purchase. Sales are recognized net of expected returns, which we estimate using historical return patterns and our expectation of future returns. As of January 29, 2022, and January 30, 2021, the liability for estimated returns was $165 million and $139 million, respectively.\n\nWe routinely enter into arrangements with vendors whereby we do not purchase or pay for merchandise until the merchandise is ultimately sold to a guest. Under the vast majority of these arrangements, which represent less than 5 percent of consolidated sales, we record revenue and related costs gross. We concluded that we are the principal in these transactions for a number of reasons, most notably because we 1) control the overall economics of the transactions, including setting the sales price and realizing the majority of cash flows from the sale, 2) control the relationship with the customer, and 3) are responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide goods to the customer. Merchandise received under these arrangements is not included in Inventory because the purchase and sale of this inventory are virtually simultaneous.\n\nRevenue from Target gift card sales is recognized upon gift card redemption, which is typically within one year of issuance. Our gift cards  do  not  expire.  Based  on  historical  redemption  rates,  a  small  and  relatively  stable  percentage  of  gift  cards  will  never  be redeemed,  referred  to  as  \"breakage.\"  Estimated  breakage  revenue  is  recognized  over  time  in  proportion  to  actual  gift  card redemptions.\n\n2021 Form 10-K",

Failure  to  identify  and  implement  a succession plan for senior management could negatively impact our business. We must attract, train and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees, while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core values. Our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous internal and external factors, including the continuing impacts  of  the  pandemic,  regulatory  changes,  prevailing  wage  rates,  union  relations  and  healthcare  and  other insurance costs. We compete with other retail and non-retail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## We may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance.\n\nClaims  for  employee  health  care  benefits,  workers'  compensation,  general  liability,  property  damage,  directors'  and officers' liability, vehicle liability, inventory loss, and other exposures are funded predominantly through self-insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for certain  risks  to  limit  exposures  arising  from  very  large  losses. The  types  and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements. Significant claims or events, regulatory changes, a substantial rise in costs of health care or costs to maintain our insurance or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAlthough we maintain specific coverages for catastrophic property losses, we still bear a significant portion of the risk of losses incurred as a result of any physical damage to, or the destruction of, any warehouses, depots, manufacturing or home office facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption. Such losses could materially impact our cash flows and results of operations.\n\n## Market and Other External Risks\n\nWe face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe retail business is highly competitive. We compete for members, employees, sites, products and services and in other important respects with a wide range of local, regional and national wholesalers and retailers, both in the United States  and  in  foreign  countries,  including  other  warehouse-club  operators,  supermarkets,  supercenters,  internet retailers, gasoline stations, hard discounters, department and specialty stores and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise. Such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of ways, including pricing, selection and availability, services, location, convenience, store hours, and the attractiveness and ease of use of websites and mobile applications. The evolution of retailing in online and mobile channels has improved the ability of customers to comparison shop, which has enhanced competition. Some competitors have greater financial resources and technology capabilities, better access to merchandise, and greater market penetration than we do. Our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, changes in the retail markets or customer expectations could result in lost market share and negatively affect our financial results.\n\n## General  economic  factors,  domestically  and  internationally,  may  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nHigher energy and gasoline costs, inflation, levels of unemployment, healthcare costs, consumer debt levels, foreigncurrency  exchange  rates,  unsettled  financial  markets,  weaknesses  in  housing  and  real  estate  markets,  reduced consumer confidence, changes and uncertainties related to government fiscal",

      "answer": "Costco highlights that its success depends on attracting, training, and retaining a large and growing number of qualified employees while controlling labor costs, which are influenced by factors like the pandemic, regulatory changes, and healthcare costs. Failure to retain qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on Costco's business. In contrast, Target emphasizes its proactive investments in team member well-being, including bonuses, paid leave, and wellness resources during the pandemic, which likely strengthens its ability to retain talent and maintain operational efficiency. These differing approaches to labor management may affect how each company maintains its competitive position in the supermarket and warehouse club sector, with Costco facing more risk around labor cost control and retention, while Target focuses on employee support to enhance retention and differentiate itself.",

      "answer": "Costco explicitly links competitive pressures to potential market share loss by stating that its inability to respond effectively to competition\u2014particularly in areas like pricing, selection, and online capabilities\u2014could result in lost market share and negatively affect its financial results. Target, while also acknowledging competition from department stores, focuses on its ability to differentiate itself through compelling value and guest experience, without explicitly stating that failure to do so would result in market share loss. Therefore, only Costco makes a direct causal connection between competitive pressures and financial outcomes in its filing.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a (COST 10-K 2022), extract the statement: 'Our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures [...] could result in lost market share and negatively affect our financial results.'

In contrast, Walmart highlights reputational risk tied to the achievement of ESG goals, noting that failure to meet stated ESG aspirations could negatively affect public perception, associate morale, and shareholder support.

The derivatives are used as part of a broader risk mitigation strategy that includes fixed-price contracts and purchases from multiple suppliers. In contrast, WMT did not disclose a specific notional value for commodity derivatives. However, WMT's filings indicate that it manages foreign exchange risk through cross-currency interest rate swaps and foreign-denominated debt, particularly in relation to its former U.K. and Japan operations, which were divested in fiscal 2022.

If it becomes probable that the hedged transaction will not occur, we immediately recognize the related hedging gains or losses in earnings; such gains or losses reclassified during the year ended December 25, 2021 were not material.\n\nCash flows from derivatives  used  to  manage  commodity  price,  foreign  exchange  or  interest  rate  risks  are classified  as  operating  activities  in  the  cash  flow  statement.  We  classify  both  the  earnings  and  cash  flow impact from these derivatives consistent with the underlying hedged item.\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nWe perform assessments of our counterparty credit risk regularly, including reviewing netting agreements, if any,  and  a  review  of  credit  ratings,  credit  default  swap  rates  and  potential  nonperformance  of  the counterparty. Based on our most recent assessment of our counterparty credit risk, we consider this risk to be low. In addition, we enter into derivative contracts with a variety of financial institutions that we believe are creditworthy in order to reduce our concentration of credit risk.\n\nCertain of our agreements with our counterparties require us to post full collateral on derivative instruments in  a  net  liability  position  if  our  credit  rating  is  at A2  (Moody's  Investors  Service,  Inc.)  or A  (S&amp;P  Global Ratings) and we have been placed on credit watch for possible downgrade or if our credit rating falls below either of these levels. The fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of December 25, 2021 was $247 million. We have posted no collateral under these contracts and no credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered as of December 25, 2021.\n\n## Commodity Prices\n\nWe are subject to commodity price risk because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited in the competitive environment in which we operate. This risk is managed through the use of fixed-price  contracts  and  purchase  orders,  pricing  agreements  and  derivative  instruments,  which  primarily include  swaps  and  futures.  In  addition,  risk  to  our  supply  of  certain  raw  materials  is  mitigated  through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. We use derivatives, with terms of no more than three years, to hedge price fluctuations related to a portion of our anticipated commodity purchases, primarily for agricultural products, energy and metals. Derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in  corporate  unallocated  expenses  as  either  cost  of  sales  or  selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.\n\nOur  commodity  derivatives  had  a  total  notional  value  of  $1.6  billion  as  of  December  25,  2021  and  $1.1 billion as of December 26, 2020.\n\n## Foreign Exchange\n\nWe  are  exposed  to  foreign  exchange  risks  in  the  international  markets  in  which  our  products  are  made, manufactured,  distributed  or  sold.  Additionally,  we  are  exposed  to  foreign  exchange  risk  from  net investments  in  foreign  subsidiaries,  foreign  currency  purchases  and  foreign  currency  assets  and  liabilities created  in  the  normal  course  of  business.  We  manage  this  risk  through  sourcing  purchases  from  local suppliers, negotiating contracts in local currencies with foreign suppliers and through the use of derivatives, primarily forward contracts with terms of no more than two years. Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign  currency  transactions  are  recognized  as  transaction  gains  or  losses  on  our  income  statement  as incurred.  We  also  use  net  investment  hedges  to  partially  offset  the  effects  of  foreign  currency  on  our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries.",

          "chunk_text": "## Net Investment Hedges\n\nPrior to the divestiture of the Company's operations in the United Kingdom and Japan as discussed in Note 12, the Company was a party to receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross currency interest rate swaps used to hedge the currency exposure associated with net investments of these foreign operations. Changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company also previously designated certain foreign currency denominated long-term debt as a hedge of currency exposure associated with the net investment of these divested operations and recorded foreign currency gain or loss associated with designated long-term debt in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Upon closing of the sale of the Company's operations in the U.K. and Japan during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, these amounts were released from accumulated other comprehensive loss as discussed in Note 4. As of January 31, 2021, the Company had $3.3 billion of outstanding long-term debt designated as net investment hedges.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the balance sheet method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases (\"temporary differences\"). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\n\nDeferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized. Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods, and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely on estimates.\n\nIn determining the provision for income taxes, an annual effective income tax rate is used based on annual income, permanent differences between book and tax income, and statutory income tax rates. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.\n\nThe Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 9 for additional income tax disclosures.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\n## Net Sales\n\nThe Company recognizes sales revenue, net of sales taxes and estimated sales returns, at the time it sells merchandise or services to the customer. eCommerce sales include shipping revenue and are recorded upon delivery to the customer. Estimated sales returns are calculated based on expected returns.\n\n## Membership Fee Revenue\n\nThe Company recognizes membership fee revenue both in the U.S. and internationally over the term of the membership, which is typically 12 months. Membership fee revenue was $2.2 billion for fiscal 2022, $1.7 billion for fiscal 2021 and $1.5 billion for fiscal 2020, respectively. Membership fee revenue is included in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Deferred membership fee revenue is included in accrued liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Gift Cards\n\nCustomer purchases of gift cards are not recognized as sales until the card is redeemed and the customer purchases merchandise using the gift card. Gift cards in the U.S. and some countries do not carry an expiration date; therefore, customers and members can redeem their gift cards for merchandise and services indefinitely. Gift cards in some countries where the Company does business have expiration dates. While gift cards are generally redeemed within 12 months, a certain number of gift cards, both with and without expiration dates, will not be fully redeemed. Management estimates unredeemed balances and recognizes revenue for these amounts in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income over the expected redemption period.\n\n## Financial and Other Services\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue from service transactions at the time the service is performed. Generally, revenue from services is classified as a component of net sales in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.",

      "question": "How do WMT's specific net investment hedging practices compare with PEP's overall risk management approach as disclosed in their respective 2022 10-K filings?",
      "answer": "WMT's net investment hedging practices involved the use of cross-currency interest rate swaps and $3.3 billion of long-term debt designated as hedges to manage currency exposure associated with its former operations in the United Kingdom and Japan. These hedging instruments were directly tied to specific foreign operations and were adjusted upon the divestiture of those operations in fiscal 2022. In contrast, PEP's broader risk management approach includes a comprehensive framework involving multiple committees like the PepsiCo Risk Committee (PRC), division risk committees, and a dedicated Risk Management Office, which oversee a wide range of strategic, financial, and operational risks, including commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, and interest rates. PEP also uses hedging as part of its strategy, but in a more generalized way, including productivity initiatives and global purchasing programs. While WMT's hedging was specifically tied to net investments in foreign subsidiaries, PEP's approach is more systemic and integrated across all business functions, reflecting a more diversified and proactive risk oversight model.",

          "chunk_text": "## Net Investment Hedges\n\nPrior to the divestiture of the Company's operations in the United Kingdom and Japan as discussed in Note 12, the Company was a party to receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross currency interest rate swaps used to hedge the currency exposure associated with net investments of these foreign operations. Changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company also previously designated certain foreign currency denominated long-term debt as a hedge of currency exposure associated with the net investment of these divested operations and recorded foreign currency gain or loss associated with designated long-term debt in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Upon closing of the sale of the Company's operations in the U.K. and Japan during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, these amounts were released from accumulated other comprehensive loss as discussed in Note 4. As of January 31, 2021, the Company had $3.3 billion of outstanding long-term debt designated as net investment hedges.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the balance sheet method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases (\"temporary differences\"). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\n\nDeferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized. Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods, and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely on estimates.\n\nIn determining the provision for income taxes, an annual effective income tax rate is used based on annual income, permanent differences between book and tax income, and statutory income tax rates. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.\n\nThe Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 9 for additional income tax disclosures.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\n## Net Sales\n\nThe Company recognizes sales revenue, net of sales taxes and estimated sales returns, at the time it sells merchandise or services to the customer. eCommerce sales include shipping revenue and are recorded upon delivery to the customer. Estimated sales returns are calculated based on expected returns.\n\n## Membership Fee Revenue\n\nThe Company recognizes membership fee revenue both in the U.S. and internationally over the term of the membership, which is typically 12 months. Membership fee revenue was $2.2 billion for fiscal 2022, $1.7 billion for fiscal 2021 and $1.5 billion for fiscal 2020, respectively. Membership fee revenue is included in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Deferred membership fee revenue is included in accrued liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Gift Cards\n\nCustomer purchases of gift cards are not recognized as sales until the card is redeemed and the customer purchases merchandise using the gift card. Gift cards in the U.S. and some countries do not carry an expiration date; therefore, customers and members can redeem their gift cards for merchandise and services indefinitely. Gift cards in some countries where the Company does business have expiration dates. While gift cards are generally redeemed within 12 months, a certain number of gift cards, both with and without expiration dates, will not be fully redeemed. Management estimates unredeemed balances and recognizes revenue for these amounts in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income over the expected redemption period.\n\n## Financial and Other Services\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue from service transactions at the time the service is performed. Generally, revenue from services is classified as a component of net sales in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.",

      "answer": "COST's gross margin could be disproportionately affected by rising labor costs due to its reliance on a large workforce and the competitive pressure from department stores, which intensifies the need to invest in employee training and retention while managing wage rate changes and healthcare costs. PG, on the other hand, faces gross margin pressure from input cost fluctuations, particularly in petroleum-derived materials and raw materials, which are exacerbated by the competitive dynamics with department stores and the need to maintain pricing power. These distinct cost structures and competitive sensitivities lead to different financial risk profiles for each company in the context of department store competition.",

Inflation pressures sometimes result in increases in these input costs. Therefore, our business results depend, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost saving projects and sourcing decisions, while maintaining and improving margins and market share. Failure to manage these fluctuations and to anticipate consumer reaction to our management of these fluctuations could adversely impact our results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## The ability to achieve our business objectives depends on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels.\n\nThe consumer products industry is highly competitive. Across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. As a result, we experience ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate, which may result in challenges in maintaining sales and profit margins. To address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends, including pricing, promotional incentives, product delivery windows and trade terms. In addition, evolving sales channels and business models may affect customer and consumer preferences as well as market dynamics, which, for example, may be seen in the growing consumer preference for shopping online, ease of competitive entry into certain categories and growth in hard discounter channels. Failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends and effectively compete in growing sales channels and business models, particularly e-commerce and mobile or social commerce applications, could negatively impact our results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## A significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business.\n\nWe sell most of our products via retail customers, which include mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics  stores  and  professional  channels.  Our  success  depends  on  our  ability  to  successfully  manage  relationships  with  our  retail  trade  customers,  which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business, and our business performance could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer on trade terms and principles. Our business could also be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level of or shelf space allocated to our products as a result of increased offerings of other branded manufacturers, private label brands and generic non-branded products or for other reasons, significantly tighten product delivery windows or experience a significant business disruption.\n\n## If the reputation of the Company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results.\n\nThe Company's reputation, and the reputation of our brands, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including consumers, customers and suppliers. The quality and safety of our products are critical to our business. Many of our brands have worldwide recognition and our financial success directly depends on the success of our brands. The success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. Our results of operations or cash flows could also be negatively impacted if the Company or one of our brands suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to a significant product recall, product-related litigation, defects or impurities in our products, product misuse, changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients, negative perceptions of packaging (such as plastic and other petroleum-based materials), lack of recyclability  or  other  environmental  attributes,  concerns  about  actual  or  alleged  labor  or  equality  and  inclusion  practices,  privacy  failures  or  data  breaches, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. Additionally, negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the Company. If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality, ingredients, efficacy, environmental or social impacts or similar matters, sentiments toward the Company or our products could be negatively impacted, and our results of operations or cash flows could suffer.

We compete for members, employees, sites, products and serv ices and in other important respects with a wide range of local, regional and national wholesalers and retailers, both in the United States and in foreign countries, including other warehouse-club operators, supermarkets, supercenters, online retailers, gasoline stations, hard discounters, department and specialty stores and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise. Such retailers and warehouse club operators compete v igorously and in a v ariety of ways, including pricing,  selection  and  av ailability,  serv ices,  location,  conv enience,  store  hours,  and  the  attractiv eness  and  ease  of  use  of  websites  and  mobile applications. The ev olution of retailing in online and mobile channels has improv ed the ability of customers to comparison shop, which has enhanced competition. Some competitors hav e greater financial resources and technology capabilities, including the faster adoption of artificial intelligence, better access to merchandise, and greater market penetration than we do. Our inability to respond effectiv ely to competitiv e pressures, changes in the retail markets or customer expectations could result in lost market share and negativ ely affect our financial results.",

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nNOTE 1\n\n## SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## Nature of Operations\n\nThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company's (the \"Company,\" \"Procter &amp; Gamble,\" \"we\" or \"us\") business is focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior  quality  and  value.  Our  products  are  sold  in  about 180  countries  and  territories  primarily  through  mass  merchandisers,  e-commerce  (including  social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free  stores),  high-frequency  stores,  pharmacies,  electronics  stores  and  professional  channels.  We  also  sell  direct  to  consumers.  We  have  on-the-ground operations in about 70 countries.\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its controlled subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions are eliminated.\n\n## Use of E stimates\n\nPreparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future. Estimates are used in accounting for, among other items,  consumer and trade promotion accruals, restructuring reserves, pensions, postretirement benefits, stock options, valuation of acquired intangible assets, useful lives for depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets, future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain income tax  positions and contingencies. Actual results may ultimately differ from estimates, although  management  does  not  generally  believe  such  differences  would  materially  affect  the  financial  statements  in  any  individual  year.  However,  regarding ongoing impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, significant deterioration in future cash flow projections or other assumptions used in estimating fair values versus those anticipated at the time of the initial valuations, could result in impairment charges that materially affect the financial statements in a given year.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nOur revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to customers. Those sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership, risks and rewards transfer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer. A provision for payment discounts and product return allowances is recorded as a reduction of sales in the same period the revenue is recognized. The revenue recorded is presented net of sales and other taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities. The revenue includes shipping and handling costs, which generally are included in the list price to the customer.\n\nTrade  promotions,  consisting  primarily  of  customer  pricing  allowances,  merchandising  funds  and  consumer  coupons,  are  offered  through  various  programs  to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending, which is recognized as incurred at the time of the sale. Most of these arrangements have terms of approximately one year. Accruals for expected payouts under these programs are included as accrued marketing and promotion in the Accrued and other liabilities line item in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Cost of Products Sold\n\nCost of products sold is primarily comprised of direct materials and supplies consumed in the manufacturing of product, as well as manufacturing labor, depreciation expense and direct overhead expenses necessary to acquire and convert the purchased materials and supplies into finished products. Cost of products sold also includes the cost to distribute products to customers, inbound freight costs, internal transfer costs, warehousing costs and other shipping and handling activity.\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative E xpense\n\nSelling, general and administrative expense (SG &amp;A) is primarily comprised of marketing expenses, selling expenses, research and development costs, administrative and other indirect overhead costs, depreciation and amortization expense on non-manufacturing assets and other miscellaneous operating items.  Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred and were $2.0 billion in 2024, 2023 and 2022. Advertising costs, charged to expense as incurred, include television, print, radio, digital and in-store advertising ex penses and were $9.6 billion in 2024, $8.0 billion in 2023 and $7.9 billion in 2022. Non-advertising related components of the Company's total marketing spending reported in SG&amp;A include costs associated with consumer promotions, product sampling and sales aids.\n\n## Other Non-Operating Income, Net\n\nOther non-operating income, net primarily includes divestiture gains, net non-service impacts related to postretirement benefit plans, investment income, accumulated foreign currency translation losses and other non-operating items.\n\nAmounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherw ise specified.",

There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further rev iew of our capital expenditure needs and the economic env ironment.\n\n## Cash Flows from Financing Activities\n\nNet cash used in financing activ ities totaled $10,764 in 2024, compared to $2,614 in 2023. Cash flow used in financing activ ities primarily related to the payment of div idends, repayments of long-term debt and short-term borrowings, repurchases of common stock, and withholding taxes on stock-based awards. On May 18, 2024, we paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance on the 2.750% Senior Notes, using cash and cash equiv alents and shortterm inv estments. Cash flow prov ided by financing activ ities included proceeds from short-term borrowings and four Guaranteed Senior Notes totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%, issued by our Japan subsidiary.\n\n## Dividends\n\nCash dividends declared in 2024 totaled $8,589 or $19.36 per share, as compared to $1,703 or $3.84 per share in 2023. Div idends in 2024 included a special div idend of $15 per share, resulting in a payment of approximately $6,655. In April 2024, the Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash div idend from $1.02 to $1.16 per share.\n\n## Share Repurchase Program\n\nOn January 19, 2023, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program in the amount of $4,000, which expires in January 2027. During 2024 and 2023, we repurchased 1,004,000 and 1,341,000 shares of common stock, at an average price per share of $695.29 and $504.68, totaling approximately $698 and $677. These amounts may differ from the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled repurchases at the end of each fiscal year. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases, pursuant  to  plans  under  SEC  Rule  10b5-1.  Repurchased  shares  are  retired,  in  accordance  with  the  Washington  Business  Corporation  Act.

At September 1, 2024, we had borrowing capacity under these facilities  of  $1,198.  Our  international  operations  maintain  $710  of  this  capacity  under  bank  credit  facilities,  of  which  $167  is  guaranteed  by  the Company. Short-term borrowings outstanding under the bank credit facilities, which are included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\n\nWe have letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $214. T he outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of 2024 totaled $193, most of which were standby letters of credit that do not expire or hav e expiration dates within one year.  The bank credit facilities hav e v arious expiration dates, most within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities.

Net earnings, adjusted for certain non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, intangible asset impairment, share-based compensation expense, deferred income taxes and gain on sale of assets) generated approximately $19.3 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts generated $533 million of cash in the period primarily driven by an increase in trade payables and other non-cash addbacks, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in post-retirement benefit accruals. The increase in trade payables is primarily from increased marketing support activities and extended payment terms with suppliers, partially offset by lower supply chain payables due to a decrease in commodity costs. Other non-cash add-backs include the non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. The increase in Accounts Receivable is primarily from sales growth. The decrease in post-retirement benefit accruals is due to payments and the net periodic credit from other retiree benefits. Days sales outstanding increased by two days. Days inventory on hand increased by two days.\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important non-GAAP measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments. It is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding payments for the transitional tax  resulting from the U.S. Tax  Act. Adjusted free cash flow is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their at-risk compensation.\n\nAdjusted free cash flow was $16.9 billion in 2024, an increase of 21% versus the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by the increase in operating cash flows as discussed above. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the G illette intangible asset impairment charge and non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria, was 105% in 2024.\n\n## Investing Cash Flow\n\nNet investing activities used $3.5 billion of cash in 2024, primarily due to capital ex penditures and the settlement of net investment hedges.\n\n## Financing Cash Flow\n\nNet financing activities used $14.9 billion of cash in 2024, mainly due to dividends to shareholders, treasury stock purchases and a net debt decrease, partially offset by the impact of stock options and other.\n\n## Liquidity\n\nAt June 30, 2024, our current liabilities ex ceeded current assets by $8.9 billion, largely due to accounts payable, short-term borrowings and debt due within one year. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. The Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had $6.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents related to foreign subsidiaries, primarily in various European and Asian countries. We did not have material cash and cash equivalents related to any country subject to exchange controls that significantly restrict our ability to access or repatriate the funds. Under current law , we do not ex pect restrictions or tax es on repatriation of cash held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future.\n\nWe utilize short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items, such as acquisitions and share repurchases. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings, which  have  enabled  and  should  continue  to  enable  us  to  refinance  our  debt  as  it  becomes  due  in  commercial  paper  and  bond  markets.  In  addition,  we  have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient funding to meet short-term financing requirements.\n\nOn June 30, 2024, our short-term credit ratings were P-1 (Moody's) and A-1+ (Standard &amp; Poor's), while our long-term credit ratings were Aa3 (Moody's) and AA(Standard &amp; Poor's), all with a stable outlook.\n\nWe maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program. The current facility is an $8.0 billion facility split between a $3.2 billion five-year facility and a $4.8 billion 364-day facility, which ex pire in November 2028 and October 2024, respectively. Both facilities can be ex tended for certain periods of time as specified in the terms of the credit agreement. These facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain undrawn.

      "answer": "MDLZ maintains a strategy that involves using indexed U.S. equity securities as part of a broader mix that includes international equities and actively managed U.S. investment-grade fixed-income securities, which constitute 95% or more of its fixed-income holdings. Its U.S. pension plan asset allocation focuses on reducing funded status risk through monthly rebalancing as benefit payments are made. In contrast, PM utilizes indexed U.S. equity securities within a target allocation of approximately 55% in equities and 45% in debt and other assets, with rebalancing done annually or in response to contributions and benefit payments. This suggests that MDLZ takes a more frequent, active approach to managing pension risk, while PM follows a more stable, long-term equity-focused strategy.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - MDLZ uses indexed U.S. equity and international equity securities, with 95% or more of fixed-income in actively managed U.S. investment-grade securities, rebalancing monthly.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - The differing rebalancing frequencies and asset allocations imply distinct approaches to pension fund risk management between MDLZ and PM."

      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) discloses that significant additional labeling or warning requirements, such as California\u2019s Proposition 65, could negatively affect sales both in California and other markets if warnings are required on beverage products. Altria (MO) reports that excise tax increases on tobacco products have a direct adverse impact on sales volume and share performance, and as of February 24, 2025, the weighted-average state cigarette excise tax is $1.93 per pack, up from $0.36 per pack at the end of 1998.

          "chunk_text": "nutritive sweeteners and may consider similar proposals in the future. As federal, state and local governments in the United States and throughout the world experience significant budget deficits, some lawmakers have singled out beverages among a plethora of revenue-raising items and have imposed or increased, or proposed to impose or increase, sales or similar tax es on beverages, particularly sweetened beverages and alcohol beverages, as well as packaging and/or packaging materials. Increases in or the imposition of new indirect tax es on our business operations or products would increase the cost of products or, to the ex tent levied directly on consumers, make our products less affordable, which may negatively impact our net operating revenues and profitability.\n\n## Changes in laws and regulations relating to beverage containers and packaging could increase our costs and reduce demand for our products.\n\nWe and our bottlers offer, among other beverage containers, nonrefillable containers in the United States and in various other markets around the world. Legal requirements have been enacted in various jurisdictions requiring that deposits or certain ecotaxes or fees be charged in connection with the sale, marketing and use of certain beverage containers. Other proposals relating to beverage container deposits, recycling, recycling content, tethered bottle caps, ecotax and/or extended producer responsibility laws, or prohibitions on certain types of plastic products, packages and cups (including packaging containing PFAS) have been introduced and/or adopted in various jurisdictions, and we anticipate that similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at federal, state and local levels, both in the United States and elsewhere. Consumers' increased concerns and changing attitudes about solid waste streams and environmental responsibility and the related publicity could result in the adoption of additional such legislation or regulations in the future. If these types of requirements are adopted and implemented on a large scale, they could affect our costs or require changes in our distribution model, which could reduce our net operating revenues and profitability.\n\n## Significant additional labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products may inhibit sales of affected products.\n\nRegulators in the United States and abroad have been expressing concerns about the processing and the use of particular ingredients or additives in beverage products. Various jurisdictions have adopted, and others may seek to adopt, bans or restrictions on the use of certain ingredients or substances in products, as well as significant additional product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products because of what they contain or allegations that they cause adverse health effects. If these types of requirements become applicable to one or more of our products under current or future environmental or health laws or regulations, they may inhibit sales of such products or make it necessary for us to reformulate certain of our products, resulting in adverse effects on our business.\n\nFor example, under one such law in California, known as Proposition 65, if the state has determined that a substance causes cancer or harms human reproduction or development, a warning must be provided for any product sold in the state that exposes consumers to that substance, unless the exposure falls under an established safe harbor level or another exemption is applicable. For additional information regarding Proposition 65, refer to the heading 'Governmental Regulation' set forth in Part I, 'Item 1. Business' of this report. If we were required to add Proposition 65 warnings on the labels of one or more of our beverage products produced for sale in California, the resulting consumer reaction to the warnings and potential adverse publicity could negatively affect our sales both in California and in other markets.\n\n## Litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation.\n\nWe are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, those arising out of our advertising and marketing practices, product claims and labels, competition, distribution and pricing, personal data protection and privacy, intellectual property and commercial disputes, tax disputes, and environmental and employment matters. We evaluate these litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we establish reserves and/or disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from our current assessments and estimates.\n\n## We conduct business in markets with high-risk legal compliance environments, which exposes us to increased legal and reputational risk.\n\nWe have bottling and other business operations in markets with high-risk legal compliance environments. Our policies and procedures require strict compliance by our employees and agents with all United States and local laws and regulations and consent orders applicable to our business operations, including those prohibiting improper payments to government officials. Nonetheless, our policies, procedures and related training programs may not always ensure full compliance by our employees and agents with all applicable legal requirements. Improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation in the United States and internationally or lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines as well as disgorgement of profits.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nregulatory requirements, even inadvertently, and FDA enforcement actions also could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\n- Investigation and E nforcement: The FDA has a number of investigatory and enforcement tools available to it, including document requests and other required information submissions, facility inspections, facility closures, ex aminations and investigations, injunction proceedings, monetary penalties, product withdrawal and recall orders, and product seizures. Investigations or enforcement actions could result in significant costs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\n## Excise Taxes\n\nTobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes in the United States. Significant increases in tobacco-related taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted (including with respect to e-vapor products) and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted at the federal, state and local levels within the United States. The frequency and magnitude of excise tax increases can be influenced by various factors, including the composition of executive and legislative bodies.\n\nFederal, state and local cigarette ex cise tax es have increased substantially over the past two decades, far outpacing the rate of inflation. Between the end of 1998 and February 24, 2025, the weighted-average state cigarette excise tax increased from $0.36 to $1.93 per pack. Three states (Maryland, Colorado and Rhode Island) increased excise taxes in 2024. As of February 24, 2025, no states have increased excise taxes in 2025. However, various increases are under consideration or have been proposed.\n\nA majority of states currently tax  MST using an ad valorem method, which is calculated as a percentage of the price of the product, typically the wholesale price. This ad valorem method results in more tax being paid on premium products than is paid on lower-priced products of equal weight. We support legislation to convert ad valorem taxes on MST to a weight-based methodology because, unlike the ad valorem tax, a weight-based tax subjects cans of equal weight to the same tax. As of February 24, 2025, the federal government, 23 states, Puerto Rico, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Cook County, Illinois have adopted a weight-based tax methodology for MST. North Carolina has passed legislation that will cause the state to adopt a weight-based tax methodology for MST in July 2025.\n\nAn increasing number of states and localities also are imposing excise taxes on e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouches. As of February 24, 2025, 33 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and a number of cities and counties have enacted legislation to tax e-vapor products. These taxes are calculated in varying ways and may differ based on the e-vapor product form. Similarly, 13 states and the District of Columbia have enacted legislation to tax oral nicotine pouches.\n\nTax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of our operating companies' products through lower consumption levels and the potential shift in adult tobacco consumer purchases from premium to non-premium or discount cigarettes, to lower taxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products. Lower sales volume and reported share performance of our operating companies' products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position. In addition, substantial ex cise tax  increases on e-vapor and oral nicotine products may negatively impact adult smokers' transition to these products, which could materially adversely affect our innovative tobacco businesses and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\n## International Treaty on Tobacco Control\n\nThe World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (the 'FCTC') entered into force in February 2005. As of February 24, 2025, 182 countries, as well as the European Union, have become parties to the FCTC. While the United States is a signatory of the FCTC, it is not currently a party to the agreement, as the agreement has not been submitted to, or ratified by, the U.S. Senate. The FCTC is the first international public health treaty and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation. The treaty recommends (and in certain instances, requires) signatory nations to enact legislation that would address various tobacco-related issues.\n\nThere are a number of proposals currently under consideration by the governing body of the FCTC, some of which call for substantial restrictions on the manufacture, marketing, distribution and sale of tobacco products. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these proposals or the impact of any FCTC actions on legislation or regulation in the United States, either indirectly or as a result of the United States becoming a party to the FCTC, or whether or how these actions might indirectly influence FDA regulation and enforcement.\n\n## State Settlement Agreements\n\nAs discussed in Note 20, during 1997 and 1998, PM USA and other major domestic cigarette manufacturers entered into the State Settlement Agreements. These settlements require participating manufacturers to make substantial annual payments, which are adjusted for several factors, including inflation, operating income, market share and industry volume. Increases in inflation can increase our financial liability under the State Settlement Agreements. The State Settlement Agreements' inflation calculations require us to apply the higher of 3% or the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers ('CPI-U') percentage rate as published in January of each year. As of December 2024, the inflation calculation was approximately 2.9% based on the latest CPI-U data. We will continue to monitor the impact of increased inflation on the macroeconomic environment and our businesses.",

      "question": "How do California's Proposition 65 warning requirements for beverage products and digital platform restrictions on adult tobacco consumer communications each create distinct financial risks for KO and MO, and what specific operational impacts do these regulatory marketing restrictions have on product labeling and consumer engagement strategies?",
      "answer": "KO faces financial risks from California's Proposition 65, which could require warning labels on products that contain even trace amounts of listed substances, potentially inhibiting sales or necessitating product reformulation if exemptions cannot be demonstrated. This regulation directly affects KO's labeling compliance costs and could reduce consumer demand for products found to contain reportable substances. MO, on the other hand, faces operational impacts from restrictions on communications with adult tobacco consumers via third-party digital platforms, which limits their ability to engage consumers and market products effectively. These marketing limitations could reduce brand visibility and consumer engagement, directly affecting sales performance and market share. Both companies are subject to distinct financial and operational risks from health-related marketing restrictions, with KO focusing on product reformulation and compliance and MO adapting its consumer engagement strategies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - KO is subject to California's Proposition 65, which may require warning labels if trace substances are detected, potentially inhibiting sales or requiring reformulation.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - MO faces restrictions on communications with adult tobacco consumers via digital platforms, limiting marketing effectiveness and consumer engagement.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both KO and MO face financial and operational risks from marketing restrictions related to health concerns, but the nature of these restrictions differs significantly due to their product categories and regulatory environments."

While we generally purchase these raw materials from multiple suppliers and historically have not experienced significant shortages, certain packaging materials, such as aluminum cans, are available from a limited number of suppliers.\n\n## Patents, Copyrights, Trade Secrets and Trademarks\n\nOur Company owns numerous patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other know-how and technology, which we collectively refer to as 'technology.' This technology generally relates to beverage products and the processes for their production; packages and packaging materials; design and operation of processes and equipment useful for our business; and certain software. Some of the technology is licensed to suppliers and other parties. Trade secrets are an important aspect of our technology, and our sparkling beverage and other beverage formulas are among the important trade secrets of our Company.\n\nWe also own numerous trademarks that are very important to our business. Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained. Pursuant to our bottler's agreements, we authorize our bottlers to use applicable Company trademarks in connection with their preparation, packaging, distribution and sale of Company products. In addition, we authorize certain third parties to use applicable Company trademarks in connection with their preparation, packaging, distribution and sale of beverages bearing Company trademarks in certain territories. We also grant licenses to third parties from time to time to use certain of our trademarks in conjunction with certain merchandise and food products.\n\n## Governmental Regulation\n\nOur Company is required to comply, and it is our policy to comply, with all applicable laws in the countries and territories throughout the world in which we do business. In many jurisdictions, our operations may come under special scrutiny by competition law authorities due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions.\n\nIn the United States, the safety, production, storage, transportation, distribution, advertising, marketing, labeling and sale of our Company's products and their ingredients are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; the Federal Trade Commission Act; the Lanham Act; state consumer protection laws; various federal and state laws and regulations governing competition and trade practices, including the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936, as amended, and the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, as amended; federal, state and local workplace health and safety laws; various federal and state laws and regulations governing our employment practices, including those related to equal employment opportunity and compensation; various federal, state and local environmental protection laws; privacy and personal data protection laws; trade laws and regulations, including laws regarding the import or export of our products or ingredients used in our products and tariffs; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. We are also required to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act. Outside the United States, our business is subject to numerous similar statutes and regulations, as well as other legal and regulatory requirements and regulatory reviews.\n\nRegulators in the United States and abroad have been expressing concerns about processing and the use of particular ingredients or additives in beverage products. Various jurisdictions have adopted, and others may seek to adopt, bans or restrictions on the use of certain ingredients or substances in products, as well as significant additional product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products because of what they contain or allegations that they cause adverse health effects. If these types of requirements become applicable to one or more of our products under current or future environmental or health laws or regulations, they may inhibit sales of such products or make it necessary for us to reformulate certain of our products. Under the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 ('Proposition 65') of the state of California, if the state has determined that a substance causes cancer or harms human reproduction or development, a warning must be provided for any product sold in the state that exposes consumers to that substance, unless the conditions of an exemption (described below) can be met. The state maintains lists of these substances and periodically adds other substances to these lists. The detection of even a trace amount of a listed substance can subject an affected product to the requirement of a warning label. However, Proposition 65 exempts a product from a warning if the manufacturer can demonstrate that the use of that product exposes consumers to a daily quantity of a listed substance that is:\n\n- below a 'safe harbor' threshold that may be established;\n- naturally occurring;\n- the result of necessary cooking; or\n- subject to another applicable exemption.\n\nOne or more substances that are currently on the Proposition 65 list can be detected in certain Company products at low levels that are safe. The Company maintains that the presence of each such substance in Company products is subject to an applicable exemption from the warning requirement or that the product is otherwise in compliance with Proposition 65.

Additionally, the state of California may include other substances on the Proposition 65 list in the future.",

Scientific determinations as to any health risks or negative health consequences associated with the use of e-vapor and other innovative tobacco products could materially adversely affect our innovative tobacco products businesses and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\nMost jurisdictions within the United States have restricted smoking in public places and some have restricted vaping in public places. Some public health groups have called for, and various jurisdictions have adopted or proposed, bans on smoking and vaping in outdoor places, in private apartments and in cars transporting children.\n\n- Other Legislation or Governmental Initiatives: In addition to the actions discussed above, other regulatory initiatives affecting the tobacco industry have been adopted or are being considered at the federal level and in a number of state and local jurisdictions. For ex ample, in recent years, legislation has been introduced or enacted at the state or local level to subject tobacco products to various reporting requirements and performance standards; establish educational campaigns relating to tobacco consumption or tobacco control programs or provide additional funding for governmental tobacco control activities; restrict the sale of tobacco products in certain retail establishments and the sale of tobacco products in certain package sizes; prohibit the sale of tobacco products based on environmental concerns; impose responsibility on manufacturers for the disposal, recycling or other treatment of post-consumer goods such as plastic packaging; require tax stamping of smokeless tobacco products; require the use of state tax stamps using data encryption technology; and further restrict the sale, marketing and advertising of cigarettes and other tobacco products. Such legislation may be subject to constitutional or other challenges on various grounds, which may or may not be successful. In addition, if a pandemic or similar health emergency occurs, state and local governments may reimpose additional health and safety requirements for all businesses, which could result in the potential temporary closure of certain businesses and facilities. It is possible that tobacco manufacturing and other facilities and the facilities of our suppliers, our suppliers' suppliers and our trade partners could be subject to additional government-mandated temporary closures and restrictions.\n\nIt is not possible to predict what, if any, additional legislation, regulation or other governmental action will be enacted or implemented (and, if challenged, upheld) relating to the manufacturing, design, packaging, marketing, advertising, sale or use of tobacco products, or the tobacco industry generally. Any such legislation, regulation or other governmental action could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\n- Governmental Investigations: From time to time, we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters. For example, we currently are, or recently have been, subject to a number of governmental investigations with respect to our former investment in JUUL, which we divested in March 2023, including the following: (i) the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ('FTC') issued a Civil Investigative Demand to us while conducting its antitrust review of our former investment in JUUL; (ii) the SEC commenced an investigation relating to our acquisition, disclosures and accounting controls in connection with the JUUL investment; and (iii) the New York State Office of the Attorney General and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Office of the Attorney General, separately, issued independent subpoenas to us seeking documents relating to our former investment in and provision of services to JUUL. For a discussion of our disposition of our former investment in JUUL, see Note 8.\n\nIn April 2023, January 2024, February 2024 and April 2024, we agreed to settle the lawsuits relating to our former investment in JUUL initiated by the attorneys general of Minnesota, Alaska, Hawaii and New Mexico, respectively.\n\n## Private Sector Activity on Tobacco Products\n\nA number of retailers, including national chains, have discontinued the sale of all tobacco products, and others have discontinued the sale of e-vapor products. Reasons for the discontinuation include change in corporate policy and, with respect to e-vapor products, reported illnesses and the uncertain regulatory environment. Furthermore, third-party digital platforms, such as app stores, have restricted, and in some cases prohibited, communications with adult tobacco consumers concerning tobacco products. It is possible that if this private sector activity becomes more widespread it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\n## Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products\n\nIllicit trade in tobacco products has had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our businesses, including the sales volumes and market shares of our operating companies' innovative and smoke-free products and traditional tobacco products. Illicit trade can take many forms, including the sale of counterfeit tobacco products; the sale of tobacco products that do not comply with the FSPTCA and FDA regulations; the sale of tobacco products in the United States that are intended for sale outside the country; the sale of untax ed tobacco products over the Internet and by other means designed to avoid the collection of applicable taxes; and diversion into one taxing jurisdiction of tobacco products intended for sale in another. Counterfeit tobacco products, for example, are manufactured by unknown third parties in unregulated environments. Counterfeit versions of our products can negatively affect adult tobacco consumer experiences with and opinions of those brands. Illicit disposable e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products may be designed to appeal to youth and are manufactured without scientific standards, exposing consumers to undocumented risks. Illicit trade in tobacco products also harms law-abiding wholesalers and retailers by depriving them of lawful sales and undermines the significant investment we have made in legitimate distribution channels. Moreover, illicit trade in tobacco products results in federal, state and local governments losing tax revenues. Losses in tax revenues can cause such governments to take various actions, including increasing excise taxes, imposing",

We have various processes and procedures to evaluate cybersecurity threats associated with third parties, including requiring key third-party service providers to complete initial and periodic security assessments. In addition, our Global Chief Information Security Officer ('CISO') and other senior leaders regularly meet with key bottling partners to discuss cybersecurity risks and mitigation programs in order to advance risk management capabilities and proactively share cybersecurity guidelines and best practices.\n\nWe do not believe that there are currently any risks from known cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. However, we have been the target of cyberattacks and expect them to continue as cybersecurity threats have been rapidly evolving in sophistication and becoming more prevalent in the industry. We cannot eliminate all risks from cybersecurity threats or provide assurances that we have not experienced an undetected cybersecurity incident in the past or that we will not experience such an incident in the future. For more information on the risks from cybersecurity threats that we face, refer to Part I, 'Item 1A. Risk Factors.'\n\n## Cybersecurity Governance and Oversight\n\nThe Company's cybersecurity risk management program is supervised by our CISO, who reports directly to the Company's Chief Information Officer ('CIO'). The CISO and his team are responsible for leading enterprise-wide cybersecurity strategy, policy, standards, architecture and processes. Our current CISO received his Master of Business Administration degree from Columbia University and has over 25 years of cybersecurity experience, including relevant prior senior leadership positions held with three other large companies.\n\nThe CISO chairs the Company's Cybersecurity Oversight Council, a cross-functional management committee that drives awareness, ownership and alignment across broad governance and risk stakeholder groups for effective cybersecurity risk management. The Cybersecurity Oversight Council is sponsored by the Company's Global General Counsel and CIO and is composed of senior leaders from our privacy, legal, information technology, cybersecurity, internal audit, and global security and asset protection functions, among others. Subject matter experts are also invited, as appropriate. The Cybersecurity Oversight Council meets at least quarterly and has responsibility for oversight and validation of the Company's cybersecurity strategic direction, risks, threats and priorities. The Cybersecurity Oversight Council acts in alignment with the Company's Risk Steering Committee, another cross-functional management committee, which provides strategic direction and oversight over the Company's ERM program. The CISO and his team are informed about and monitor the prevention, detection, mitigation and remediation of cybersecurity incidents in accordance with the Company's cyber incident response plan.\n\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is charged with oversight of cybersecurity matters and receives regular reports from the CISO and the CIO on, among other things, the Company's cyber risks and threats, the status of projects to strengthen the Company's information security systems, assessments of the Company's security program and the emerging threat landscape. In accordance with our cybersecurity incident response plan, the Audit Committee is promptly informed by management of cybersecurity incidents with the potential to materially adversely affect the Company or its information systems and is regularly updated about incidents with lesser impact potential. The Chair of the Audit Committee regularly briefs the full Board on these matters. In addition, the Board also periodically receives cybersecurity updates directly from management.\n\nIn an effort to detect and defend against cybersecurity threats, the Company annually provides its employees with various cybersecurity and data protection training programs. These programs cover timely and relevant topics, including social engineering, phishing, deep fakes, password protection, confidential data protection, asset use and mobile security, and educate employees on the importance of reporting all incidents promptly to the Company's centrally managed cyber defense and security operations.\n\n## ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES\n\nOur worldwide headquarters is located on a 35-acre complex in Atlanta, Georgia. The complex includes several office buildings which are used by Corporate employees and North America operating segment employees. In addition, the complex includes technical and engineering facilities along with a reception center.\n\nWe own or lease additional facilities, real estate and office space throughout the world, which we use for administrative, manufacturing, processing, packaging, storage, warehousing, distribution and retail operations. These properties are generally included in the geographic operating segment in which they are located, with the exception of our Costa retail stores, which are included in the Global Ventures operating segment, and facilities related to our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are included in the Bottling Investments operating segment.",

We also leverage third parties to evaluate our cybersecurity and risk management strategy, review policies and procedures to address new risks and maintain ongoing compliance with evolving legal and regulatory requirements. For example, we partner with leading global security providers to leverage various threat intelligence channels as input to monitor and tune our cybersecurity controls.\n\n- Security Controls: We employ a layered approach to cybersecurity, implementing a range of technical and procedural controls designed to protect critical systems and data. These controls include (i) firewalls and intrusion detection and prevention systems to monitor and block unauthorized access attempts, detect and deter malicious activity and safeguard network infrastructure, (ii) encryption, including secure protocols and multi-factor authentication, to protect information in transit and at rest and (iii) secure network architecture that segregates critical systems from the public internet, limiting ex posure to potential threats. We also conduct regular security patching to manage emerging cyber threats.\n- Incident Response: We have established an incident response plan and playbooks, which include procedures designed to respond to and recover from cybersecurity incidents. These procedures, which our IT Risk Management function reviews on an ongoing basis both internally and with third-party consultants, provide detailed descriptions of the roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders and the procedures for communication and coordination during an incident. The procedures also provide guidelines for escalating information to senior management, our Disclosure Controls Committee, our Audit Committee, which, as discussed below, has been delegated cybersecurity program oversight responsibility, and our full Board and for providing timely public disclosure, when necessary.\n\nTo maintain incident readiness, business continuity and IT resilience, we conduct periodic disaster recovery exercises and cybersecurity incident management exercises led by our IT Risk Management function. These exercises involve simulating various scenarios and testing our response strategies, allowing us to identify vulnerabilities, refine procedures and enhance our overall crisis management and recovery capabilities. We believe regular practice and evaluation allows us to minimize the impact of potential disruptions and safeguard our operations, data and reputation.\n\n- Employee Awareness and Training: We recognize that employees play a critical role in maintaining a strong cybersecurity posture. Our Information Governance Policy sets forth the requirements for employee conduct relating to company information and company-managed devices, including relevant privacy, data security and data retention policies. We believe that our Information Governance Policy is aligned with industry best practices and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. In addition to our Information Governance Policy, we conduct cybersecurity training programs emphasizing the importance of cybersecurity awareness at least annually and more frequently as necessary or advisable. These programs address relevant cybersecurity topics, such as common cybersecurity threats, phishing awareness and best practices for safeguarding sensitive information. Employees are held accountable for completing all assigned cybersecurity programs and meeting certain performance thresholds in phishing awareness exercises, and there is a range of consequences for underperformance that includes termination.\n- Third-Party Risk Management: We acknowledge the potential cybersecurity risks inherent in our relationships with third-parties. Accordingly, we have implemented a third-party risk management program to identify and oversee such risks. This program relies on key elements including risk assessment, due diligence, contractual provisions and ongoing monitoring to identify and mitigate impacts from high-risk third-parties and of specific risks. We use security risk assessment questionnaire tools to identify high-risk third-parties, which we believe allows us to effectively assess and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities.\n\nOur third-party risk assessment framework evaluates the cybersecurity practices and controls of third-parties. For high-risk third-parties, we perform due diligence inquiries, reviewing documentation with respect to their security policies, incident response capabilities, data protection measures and regulatory compliance. We also review evidence of cybersecurity certifications and the results of independent audits. For high-risk third-parties with access to sensitive data or systems, we conduct more in-depth assessments. Our contracts with high-risk third-parties contain provisions related to data protection, confidentiality, incident reporting and compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Throughout our engagements with high-risk third-parties, we maintain a monitoring program with respect to their cybersecurity posture. Leveraging tools such as security questionnaires, security ratings and external threat intelligence, we regularly review and update third-party risk assessments based on changes in the third-party's services or practices and the risk landscape.\n\n## Governance\n\nOur Board devotes significant time and attention to our cybersecurity and information technology risks. Our Board executes its cybersecurity risk oversight as a whole and by delegating responsibility to our Audit Committee. Our CISO and Chief Information Officer present to our Board annually and to our Audit Committee at least twice each year on a broad range of topics, such as recent and potential cybersecurity threats and incidents across our industry, best practices and policies, emerging trends, vulnerability assessments and management's ongoing efforts to prevent, detect and address internal and external cybersecurity threats specific to us. These briefings also include reporting on periodic third-party cybersecurity program assessments and benchmarks and updates from our cybersecurity incident management exercises. Cybersecurity risks are documented in an IT Risk Dashboard, which is shared with our Audit Committee for awareness several times each year. Our full Board also has access to these materials. Finally, we provide periodic cybersecurity training to our Audit Committee and Board to further cybersecurity awareness and risk oversight.",

KO faces potential reformulation costs and sales inhibition due to Proposition 65 in California, which requires warning labels if trace amounts of listed substances are detected in their products. This could negatively impact sales or necessitate costly product reformulation. MO, on the other hand, faces financial risk from increasing excise taxes on tobacco products, including the shift from ad valorem to weight-based taxation for moist snuff, which affects premium product pricing. Additionally, MO notes that tax increases have already led to lower consumption, product switching, and potential contraband activity, all of which have a 'material adverse effect' on their business. Both companies cite regulatory scrutiny and evolving compliance costs as key financial risks, with KO highlighting potential reformulation expenses and MO detailing the financial impact of tax-driven volume declines and international treaty pressures like the FCTC.",

While we generally purchase these raw materials from multiple suppliers and historically have not experienced significant shortages, certain packaging materials, such as aluminum cans, are available from a limited number of suppliers.\n\n## Patents, Copyrights, Trade Secrets and Trademarks\n\nOur Company owns numerous patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other know-how and technology, which we collectively refer to as 'technology.' This technology generally relates to beverage products and the processes for their production; packages and packaging materials; design and operation of processes and equipment useful for our business; and certain software. Some of the technology is licensed to suppliers and other parties. Trade secrets are an important aspect of our technology, and our sparkling beverage and other beverage formulas are among the important trade secrets of our Company.\n\nWe also own numerous trademarks that are very important to our business. Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained. Pursuant to our bottler's agreements, we authorize our bottlers to use applicable Company trademarks in connection with their preparation, packaging, distribution and sale of Company products. In addition, we authorize certain third parties to use applicable Company trademarks in connection with their preparation, packaging, distribution and sale of beverages bearing Company trademarks in certain territories. We also grant licenses to third parties from time to time to use certain of our trademarks in conjunction with certain merchandise and food products.\n\n## Governmental Regulation\n\nOur Company is required to comply, and it is our policy to comply, with all applicable laws in the countries and territories throughout the world in which we do business. In many jurisdictions, our operations may come under special scrutiny by competition law authorities due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions.\n\nIn the United States, the safety, production, storage, transportation, distribution, advertising, marketing, labeling and sale of our Company's products and their ingredients are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; the Federal Trade Commission Act; the Lanham Act; state consumer protection laws; various federal and state laws and regulations governing competition and trade practices, including the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936, as amended, and the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, as amended; federal, state and local workplace health and safety laws; various federal and state laws and regulations governing our employment practices, including those related to equal employment opportunity and compensation; various federal, state and local environmental protection laws; privacy and personal data protection laws; trade laws and regulations, including laws regarding the import or export of our products or ingredients used in our products and tariffs; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. We are also required to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act. Outside the United States, our business is subject to numerous similar statutes and regulations, as well as other legal and regulatory requirements and regulatory reviews.\n\nRegulators in the United States and abroad have been expressing concerns about processing and the use of particular ingredients or additives in beverage products. Various jurisdictions have adopted, and others may seek to adopt, bans or restrictions on the use of certain ingredients or substances in products, as well as significant additional product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products because of what they contain or allegations that they cause adverse health effects. If these types of requirements become applicable to one or more of our products under current or future environmental or health laws or regulations, they may inhibit sales of such products or make it necessary for us to reformulate certain of our products. Under the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 ('Proposition 65') of the state of California, if the state has determined that a substance causes cancer or harms human reproduction or development, a warning must be provided for any product sold in the state that exposes consumers to that substance, unless the conditions of an exemption (described below) can be met. The state maintains lists of these substances and periodically adds other substances to these lists. The detection of even a trace amount of a listed substance can subject an affected product to the requirement of a warning label. However, Proposition 65 exempts a product from a warning if the manufacturer can demonstrate that the use of that product exposes consumers to a daily quantity of a listed substance that is:\n\n- below a 'safe harbor' threshold that may be established;\n- naturally occurring;\n- the result of necessary cooking; or\n- subject to another applicable exemption.\n\nOne or more substances that are currently on the Proposition 65 list can be detected in certain Company products at low levels that are safe. The Company maintains that the presence of each such substance in Company products is subject to an applicable exemption from the warning requirement or that the product is otherwise in compliance with Proposition 65. However, the state of California and other parties have in the past taken a contrary position and may do so in the future. Additionally, the state of California may include other substances on the Proposition 65 list in the future.",

Investigations or enforcement actions could result in significant costs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\n## Excise Taxes\n\nTobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes in the United States. Significant increases in tobacco-related taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted (including with respect to e-vapor products) and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted at the federal, state and local levels within the United States. The frequency and magnitude of excise tax increases can be influenced by various factors, including the composition of executive and legislative bodies.\n\nFederal, state and local cigarette ex cise tax es have increased substantially over the past two decades, far outpacing the rate of inflation. Between the end of 1998 and February 24, 2025, the weighted-average state cigarette excise tax increased from $0.36 to $1.93 per pack. Three states (Maryland, Colorado and Rhode Island) increased excise taxes in 2024. As of February 24, 2025, no states have increased excise taxes in 2025. However, various increases are under consideration or have been proposed.\n\nA majority of states currently tax  MST using an ad valorem method, which is calculated as a percentage of the price of the product, typically the wholesale price. This ad valorem method results in more tax being paid on premium products than is paid on lower-priced products of equal weight. We support legislation to convert ad valorem taxes on MST to a weight-based methodology because, unlike the ad valorem tax, a weight-based tax subjects cans of equal weight to the same tax. As of February 24, 2025, the federal government, 23 states, Puerto Rico, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Cook County, Illinois have adopted a weight-based tax methodology for MST. North Carolina has passed legislation that will cause the state to adopt a weight-based tax methodology for MST in July 2025.\n\nAn increasing number of states and localities also are imposing excise taxes on e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouches. As of February 24, 2025, 33 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and a number of cities and counties have enacted legislation to tax e-vapor products. These taxes are calculated in varying ways and may differ based on the e-vapor product form. Similarly, 13 states and the District of Columbia have enacted legislation to tax oral nicotine pouches.\n\nTax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of our operating companies' products through lower consumption levels and the potential shift in adult tobacco consumer purchases from premium to non-premium or discount cigarettes, to lower taxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products. Lower sales volume and reported share performance of our operating companies' products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position. In addition, substantial ex cise tax  increases on e-vapor and oral nicotine products may negatively impact adult smokers' transition to these products, which could materially adversely affect our innovative tobacco businesses and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\n## International Treaty on Tobacco Control\n\nThe World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (the 'FCTC') entered into force in February 2005. As of February 24, 2025, 182 countries, as well as the European Union, have become parties to the FCTC. While the United States is a signatory of the FCTC, it is not currently a party to the agreement, as the agreement has not been submitted to, or ratified by, the U.S. Senate. The FCTC is the first international public health treaty and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation. The treaty recommends (and in certain instances, requires) signatory nations to enact legislation that would address various tobacco-related issues.\n\nThere are a number of proposals currently under consideration by the governing body of the FCTC, some of which call for substantial restrictions on the manufacture, marketing, distribution and sale of tobacco products. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these proposals or the impact of any FCTC actions on legislation or regulation in the United States, either indirectly or as a result of the United States becoming a party to the FCTC, or whether or how these actions might indirectly influence FDA regulation and enforcement.\n\n## State Settlement Agreements\n\nAs discussed in Note 20, during 1997 and 1998, PM USA and other major domestic cigarette manufacturers entered into the State Settlement Agreements. These settlements require participating manufacturers to make substantial annual payments, which are adjusted for several factors, including inflation, operating income, market share and industry volume. Increases in inflation can increase our financial liability under the State Settlement Agreements. The State Settlement Agreements' inflation calculations require us to apply the higher of 3% or the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers ('CPI-U') percentage rate as published in January of each year. As of December 2024, the inflation calculation was approximately 2.9% based on the latest CPI-U data. We will continue to monitor the impact of increased inflation on the macroeconomic environment and our businesses.",

      "question": "How do the regulatory marketing restrictions affecting Coca-Cola (KO) and Philip Morris (MO) differ in terms of their potential impact on product reformulation and consumer perception, based on the specific regulatory examples provided in their 2024 10-K filings?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola faces potential product reformulation and consumer perception risks due to Proposition 65 in California, which could require warning labels on beverages containing substances linked to cancer or reproductive harm. If such warnings were required, they could negatively affect sales both in California and other markets. Philip Morris, on the other hand, faces marketing restrictions related to public health concerns around e-vapor and tobacco products, including bans on public vaping and smoking, and potential new legislation that could further restrict the sale, marketing, and advertising of tobacco products. These restrictions could materially affect Philip Morris\u2019s ability to market its products and influence consumer attitudes toward tobacco use. Both companies face regulatory-driven changes in consumer behavior, but the nature of the products and the regulatory environments differ significantly, leading to distinct reformulation and reputational risks.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from KO's 10-K - Coca-Cola could be required to add Proposition 65 warnings on beverage labels in California, which could negatively affect sales both in California and other markets.",
        "Step 2: Extract from MO's 10-K - Philip Morris faces potential bans on public vaping and smoking, and new legislation could restrict the sale, marketing, and advertising of tobacco products, which could materially affect its business.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies face marketing restrictions due to regulatory requirements, but the nature of these restrictions differs: KO faces labeling requirements that could deter consumers from purchasing beverages, while MO faces broader marketing and usage restrictions tied to public health concerns around tobacco products. These differences lead to distinct reformulation and consumer perception risks."

          "chunk_text": "nutritive sweeteners and may consider similar proposals in the future. As federal, state and local governments in the United States and throughout the world experience significant budget deficits, some lawmakers have singled out beverages among a plethora of revenue-raising items and have imposed or increased, or proposed to impose or increase, sales or similar tax es on beverages, particularly sweetened beverages and alcohol beverages, as well as packaging and/or packaging materials. Increases in or the imposition of new indirect tax es on our business operations or products would increase the cost of products or, to the ex tent levied directly on consumers, make our products less affordable, which may negatively impact our net operating revenues and profitability.\n\n## Changes in laws and regulations relating to beverage containers and packaging could increase our costs and reduce demand for our products.\n\nWe and our bottlers offer, among other beverage containers, nonrefillable containers in the United States and in various other markets around the world. Legal requirements have been enacted in various jurisdictions requiring that deposits or certain ecotaxes or fees be charged in connection with the sale, marketing and use of certain beverage containers. Other proposals relating to beverage container deposits, recycling, recycling content, tethered bottle caps, ecotax and/or extended producer responsibility laws, or prohibitions on certain types of plastic products, packages and cups (including packaging containing PFAS) have been introduced and/or adopted in various jurisdictions, and we anticipate that similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at federal, state and local levels, both in the United States and elsewhere. Consumers' increased concerns and changing attitudes about solid waste streams and environmental responsibility and the related publicity could result in the adoption of additional such legislation or regulations in the future. If these types of requirements are adopted and implemented on a large scale, they could affect our costs or require changes in our distribution model, which could reduce our net operating revenues and profitability.\n\n## Significant additional labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products may inhibit sales of affected products.\n\nRegulators in the United States and abroad have been expressing concerns about the processing and the use of particular ingredients or additives in beverage products. Various jurisdictions have adopted, and others may seek to adopt, bans or restrictions on the use of certain ingredients or substances in products, as well as significant additional product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products because of what they contain or allegations that they cause adverse health effects. If these types of requirements become applicable to one or more of our products under current or future environmental or health laws or regulations, they may inhibit sales of such products or make it necessary for us to reformulate certain of our products, resulting in adverse effects on our business.\n\nFor example, under one such law in California, known as Proposition 65, if the state has determined that a substance causes cancer or harms human reproduction or development, a warning must be provided for any product sold in the state that exposes consumers to that substance, unless the exposure falls under an established safe harbor level or another exemption is applicable. For additional information regarding Proposition 65, refer to the heading 'Governmental Regulation' set forth in Part I, 'Item 1. Business' of this report. If we were required to add Proposition 65 warnings on the labels of one or more of our beverage products produced for sale in California, the resulting consumer reaction to the warnings and potential adverse publicity could negatively affect our sales both in California and in other markets.\n\n## Litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation.\n\nWe are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, those arising out of our advertising and marketing practices, product claims and labels, competition, distribution and pricing, personal data protection and privacy, intellectual property and commercial disputes, tax disputes, and environmental and employment matters. We evaluate these litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we establish reserves and/or disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from our current assessments and estimates.\n\n## We conduct business in markets with high-risk legal compliance environments, which exposes us to increased legal and reputational risk.\n\nWe have bottling and other business operations in markets with high-risk legal compliance environments. Our policies and procedures require strict compliance by our employees and agents with all United States and local laws and regulations and consent orders applicable to our business operations, including those prohibiting improper payments to government officials. Nonetheless, our policies, procedures and related training programs may not always ensure full compliance by our employees and agents with all applicable legal requirements. Improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation in the United States and internationally or lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines as well as disgorgement of profits.",

Scientific determinations as to any health risks or negative health consequences associated with the use of e-vapor and other innovative tobacco products could materially adversely affect our innovative tobacco products businesses and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\nMost jurisdictions within the United States have restricted smoking in public places and some have restricted vaping in public places. Some public health groups have called for, and various jurisdictions have adopted or proposed, bans on smoking and vaping in outdoor places, in private apartments and in cars transporting children.\n\n- Other Legislation or Governmental Initiatives: In addition to the actions discussed above, other regulatory initiatives affecting the tobacco industry have been adopted or are being considered at the federal level and in a number of state and local jurisdictions. For ex ample, in recent years, legislation has been introduced or enacted at the state or local level to subject tobacco products to various reporting requirements and performance standards; establish educational campaigns relating to tobacco consumption or tobacco control programs or provide additional funding for governmental tobacco control activities; restrict the sale of tobacco products in certain retail establishments and the sale of tobacco products in certain package sizes; prohibit the sale of tobacco products based on environmental concerns; impose responsibility on manufacturers for the disposal, recycling or other treatment of post-consumer goods such as plastic packaging; require tax stamping of smokeless tobacco products; require the use of state tax stamps using data encryption technology; and further restrict the sale, marketing and advertising of cigarettes and other tobacco products. Such legislation may be subject to constitutional or other challenges on various grounds, which may or may not be successful. In addition, if a pandemic or similar health emergency occurs, state and local governments may reimpose additional health and safety requirements for all businesses, which could result in the potential temporary closure of certain businesses and facilities. It is possible that tobacco manufacturing and other facilities and the facilities of our suppliers, our suppliers' suppliers and our trade partners could be subject to additional government-mandated temporary closures and restrictions.\n\nIt is not possible to predict what, if any, additional legislation, regulation or other governmental action will be enacted or implemented (and, if challenged, upheld) relating to the manufacturing, design, packaging, marketing, advertising, sale or use of tobacco products, or the tobacco industry generally. Any such legislation, regulation or other governmental action could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\n- Governmental Investigations: From time to time, we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters. For example, we currently are, or recently have been, subject to a number of governmental investigations with respect to our former investment in JUUL, which we divested in March 2023, including the following: (i) the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ('FTC') issued a Civil Investigative Demand to us while conducting its antitrust review of our former investment in JUUL; (ii) the SEC commenced an investigation relating to our acquisition, disclosures and accounting controls in connection with the JUUL investment; and (iii) the New York State Office of the Attorney General and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Office of the Attorney General, separately, issued independent subpoenas to us seeking documents relating to our former investment in and provision of services to JUUL. For a discussion of our disposition of our former investment in JUUL, see Note 8.\n\nIn April 2023, January 2024, February 2024 and April 2024, we agreed to settle the lawsuits relating to our former investment in JUUL initiated by the attorneys general of Minnesota, Alaska, Hawaii and New Mexico, respectively.\n\n## Private Sector Activity on Tobacco Products\n\nA number of retailers, including national chains, have discontinued the sale of all tobacco products, and others have discontinued the sale of e-vapor products. Reasons for the discontinuation include change in corporate policy and, with respect to e-vapor products, reported illnesses and the uncertain regulatory environment. Furthermore, third-party digital platforms, such as app stores, have restricted, and in some cases prohibited, communications with adult tobacco consumers concerning tobacco products. It is possible that if this private sector activity becomes more widespread it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\n## Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products\n\nIllicit trade in tobacco products has had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our businesses, including the sales volumes and market shares of our operating companies' innovative and smoke-free products and traditional tobacco products. Illicit trade can take many forms, including the sale of counterfeit tobacco products; the sale of tobacco products that do not comply with the FSPTCA and FDA regulations; the sale of tobacco products in the United States that are intended for sale outside the country; the sale of untax ed tobacco products over the Internet and by other means designed to avoid the collection of applicable taxes; and diversion into one taxing jurisdiction of tobacco products intended for sale in another. Counterfeit tobacco products, for example, are manufactured by unknown third parties in unregulated environments. Counterfeit versions of our products can negatively affect adult tobacco consumer experiences with and opinions of those brands. Illicit disposable e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products may be designed to appeal to youth and are manufactured without scientific standards, exposing consumers to undocumented risks. Illicit trade in tobacco products also harms law-abiding wholesalers and retailers by depriving them of lawful sales and undermines the significant investment we have made in legitimate distribution channels. Moreover, illicit trade in tobacco products results in federal, state and local governments losing tax revenues. Losses in tax revenues can cause such governments to take various actions, including increasing excise taxes, imposing",

Under the vast majority of these arrangements, which represent less than 5 percent of consolidated sales, we record revenue and related costs gross. We concluded that we are the principal in these transactions for a number of reasons, most notably because we 1) control the overall economics of the transactions, including setting the sales price and realizing the majority of cash flows from the sale, 2) control the relationship with the customer, and 3) are responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide goods to the customer.

However, the evidence does not explicitly quantify the proportion of beverage-related merchandise within TGT's operations.

        "Step 2: Analyze TGT's evidence_source_b to determine if a specific proportion of beverage-related merchandise is quantified - The evidence mentions that beverages are part of TGT's food and beverage segment but does not provide a specific revenue figure or percentage for beverage-related merchandise.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While both companies are involved in the beverage space, the evidence only provides a concrete financial figure for MDLZ. For TGT, the lack of explicit quantification prevents a comparative financial analysis."

(e)\n\nMerchandise sales - We record almost all retail store revenues at the point of sale. Digitally originated sales may include shipping revenue and are recorded upon delivery to the guest or upon guest pickup at the store. Total revenues do not include sales tax because  we  are  a  pass-through  conduit  for  collecting  and  remitting  sales  taxes.  Generally,  guests  may  return  national  brand merchandise within 90 days of purchase and owned and exclusive brands within one year of purchase. Sales are recognized net of expected returns, which we estimate using historical return patterns and our expectation of future returns. As of January 29, 2022, and January 30, 2021, the liability for estimated returns was $165 million and $139 million, respectively.\n\nWe routinely enter into arrangements with vendors whereby we do not purchase or pay for merchandise until the merchandise is ultimately sold to a guest. Under the vast majority of these arrangements, which represent less than 5 percent of consolidated sales, we record revenue and related costs gross. We concluded that we are the principal in these transactions for a number of reasons, most notably because we 1) control the overall economics of the transactions, including setting the sales price and realizing the majority of cash flows from the sale, 2) control the relationship with the customer, and 3) are responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide goods to the customer. Merchandise received under these arrangements is not included in Inventory because the purchase and sale of this inventory are virtually simultaneous.\n\nRevenue from Target gift card sales is recognized upon gift card redemption, which is typically within one year of issuance. Our gift cards  do  not  expire.  Based  on  historical  redemption  rates,  a  small  and  relatively  stable  percentage  of  gift  cards  will  never  be redeemed,  referred  to  as  \"breakage.\"  Estimated  breakage  revenue  is  recognized  over  time  in  proportion  to  actual  gift  card redemptions.\n\n2021 Form 10-K",

      "answer": "The shared inclusion of Kimberly-Clark Corporation in the peer groups of both Colgate-Palmolive and Philip Morris indicates that analysts likely benchmark these companies based on their global presence and similar revenue scales, rather than product-specific categories. Colgate-Palmolive's 2023 peer group update explicitly aimed to emphasize companies with significant international operations in oral care, personal care, and home care, while reducing the influence of U.S.-focused food companies. This aligns with the global consumer products focus shared by Kimberly-Clark and Colgate-Palmolive. Similarly, Philip Morris includes Kimberly-Clark in its peer group after evaluating companies based on global presence, consumer product focus, and similar net revenues and market capitalization. These shared criteria suggest that analysts view these firms as operating within comparable global, consumer-driven markets, and use peer group composition to assess competitive positioning and financial performance across diverse but similarly scaled consumer staples businesses.",

      "question": "How does the alignment with TCFD recommendations influence both Colgate-Palmolive and Philip Morris International in terms of their sustainability reporting and climate-related risk assessment strategies, respectively?",
      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive aligns its climate and sustainability efforts with TCFD recommendations by publishing reports that detail its 2022 Sustainability and Social Impact Report and 2023 Climate Transition & Net Zero Action Plan, which are publicly accessible on its website. These reports are part of the company\u2019s broader sustainability disclosures that include metrics on TRUE-certified sites, reaching 36 sites across 21 countries by the end of 2023. On the other hand, Philip Morris International (PMI) incorporates TCFD recommendations into its climate-related risk assessment process, actively monitoring the potential impact of climate-related regulations and frameworks such as the EU Emissions Trading System, the Paris Climate Agreement, and the SEC\u2019s proposed climate-related disclosure rules. PMI uses the TCFD framework to guide its understanding and response to climate-related financial risks, ensuring preparedness for evolving regulatory landscapes. Therefore, while Colgate-Palmolive uses TCFD alignment to enhance transparency and public reporting on sustainability achievements, PMI integrates TCFD guidance into its strategic risk assessment to anticipate and adapt to regulatory changes.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Colgate-Palmolive explicitly aligns with TCFD recommendations and provides detailed sustainability reports, including 36 TRUE-certified sites by 2023.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Philip Morris International actively monitors climate-related regulations and incorporates TCFD recommendations into its climate risk assessment process.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies use TCFD recommendations, but for different strategic purposes: Colgate focuses on public sustainability reporting and achievements, while PMI integrates TCFD into assessing and managing climate-related financial risks."

      "question": "Given PG's use of financial hedging instruments like futures and options to manage commodity price exposure, what risk management vulnerabilities might CL face during periods of significant commodity price volatility?",
      "answer": "CL faces potential earnings instability and margin pressure during commodity price volatility since it does not disclose using financial hedging instruments like PG. PG specifically mentions using futures, options, and swap contracts to manage raw material price volatility, while CL only references general exposure to economic conditions affecting commodity prices. This lack of active financial hedging leaves CL more exposed to unpredictable cost increases that could compress margins and disrupt cash flows, especially compared to PG's structured approach that includes both natural hedging through diversified exposures and financial instruments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From CL's filing, we learn they face commodity price exposure but do not disclose using any financial hedging mechanisms to manage this risk.",
        "Step 2: From PG's filing, we learn they specifically use futures, options, and swap contracts to manage commodity price volatility, in addition to natural hedging through diversified exposures.",
        "Step 3: Synthesizing both, we identify that CL lacks the financial hedging protections explicitly mentioned in PG's risk management strategy, leaving CL more vulnerable to commodity price swings that could negatively impact earnings stability and cash flows."

      "answer": "CL's exposure to international competition is heightened due to two-thirds of its net sales originating in markets outside the U.S., making it particularly vulnerable to strong local competitors in those regions. This is explicitly stated in CL's 10-K filing as a significant challenge impacting its business. PG also identifies competition from both local and global competitors as a material risk factor, indicating that competitive pressures are a shared concern across the industry. However, PG does not specify the geographic breakdown of its competitive pressures, unlike CL, which clearly quantifies its international exposure. As a result, CL's risk from local competitors is more geographically concentrated and explicitly detailed, whereas PG's competitive risk is framed in broader terms without specific international emphasis.",

      "question": "Colgate-Palmolive notes that competitive activity from local competitors has included increased promotional spending and geographic expansion, while Procter & Gamble emphasizes its positioning across multiple price tiers (super-premium, premium, mid-tier, and value-tier). How do these competitive dynamics influence each company's strategy in maintaining or growing market share in price-tiered consumer staples segments?",
      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive faces competitive pressures from local competitors who are engaging in more aggressive promotional spending and geographic expansion, which threatens its market share. In response, Colgate-Palmolive is investing in brand support, digital and analytics capabilities, and offering products across multiple price points to retain consumers and prevent switching to lower-cost alternatives. Meanwhile, Procter & Gamble explicitly states it is well-positioned across multiple price tiers \u2014 including super-premium, premium, mid-tier, and value-tier products \u2014 allowing it to compete more effectively in segmented markets. This multi-tiered brand positioning enables P&G to defend and grow its market share by appealing to a broader consumer base facing varying economic pressures. The combination of Colgate-Palmolive\u2019s defensive strategy and P&G\u2019s tiered-market approach reflects how both companies are adapting to intensified local competition in the consumer staples sector.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from CL_10k_2023.pdf:page_31:chunk_1 - Colgate-Palmolive mentions that local competitors are engaging in 'more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges, as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion.' This indicates intensified local competition.",
        "Step 2: Extract from PG_10k_2023.pdf:page_17:chunk_1 - Procter & Gamble states that many of its product segments are differentiated by price tiers (super-premium, premium, mid-tier, and value-tier) and that the company believes it is 'well-positioned' across these tiers.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies operate in the same competitive environment with strong local players. Colgate-Palmolive is responding defensively by reinforcing brand loyalty and offering multi-price-point products, while P&G is leveraging its explicit presence across all price tiers to capture diverse consumer segments. The influence of local competitors directly shapes both companies\u2019 strategies to maintain or grow market share in a segmented market."

      "question": "Considering both Colgate-Palmolive (CL) and Procter & Gamble (PG) rely on third-party partners for critical aspects of their operations, how would a widespread financial crisis affecting these partners impact the combined cash flow projections of both companies, given their stated liquidity exposures?",
      "answer": "A widespread financial crisis affecting third-party partners would likely have a significant negative impact on the combined cash flow projections of both Colgate-Palmolive and Procter & Gamble. Colgate-Palmolive notes that third-party partners, including suppliers and logistics providers, facing financial or operational difficulties could disrupt the timely delivery of products and materials, and could also lead to difficulties in collecting accounts receivables. Similarly, Procter & Gamble highlights that financial hardships among suppliers or third-party partners could prevent them from providing necessary materials and services, directly impacting their supply chain and cash flows. Both companies also note exposure to disruptions in credit markets and reliance on banking partners, which could further impair liquidity. Therefore, a systemic crisis among third-party partners would likely reduce cash inflows and increase cash outflows for both firms, negatively affecting their combined cash flow outlook.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Colgate-Palmolive notes that third-party partners facing financial difficulties may impact their ability to provide materials and services, and that collecting accounts receivables could become more difficult.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Procter & Gamble states that financial hardships among suppliers or third-party partners could prevent them from providing necessary materials and services, directly affecting their operations and cash flows.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies depend on financially stable third-party partners for operational continuity and cash flow stability. A widespread financial crisis among these partners would disrupt both companies' operations and liquidity, negatively affecting their combined cash flow projections."

      "question": "How does the difference in disclosure approach regarding supplier finance programs between CL and PG reflect on their respective financial reporting strategies, considering CL includes outstanding obligations in Accounts Payable while PG does not highlight materiality concerns in its filing?",
      "answer": "CL explicitly states that its outstanding payment obligations under supplier finance programs are included in Accounts Payable and emphasizes that these amounts were not material as of December 31, 2023, or 2022. PG also addresses supplier finance programs, placing them in a dedicated note (Note 14), but does not include a specific disclosure about the materiality of outstanding obligations. This difference in reporting strategies suggests that CL places greater emphasis on transparency around the financial impact of supplier financing decisions, while PG treats the program more as a standard accounting policy without highlighting potential balance sheet effects. Both companies maintain that their obligations to suppliers remain unchanged regardless of supplier financing choices.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - CL includes outstanding obligations under supplier finance programs in Accounts Payable and notes they are not material as of December 31, 2023 or 2022.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - The contrast in disclosure depth indicates differing financial reporting strategies: CL emphasizes materiality and balance sheet integration, while PG treats the program as a standard policy without materiality commentary."

Net  cash  flows  from  investing  activities  also  includes  purchases  and  maturities  of  short-term investments.\n\n## Capital Expenditures\n\nOur primary requirements for capital are acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations, and  working  capital.  In  2022,  we  spent  $3,891  on  capital  expenditures,  and  it  is  our  current  intention  to  spend approximately $3,800 to $4,000 during fiscal 2023. These expenditures are expected to be financed with cash from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. We opened 26 new warehouses, including three  relocations,  in  2022,  and  plan  to  open  approximately  up  to  29  additional  new  warehouses,  including  four relocations, in 2023. There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs or based on the economic environment.\n\n## Cash Flows from Financing Activities\n\nNet cash used in financing activities totaled $4,283 in 2022, compared to $6,488 in 2021. Cash flows used in financing activities primarily related to the payment of dividends, payments to our former joint-venture partner for a dividend and the  purchase  of  their  equity  interest  in  Taiwan,  totaling  $1,050  in  the  aggregate,  repayments  of  our  2.300%  Senior Notes, repurchases of common stock, and withholding taxes on stock awards.\n\n## Stock Repurchase Programs\n\nDuring 2022 and 2021, we repurchased 863,000 and 1,358,000 shares of common stock, at average prices of $511.46 and  $364.39,  respectively,  totaling  approximately  $442  and  $495,  respectively.  These  amounts  may  differ  from  the stock repurchase balances in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of each fiscal year. Purchases are made from time-to-time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $2,808 at the end of 2022.\n\n## Dividends\n\nCash dividends declared in 2022 totaled $3.38 per share, as compared to $12.98 per share in 2021. Dividends in 2021 included  a  special  dividend  of  $10.00  per  share,  aggregating  approximately  $4,430.  In  April  2022,  the  Board  of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.79 to $0.90 per share.\n\n## Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs\n\nWe maintain bank credit  facilities  for  working  capital  and  general  corporate  purposes. At August  28,  2022,  we  had borrowing capacity under these facilities of $1,257. Our international operations maintain $773 of this capacity under bank credit facilities, of which $176 is guaranteed by the Company. Short-term borrowings outstanding under the bank credit facilities were $88 and $41 at the end of 2022 and 2021.\n\nThe Company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $224. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of 2022 totaled $184, most of which were standby letters of credit that do not expire or have expiration dates within one year. The bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, most within one year, and we generally intend to renew these",

          "chunk_text": "Acquisitions. Acquisition activity used cash of $1.4 billion in 2022,  primarily  related  to  Beauty  acquisitions  of  Farmacy Beauty, Ouai and TULA. Acquisition activity used $34 million in 2021, primarily related to a minor Health Care acquisition.\n\nProceeds from Divestitures and Other Asset Sales. Proceeds from asset sales were $110 million in 2022 and $42 million in 2021,  primarily from  fixed asset  sales  and  minor  brand divestitures.\n\nInvestment  Securities. Investments  provided  net  cash  of  $3 million  in  2022  primarily  from  the  sale  of  other  investments and  used  cash  of  $55  million  in  2021  primarily  from  the purchase of investment securities.\n\n## Financing Cash Flow\n\nNet  financing  activities  consumed  $14.9  billion  of  cash  in 2022, mainly due to treasury stock purchases and dividends to shareholders,  partially  offset  by  a  net  debt  increase  and  the impact of proceeds received from stock option exercises. Net financing  activities  consumed  $21.5  billion  in  cash  in  2021, mainly due to treasury stock purchases, dividends to shareholders  and  a  net  debt  reduction,  partially  offset  by  the impact of stock options.\n\nDividend  Payments. Our  first  discretionary  use  of  cash  is dividend  payments.  Dividends  per  common  share  increased 9% to $3.5227 per share in 2022. Total dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders were $8.8 billion in 2022 and $8.3 billion in 2021. In April 2022, the Board of Directors declared a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.8698 to  $0.9133  per  share  on  Common  Stock  and  Series A  and  B Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) Convertible Class A Preferred  Stock.  This  is  the  66th  consecutive  year  that  our dividend  has  increased.  We  have  paid  a  dividend  for  132 consecutive years, every year since our incorporation in 1890.\n\nLong-Term and Short-Term Debt. We maintain debt levels we consider  appropriate  after  evaluating  a  number  of  factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions  and  share  repurchase  activities)  and  the  overall cost  of  capital.  Total  debt  was  $31.5  billion  as  of  June  30, 2022, and $32.0 billion as of June 30, 2021. We generated $1.9 billion  from  net  debt  increases,  primarily  due  to  issuance  of bonds. In 2021, we used $3.9 billion for net debt reductions, including  $512  million  for  early  debt  extinguishment  costs related to the early retirement of $2.3 billion of debt.\n\nTreasury  Purchases. Total  share  repurchases  were  $10.0 billion in 2022 and $11.0 billion in 2021.\n\nImpact  of  Stock  Options  and  Other. The  exercise  of  stock options  and  other  financing  activities  generated  $2.0  billion and $1.6 billion of cash in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n## Liquidity\n\nAt  June  30,  2022,  our  current  liabilities  exceeded  current assets  by  $11.4  billion,  largely  due  to  short-term  borrowings under our commercial paper program. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations.  The  Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs. As of June 30, 2022, the Company had $5.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents related to foreign subsidiaries, primarily in various Western European and Asian countries. We did not have material cash and cash equivalents related  to  any  country  subject  to  exchange  controls  that significantly  restrict  our  ability  to  access  or  repatriate  the funds.  Under  current  law,  we  do  not  expect  restrictions  or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future.\n\nWe  utilize  short-  and  long-term  debt  to  fund  discretionary items,  such  as  acquisitions  and  share  repurchases.  We  have strong short- and long-term debt ratings, which have enabled, and should continue to enable, us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient funding to meet short-term financing requirements.\n\nOn  June  30,  2022,  our  short-term  credit  ratings  were  P-1 (Moody's) and A-1+ (Standard &amp; Poor's), while our long-term credit  ratings  were  Aa3  (Moody's)  and  AA-  (Standard  &amp; Poor's), all with a stable outlook.\n\nWe  maintain  bank  credit  facilities  to  support  our  ongoing commercial  paper  program.  The  current  facility  is  an  $8.0 billion  facility  split  between  a  $3.2  billion  five-year  facility and a $4.8 billion 364-day facility, which expire in November 2026 and November 2022, respectively. Both facilities can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in the terms of the credit agreement. These facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain undrawn. These credit facilities  do  not  have  cross-default or ratings triggers, nor do they have material adverse events clauses, except at the time of  signing.  In  addition  to  these  credit  facilities,  we  have  an automatically  effective  registration  statement  on  Form  S-3 filed with the SEC that is available for registered offerings of short-  or  long-term  debt  securities.  For  additional  details  on debt, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nWe do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements,  including  variable  interest  entities,  which  we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.",

Foreign exchange impacts negatively affected net earnings by approximately $274 million.\n- Net earnings attributable to Procter &amp; Gamble were $14.7 billion, an increase of $0.4 billion or 3% versus the prior year primarily due to the increase in net earnings.\n- Diluted  net  earnings  per  share  (EPS)  increased  6%  to $5.81 due to the increase in net earnings, a reduction in shares outstanding and due to the prior year loss on early debt extinguishment. Net earnings per share increased 3% versus the prior year core net earnings per share due to the increase in net earnings and a reduction in shares outstanding.\n- Cash flow from operating activities was $16.7 billion.\n-    Adjusted free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less  capital  expenditures  and  certain  other  impacts, was $13.8 billion.\n-    Adjusted free cash flow productivity, which is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings, was 93%.\n\n## ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES\n\nWe discuss expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives, in annual and quarterly reports, press releases and\n\nGlobal Economic  Conditions. Our  products are sold in numerous  countries  across  North  America,  Europe,  Latin America,  Asia  and  Africa,  with  more  than  half  our  sales generated outside the United States. As such, we are exposed to  and  impacted  by  global  macroeconomic  factors,  U.S.  and foreign government policies and foreign exchange fluctuations. Global economic conditions continue to be volatile  due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  resulting  in  market size contractions in certain countries due to economic slowdowns and government restrictions on movement. Other macroeconomic factors also remain dynamic, and any causes of  market size contraction, such as greater political unrest or instability  in  the  Middle  East,  Central  and  Eastern  Europe (including  the  ongoing  Russia-Ukraine  War),  certain  Latin American  markets,  the  Hong  Kong  market  in  Greater  China and the Korean peninsula could reduce our sales or erode our operating  margin  and  consequently  reduce  our  net  earnings and cash flows.\n\nChanges  in  Costs. Our  costs  are  subject  to  fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, transportation costs, other broader inflationary impacts and our own  productivity  efforts.  We  have  significant  exposures  to certain commodities, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp. Volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs. Disruptions in our manufacturing, supply and  distribution  operations,  including  energy  shortages,  port congestions, labor constraints and freight container and truck shortages  have  impacted  our  costs  and  could  do  so  in  the future.  If  we  are  unable  to  manage  these  impacts  through pricing  actions,  cost  savings  projects  and  sourcing  decisions, as well as through",

      "question": "What is the combined focus on health and wellness innovation and merchandising between PepsiCo and Walmart, and how do their respective strategies differ in addressing this shared product category?",
      "answer": "PepsiCo focuses on health and wellness through product innovation, including reducing added sugars, sodium, and saturated fats, while offering more products with functional ingredients like legumes, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, dairy, protein (including plant-based), fiber, micronutrients, and hydration. This is part of their broader research and development strategy to reformulate existing products and develop new ones. Walmart, on the other hand, addresses health and wellness through merchandising, offering a dedicated category that includes pharmacy, over-the-counter drugs, other medical products, and clinical services such as optical care. While PepsiCo emphasizes product development and reformulation for health, Walmart focuses on retailing health-related products and services directly to consumers.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - PepsiCo invests in innovation to improve product health profiles, including reducing added sugars, sodium, and saturated fats, and increasing functional ingredients like plant-based proteins and fiber.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Walmart includes 'health and wellness' as a distinct merchandise category, encompassing pharmacy, over-the-counter drugs, medical products, and clinical services such as optical care.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies engage with health and wellness, but PepsiCo focuses on product reformulation and innovation, while Walmart focuses on retailing health-related products and services."

Meanwhile, Sam's Club explicitly categorizes 'health and wellness' as one of its key merchandise segments, offering pharmacy, optical, hearing services, and over-the-counter drugs.

      "answer": "The international expansion of hard discounters creates a dual impact on both COST and PEP. For PEP, as stated in their 2024 10-K, sales to Walmart and its affiliates accounted for approximately 14% of their consolidated net revenue, indicating a significant dependency. As hard discounters expand globally, they could further consolidate their market power, increasing PEP's vulnerability to revenue concentration risk should Walmart or other hard discounters gain more control over pricing or shelf space. For COST, the 2024 filing notes that they face strong competition from hard discounters and that their ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, especially through technology and pricing, is critical to maintaining market share. In foreign markets where COST operates, the growth of hard discounters could erode COST\u2019s competitive position if they are unable to maintain their pricing strategies or innovate their digital platforms in a timely manner. Therefore, the expansion of hard discounters globally not only intensifies COST\u2019s competitive risk but also indirectly heightens PEP\u2019s concentration risk by strengthening the position of dominant retail players.",

        "Step 1: Extract from COST's 2024 10-K - 'We face strong competition from... hard discounters' and the risk of being unable to respond effectively to competitive pressures, particularly in foreign markets.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - The international growth of hard discounters increases competitive pressure on COST, especially in foreign markets where maintaining technological and pricing advantages is crucial. At the same time, this expansion could consolidate the power of large retailers like Walmart, further entrenching PEP's dependency on a single customer, thereby increasing PEP's revenue concentration risk."

      "answer": "Costco strategically emphasizes private-label brands such as Kirkland Signature, which are stated to 'generally earn higher margins' due to lower pricing to consumers and differentiation from national brands. This private-label focus allows retailers like Costco to capture more margin while offering value to consumers. Meanwhile, PepsiCo faces competitive pressure in securing 'shelf space and preferable shelf placement' at retailers, including Kroger, where shelf visibility is critical for driving sales of branded products. As retailers like Costco prioritize private-label offerings that compete directly with branded items like PepsiCo\u2019s, this dynamic reduces the available premium shelf space for branded manufacturers. Since PepsiCo relies on this visibility to maintain sales volume and pricing power, the expansion of private-label products in key retail channels likely pressures PepsiCo\u2019s gross margins by forcing potential price concessions or increased marketing spend to counter reduced shelf presence.",

The Company also enters into v ariable-priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for its gas stations,  on  an  index  basis.

      "question": "What was the impact of LIFO inventory accounting on merchandise costs for Costco in fiscal year 2023, and how does this compare to the percentage of inventories that Altria valued using the LIFO method during calendar year 2023?",
      "answer": "Costco recorded a $438 million charge to merchandise costs in fiscal year 2023 due to inflation under the LIFO inventory accounting method. During the same calendar year, Altria used the LIFO method to value approximately 76% of its inventories. These figures reflect different applications of LIFO accounting, with Costco explicitly quantifying its LIFO impact while Altria only disclosed the percentage of inventories under LIFO without specific financial effects.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From COST's 10-K, identify the explicit LIFO charge recorded in 2023 - '$438 charge was recorded to merchandise costs to increase the cumulative LIFO valuation on merchandise inventories at August 28, 2022.'",
        "Step 2: From MO's 10-K, extract the percentage of inventories valued using the LIFO method - 'We determined the cost of approximately 76% and 79% of our inventories at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, using the LIFO method.'",
        "Step 3: Compare the specific LIFO disclosures - COST quantifies its LIFO impact ($438 million charge), while MO only provides the proportion of inventories under LIFO (76%) without financial impact figures.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize the comparison - while both companies use LIFO for a portion of inventories, only COST explicitly reports the financial impact of LIFO accounting in 2023, highlighting differences in disclosure practices."

In contrast, Altria does not offer defined benefit pension plans to employees hired on or after a specific date, instead providing them with a defined contribution plan with enhanced benefits. This indicates that while both companies utilize defined contribution plans, Costco directly reports substantial expenses tied to these plans, whereas Altria uses the defined contribution structure as a replacement for pension ineligibility for newer hires.",

Meanwhile, PepsiCo extends credit terms typically requiring payment within 30 days domestically and up to 90 days internationally, and estimates credit losses based on historical data and forward-looking economic projections, including the impact of the global economic uncertainty from the pandemic. The combination of Altria's vulnerability to credit market disruptions and PepsiCo's structured but risk-managed credit terms highlights how both companies must navigate credit-related challenges to maintain financial stability and manage cash flow effectively under economic uncertainty.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Altria may be unable to attract and retain the best talent due to the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage, tobacco control actions and other factors, which could adversely affect Altria's ability to achieve its Vision.\n\nOur ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best talent may be impaired by the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage and tobacco regulation and control actions. The tobacco industry competes for talent with the consumer products industry and other companies that may enjoy greater societal acceptance and fewer longer-term challenges. As a result, we may be unable to attract and retain the best talent. In addition, our ability to retain the best talent may be adversely affected by current labor market dynamics in which the number of U.S. workers leaving their jobs increased significantly. Failure to attract and retain the best talent could adversely affect Altria's ability to achieve its Vision.\n\n## Altria may be required to write down intangible assets, including goodwill, due to impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.\n\nWe periodically calculate the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets to test for impairment. This calculation may be affected by several factors, including general economic conditions (such as continued uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic), regulatory developments, changes in category growth rates as a result of changing adult tobacco consumer preferences, success of planned new product expansions, competitive activity and income and excise taxes. Certain events also can trigger an immediate review of intangible assets. If an impairment is determined to exist in either situation, we will incur impairment losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. For further discussion, see Discussion and Analysis Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Item 7.\n\n## Risks Related to the Capital Markets and Financing\n\n## Acquisitions or other events may adversely affect Altria's credit rating, and Altria may not achieve its anticipated strategic or financial objectives of a transaction.\n\nFrom time to time, Altria considers acquisitions, investments or dispositions and may engage in confidential negotiations that are not publicly announced unless and until those negotiations result in a definitive agreement. Although we seek to maintain or improve our credit ratings over time, it is possible that completing a given acquisition, investment, disposition or the occurrence of other events could negatively impact our investment grade credit ratings or the outlook for those ratings as occurred following our investment in JUUL. Any such change in ratings or outlook may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and also may increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate. Furthermore, acquisition opportunities are limited, and acquisitions present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration, strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings. There can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or an investment. Additionally, there can be no assurance that we will be able to dispose of our businesses or investments on favorable terms, which may result in a loss in our consolidated statements of earnings (losses).\n\n## Disruption and uncertainty in the credit and capital markets could adversely affect Altria's access to these markets, earnings and dividend rate.\n\nAccess to the credit and capital markets is important for us to satisfy our liquidity and financing needs. For example, we typically access the commercial paper market early in the second quarter to help fund payments under the Master Settlement Agreement (the 'MSA') tax obligations and shareholder dividends. Disruption and uncertainty in these markets and any resulting adverse impact on credit availability, pricing, credit terms or credit rating may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and may also increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate.\n\n## Altria may be unable to attract investors due to the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage.\n\nThere is increasing investor focus on environmental, social and governance ('ESG') matters. Organizations that provide ESG information to investors have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Decreasing social acceptance of tobacco products or unfavorable ESG ratings may lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward Altria, which could result in shareholders choosing to divest their ownership in Altria stock or potential investors choosing not to invest in Altria stock and could have a negative impact on the market performance of Altria stock.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Investments\n\n## A challenge to our investment in JUUL, if successful, could result in a broad range of resolutions, including divestiture of the investment or rescission of the transaction.\n\nA challenge to our investment in JUUL, if successful, could result in a broad range of resolutions such as divestiture of the investment or rescission of the transaction. In April 2020, the FTC issued an administrative complaint against Altria and JUUL alleging that Altria's 35% investment in JUUL and the associated agreements constitute an unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act and Section 5 of the FTC Act, and substantially lessened competition in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act. The FTC seeks a broad range of remedies, including divestiture of Altria's investment in JUUL, rescission of the transaction and prohibition against any officer or director of either Altria or JUUL serving on the other's board of directors or attending meetings.

These assets are reported in the country where they are primarily used.\n\n- (b) The increase in net revenue reflects our acquisition of Be &amp; Cheery. See Note 13 for further information.\n- (c) The increase in net revenue reflects our acquisition of Pioneer Foods. See Note 13 for further information.\n\n## Note 2 - Our Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nWe recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales of beverage and convenient food products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is also when control is transferred. Merchandising activities are performed after a customer obtains control of the product, are accounted for as fulfillment of our performance obligation to ship or deliver product to our customers and are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Merchandising  activities  are  immaterial  in  the  context  of  our  contracts.  In  addition,  we  exclude  from  net revenue all sales, use, value-added and certain excise taxes assessed by government authorities on revenue producing transactions.\n\nThe transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that do not allow for  a  right  of  return.  However,  our  policy  for  DSD,  including  certain  chilled  products,  is  to  remove  and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality  and  freshness  they  expect.  Similarly,  our  policy  for  certain  warehouse-distributed  products  is  to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.\n\nOur products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally, and may allow discounts for early payment.\n\nWe estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and  collectibility,  write-off  history,  the  aging  of  accounts  receivable,  our  analysis  of  customer  data,  and forward-looking information (including the expected impact of the global economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic), leveraging estimates of creditworthiness and projections of default and recovery rates for certain of our customers.\n\nWe are exposed to concentration of credit risk from our major customers, including Walmart. We have not experienced credit issues with these customers. In 2021, sales to Walmart and its affiliates (including Sam's) represented  approximately  13%  of  our  consolidated  net  revenue,  including  concentrate  sales  to  our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart.\n\n## Total Marketplace Spending\n\nWe  offer  sales  incentives  and  discounts  through  various  programs  to  customers  and  consumers.  Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives  and  discounts  are  primarily  accounted  for  as  a  reduction  of  revenue  and  include  payments  to customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution  of  new  products,  payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. Sales incentives  and  discounts  also  include  support  provided  to  our  independent  bottlers  through  funding  of advertising and other marketing activities.\n\nA  number  of  our  sales  incentives,  such  as  bottler  funding  to  independent  bottlers  and  customer  volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for  the  expected  payout,  which  may  occur  after  year  end  once  reconciled  and  settled.  These  accruals  are based  on  contract  terms  and  our  historical  experience  with  similar  programs  and  require  management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance",

Such accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change. Other than those amounts, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the cost of any environmental remediation and compliance efforts that subsidiaries of Altria may undertake in the future. In the opinion of management, however, compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including the payment of any remediation costs or damages and the making of related expenditures, has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on Altria's consolidated results of operations, capital expenditures, financial position or cash flows.\n\n## Guarantees and Other Similar Matters\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, certain subsidiaries of Altria have agreed to indemnify a limited number of third parties in the event of future litigation. At December 31, 2021, Altria and certain of its subsidiaries (i) had $48 million of unused letters of credit obtained in the ordinary course of business and (ii) were contingently liable for guarantees related to their own performance, including $19 million for surety bonds recorded on its consolidated balance sheet. In addition, from time to time, subsidiaries of Altria issue lines of credit to affiliated entities. These items have not had, and are not expected to have, a significant impact on Altria's liquidity.\n\nUnder the terms of a distribution agreement between Altria and PMI (the 'Distribution Agreement'), entered into as a result of Altria's 2008 spin-off of its former subsidiary PMI, liabilities concerning tobacco products will be allocated based in substantial part on the manufacturer. PMI will indemnify Altria and PM USA for liabilities related to tobacco products manufactured by PMI or contract manufactured for PMI by PM USA, and PM USA will indemnify PMI for liabilities related to tobacco products manufactured by PM USA, excluding tobacco products contract manufactured for PMI. Altria does not have a related liability recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2021 as the fair value of this indemnification is insignificant. PMI has agreed not to seek indemnification with respect to the IQOS patent litigation discussed above under IQOS Litigation, excluding the patent infringement case filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.\n\nPM USA has issued guarantees relating to Altria's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its $3.0 billion Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program.

      "answer": "Altria is restricted under the State Settlement Agreements from using outdoor and transit brand advertising, product placement payments, and free sampling (except in adult-only facilities). It also faces limitations on brand name sponsorships, prohibitions on targeting youth, and restrictions involving cartoon characters. These constraints directly shape Altria\u2019s advertising strategies by limiting traditional and youth-oriented marketing channels. In contrast, PepsiCo faces regulatory risks related to product labeling and marketing limitations tied to ingredients, such as requirements to display health warnings or restrict marketing to certain age groups. For example, some jurisdictions are considering or have imposed restrictions on marketing products containing caloric sweeteners to specific demographics or requiring warning labels under laws like California\u2019s Proposition 65.

These settlements require participating manufacturers to make substantial annual payments, which are adjusted for several factors, including inflation, operating income, market share and industry volume. Increases in inflation can increase our financial liability under the State Settlement Agreements. The State Settlement Agreements' inflation calculations require us to apply the higher of 3% or the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers ('CPI-U') percentage rate as published in January of each year. As of December 2021, the inflation calculation was approximately 7% based on the latest CPI-U data; however, the increase in the annual payments did not have a material impact on Altria's financial position. Altria believes that inflation will continue at increased levels in 2022, but does not expect the corresponding increase in annual payments to result in a material financial impact. However, we will continue to monitor conditions related to the impact of increased inflation on the macroeconomic environment.\n\nFor a discussion of the impact of the State Settlement Agreements on Altria, see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation below and Note 18. The State Settlement Agreements also place numerous requirements and restrictions on participating manufacturers' business operations, including prohibitions and restrictions on the advertising and marketing of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products. Among these are prohibitions of outdoor and transit brand advertising, payments for product placement and free sampling (except in adult-only facilities). The State Settlement Agreements also place restrictions on the use of brand name sponsorships and brand name non-tobacco products and prohibitions on targeting youth and the use of cartoon characters. In addition, the State Settlement Agreements require companies to affirm corporate principles directed at reducing underage use of cigarettes; impose requirements regarding lobbying activities; limit the industry's ability to challenge certain tobacco control and underage use laws; and provide for the dissolution of certain tobacco-related organizations and place restrictions on the establishment of any replacement organizations.\n\nIn November 1998, USSTC entered into the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (the 'STMSA') with the attorneys general of various states and United States territories to resolve the remaining health care cost reimbursement cases initiated against USSTC. The STMSA required USSTC to adopt various marketing and advertising restrictions. USSTC is the only smokeless tobacco manufacturer to sign the STMSA.\n\n## Other International, Federal, State and Local Regulation and Governmental and Private Activity\n\n- International, Federal, State and Local Regulation: Various states and localities have enacted or proposed legislation that imposes restrictions on tobacco products (including cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, cigars, e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouches), such as legislation that (i) prohibits the sale of all tobacco products or certain tobacco categories, such as e-vapor, (ii) prohibits the sale of tobacco products with characterizing flavors, such as menthol cigarettes and flavored e-vapor products, (iii) requires the disclosure of health information separate from or in addition to federally mandated health warnings and (iv) restricts commercial speech or imposes additional restrictions on the marketing or sale of tobacco products. The legislation varies in terms of the type of tobacco products, the conditions under which such products are or would be restricted or prohibited, and exceptions to the restrictions or prohibitions. For example, a number of proposals involving characterizing flavors would prohibit smokeless tobacco products with characterizing flavors without providing an exception for mint- or wintergreen-flavored products. As of February 22, 2022, multiple states and localities are considering legislation to ban flavors in one or more tobacco products, and six states (California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Utah, New York and Illinois) and the District of Columbia have passed such legislation. Some of these states, such as New York, Utah and Illinois, exempt certain products that have received FDA market authorization through the PMTA pathway.\n\nThe legislation in California bans the sale of most tobacco products with characterizing flavors, including menthol, mint and wintergreen. Following enactment of the flavor ban in August 2020, several registered California voters filed a referendum against the legislation. In January 2021 the requisite number of registered California voters signed a petition to place the question of whether the legislation should be affirmed or overturned on the next statewide general election ballot, which will likely take place in November 2022, unless a special statewide election is called earlier. As a result, the implementation of the legislation is delayed until after a vote on the referendum occurs.\n\nMassachusetts passed legislation capping the amount of nicotine in e-vapor products. Similar legislation is pending in one other state.\n\nRestrictions on e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products also have been instituted or proposed internationally.\n\nAltria's tobacco operating companies have challenged and will continue to challenge certain federal, state and local legislation and other governmental action, including through litigation. It is possible, however, that legislation, regulation or other governmental action could be enacted or implemented that could have a material adverse impact on the business and volume of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees, and the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL. Such action also could negatively impact adult smokers' transition to these products, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve our Vision.",

NJOY ACE is the principal e-vapor product of NJOY. NJOY's commercialized product portfolio of tobacco and menthol e-vapor products is fully covered by marketing granted orders ('MGO') from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ('FDA').\n- Other tobacco products: In connection with the joint venture agreement with JTIUH, Horizon will market and commercialize HTS products, which are defined in the joint venture agreement as products that include both (i) a tobacco heating device intended to heat the consumable without combusting and (ii) a consumable that meets the definition of a cigarette under the U.S. Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act. Horizon is responsible for the U.S. commercialization of current and future HTS products owned by either party and, upon authorization by the FDA of a pre-market tobacco application ('PMTA'), will become the exclusive entity through which the parties market and commercialize HTS products in the United States. Upon PMTA authorization of Ploom HTS products, JTIUH will supply Ploom HTS devices and PM USA will manufacture Marlboro HTS consumables for U.S. commercialization. As of February 26, 2025, there are no products in the U.S. marketplace from the joint venture.\n\nOn April 30, 2024, we assigned the exclusive U.S. commercialization rights to the IQOS Tobacco Heating System (' IQOS System') to Philip Morris International Inc. ('PMI') pursuant to the terms of a purchase agreement entered into with PMI in October 2022. For further discussion of the agreement with PMI see Note 6. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 ('Note 6').\n\n- Distribution, Competition and Raw Materials: Our tobacco subsidiaries sell their tobacco products principally to wholesalers (including distributors) and large retail organizations, including chain stores.\n\nThe market for tobacco products is highly competitive, characterized by brand recognition and loyalty, with product quality, taste, price, product innovation, marketing, packaging and distribution constituting the significant methods of competition. Promotional activities include, in certain instances and where permitted by law, allowances, the distribution of incentive items, price promotions, product promotions, coupons and other discounts.\n\nIn the United States, under a contract growing program, PM USA purchases the majority of its burley and flue-cured leaf tobaccos directly from domestic tobacco growers. Under the terms of this program, PM USA agrees to purchase the amount of tobacco specified in the grower contracts that meets PM USA's grade and quality standards. PM USA also purchases a portion of its tobacco requirements through leaf merchants.\n\nUSSTC purchases dark fire-cured, dark air-cured and burley leaf tobaccos from domestic tobacco growers under a contract growing program. Under the terms of this program, USSTC agrees to purchase the amount of tobacco specified in the grower contracts that meets USSTC's grade and quality standards.\n\nMiddleton purchases burley, dark air-cured and flue-cured leaf tobaccos through leaf merchants. Middleton does not have a contract growing program.\n\nHelix, through an affiliate, and NJOY purchase tobacco-derived nicotine materials from suppliers and believe their suppliers can satisfy current and anticipated future production requirements.\n\nOur tobacco subsidiaries believe there is an adequate supply of tobacco in the world markets to satisfy their current and anticipated production requirements.\n\n## Other Matters\n\n- Customers: For a discussion of our largest customers, including their percentages of our consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, see Note 17.\n- Executive Officers of Altria: The disclosure regarding executive officers is included in Item 10.

These systems are utilized to process a v ery high v olume of transactions, conduct payment transactions, track and v alue our inv entory and produce reports critical for making business decisions. Failure or disruption of these systems could hav e an adverse impact on our ability to buy products and serv ices from our suppliers, produce goods in our manufacturing plants, mov e the products in an efficient manner to our warehouses and sell products to our members. Giv en the high v olume of transactions we process, it is important that we build strong digital resiliency to prev ent disruption from ev ents such as power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, v iruses, internal or external security  breaches  and  other  cybersecurity  incidents,  errors  by  employees,  extreme  weather,  and  catastrophic  ev ents. Any  debilitating  failure  of  our critical IT  systems, data centers and backup systems would require significant inv estments in resources to restore IT serv ices and may cause serious impairment in our business operations including loss of business serv ices, increased cost of mov ing merchandise and failure to prov ide serv ice to our members. We are currently making substantial inv estments in technology and IT transformation projects, including maintaining and enhancing our digital resiliency, and failure or delay in these projects could be costly and harmful to our business. Failure to deliv er IT  transformation efforts efficiently and effectiv ely  could  result  in  the  loss  of  our  competitiv e  position  and  adv ersely  impact  our  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.  Insufficient  IT capacity could also impact our capacity for timely, complete and accurate financial and non-financial reporting required by law.\n\nWe are required to maintain the privacy and security of personal and business information amidst multiplying threat landscapes and in compliance with increasing privacy and data protection regulations globally. Failure to do so could damage our business, including our reputation with members, suppliers and employees, cause us to incur substantial additional costs, and become subject to litigation and regulatory action.\n\nIncreased security threats and more sophisticated cyber misconduct pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and serv ices. We rely upon IT systems  and  networks,  some  of  which  are  managed  by  or  belong  to  third  parties,  including  suppliers,  partners,  v endors,  and  serv ice  prov iders. Additionally, we collect, store and process sensitiv e information relating to our business, members, employees, and other third parties. Operating these IT systems and networks, and processing and maintaining this data, in a secure manner, is critical to our business operations and strategy. Remote work has also expanded the possible attack surfaces. Attempts to gain unauthorized access to systems, networks and data, both ours and third parties with whom we work, are increasing in frequency and sophistication, and in some cases, these attempts are successful. Cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crimes and adv anced persistent threats. Phishing attacks hav e emerged as particularly prominent, including as v ectors for ransomware attacks, which hav e increased in breadth and frequency. While we train our employees as part of our security efforts, that training cannot be completely effectiv e. T hese threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, integrity, and av ailability of our data. Our IT  systems and networks, or those managed by third parties such as cloud prov iders or suppliers that otherwise host or hav e access to confidential information, periodically hav e v ulnerabilities, which may go unnoticed for a period of time. Our logging capabilities, or the logging capabilities of third parties, are also not always complete or sufficiently detailed, affecting our ability to fully inv estigate and understand the scope of security ev ents. While our cybersecurity and compliance efforts seek to mitigate such risks, there can be no guarantee that the actions and controls we and our third-party serv ice prov iders hav e implemented and are implementing, will be sufficient to protect our systems, information or other property.\n\nThe  potential  impacts  of  a  cybersecurity  attack  include  reputational  damage,  litigation,  gov ernment  enforcement  actions,  penalties,  disruption  to systems  and  operations,  unauthorized  release  of  confidential  or  otherwise  protected  information,  corruption  of  data,  diminution  in  the  v alue  of  our inv estment  in  IT   systems  and  increased  cybersecurity  protection  and  remediation  costs.  T his  could  adv ersely  affect  our  competitiv eness,  results  of operations and financial condition and, critically in light of our business model, loss of member confidence. Further, the insurance cov erage we maintain and indemnification arrangements with third parties may be inadequate to cov er claims, costs, and liabilities relating to",

Some of these information  systems  and  networks  are  developed,  supplied,  or  managed  by  third-party  service  providers  that  may  make  us  vulnerable  to  'supply  chain'  style cyberattacks. Additionally, some information technology systems may be supported by artificial intelligence capabilities that may not function as intended, posing cybersecurity and data protection risks. The failure or disruption of our information technology networks and systems, or those managed by third-party service providers or owned by our business partners and used in furtherance of PMI's business, due to cybersecurity attacks; unauthorized attempts to corrupt or extract data; security vulnerabilities; misconfigurations; human error; or failure or inability by us, third-parties, or our business partners to adhere to cybersecurity industry best  practices,  could  place  us  at  a  competitive  disadvantage,  cause  reputational  damage,  impact  our  operations,  result  in  data  breaches,  significant  business disruption, litigation, regulatory action including significant fines or penalties, financial impact, loss of revenue or assets including our intellectual property, personal, confidential, or sensitive data.\n\nCyberattacks,  security  incidents  and  vulnerabilities  impacting  PMI,  newly  acquired  companies,  our  business  partners,  or  our  third-party  providers,  continue  to dynamically evolve in sophistication and volume, making it difficult for us to predict probability, frequency, and impact severity of security incidents.  Further, it may be inherently difficult to detect vulnerabilities during due diligence, for long periods of time, or soon enough to mitigate ex ploitation. There can be no assurance that such security incidents or vulnerabilities will not have a material adverse effect on us in the future. While PMI works to mitigate these risks by implementing a cybersecurity risk program and a third-party cybersecurity risk management program, there can be no assurance that these programs are comprehensive or accurately identify and sufficiently mitigate all cybersecurity risks.\n\nWe continue to make investments in administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to maintain information security protections in line with industry standards and best practices. We evaluate the adequacy of preventative actions to reduce security incidents on an ongoing basis.\n\nCyberattacks, security incidents and vulnerabilities have impacted, and we expect will continue to impact, PMI, our business partners, and our third-party providers. Cyberattacks continue to dynamically evolve in sophistication and volume, making it difficult for us to predict probability, frequency, and impact severity of security incidents on the Company. We also have, and continue to face, immaterial third-party information security breaches. While these types of incidents have occurred frequently within the last three years, none have been material to our business, financial condition, or results.\n\nOur safeguards may not, however, be effective in mitigating the impact of service disruptions or other failures of these information technology networks and systems. Failure to timely respond and mitigate security incidents, could result in wide-ranging business interruptions. Such security incidents could place us at a competitive disadvantage; result in financial impacts, a loss of revenue, assets, including our intellectual property, personal or other sensitive data; result in litigation and regulatory action including significant fines or penalties; impact our operations; cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands; and result in significant remediation and other costs. See Item 1C. Cybersecurity for a description of our cybersecurity risk management and strategy and governance.\n\n## Our  or  our  business  partners'  failure  or  inability  to  adhere  to  priv acy ,  data,  artificial  intelligence  and  information  security  law s  could  result  in  business disruption, loss of reputation and consumer trust, litigation, regulatory action including significant fines or penalties, financial impact, and loss of revenue, assets or personal, confidential, or sensitiv e data.\n\nAn actual or alleged failure to comply with complex and changing privacy, data, artificial intelligence and information security laws and regulations under the EU General Data Protection Regulation, various U.S. state and federal laws, and other similar privacy and information security laws across the jurisdictions in which PMI operates, such as the failure to protect personal data; implement appropriate technological and reasonable security measures; implement and maintain appropriate safeguards  for  personal  data  being  transferred  internationally;  respect  the  privacy  rights  of  data  subjects;  provide  sufficient  detailed  notices  of  personal  data processing; retrieve consent and provide opt-outs; meet stringent timeframe requirements for incident reporting to regulatory authorities; comply with artificial intelligence regulations, and others, could have a material adverse effect on us, subject us to substantial fines and/or legal challenges, and/or harm our business, reputation, financial condition, or operating results. Such laws and regulations across the jurisdictions in which PMI operates may vary, resulting in inconsistent or conflicting legal obligations. Although we maintain a cyber",

      "answer": "CL allocates 30% of its U.S. pension plan fixed income portfolio to U.S. treasury or agency securities, indicating a conservative risk management approach within its broader pension strategy, which also includes investments in corporate bonds and other government bonds. In contrast, COST holds $633 million in government and agency securities directly on its balance sheet, suggesting a more direct and substantial capital allocation to these lower-risk assets. This difference implies that while both companies invest in agency securities, CL uses them as part of a diversified pension strategy, whereas COST appears to hold them as a core component of its own financial positioning, potentially for liquidity or balance sheet stability.",

Similarly, Costco establishes a valuation allowance when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized.

      "answer": "Costco could face adverse effects on merchandise inventories, sales, and profit margins if suppliers fail to meet its high standards for quality and compliance, as stated in its 10-K filing. This could result in out-of-stock positions, loss of sales, and potential reputational harm. Walmart, on the other hand, could incur liability for injuries caused by products it sells, experience a material impact on brand reputation, and face financial losses due to recalls or regulatory actions tied to product safety failures from suppliers. The consequences differ in that Costco emphasizes inventory availability and profit margin pressures, while Walmart highlights legal liability and brand damage risks.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from COST 10-K - 'Suppliers may be unable to timely supply us with quality merchandise at competitive prices or may fail to adhere to our high standards, resulting in adverse effects on our business, merchandise inventories, sales, and profit margins.'",
        "Step 2: Extract from WMT 10-K - 'If the quality or safety of products we sell in stores or online fails to meet our customers' expectations or regulatory standards, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries caused by a product we sell or otherwise experience a material impact to our brand, reputation and financial performance.'",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies identify supplier regulatory compliance as a critical risk, but they highlight different financial and operational consequences based on their business models and customer expectations."

Additionally, trade-related actions in v arious countries, particularly China and the United States, hav e affected the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. T he impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to potential cost increases. Higher tariffs could adv ersely impact our results.\n\nPrices of certain commodities, including gasoline and consumable goods used in manufacturing and our warehouse retail operations, are historically volatile  and  are  subject  to  fluctuations  arising  from  changes  in  domestic  and  international  supply  and  demand,  inflationary  pressures,  labor  costs, competition, market speculation, gov ernment regulations, taxes and periodic delays in deliv ery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices and our ability and desire to pass them through to our members may affect our sales and profit margins. These factors could also increase our merchandise costs and selling, general and administrativ e expenses, and otherwise adv ersely affect our operations and financial results. General economic conditions can also be affected by ev ents like the outbreak of hostilities or acts of terrorism.\n\nInflationary factors such as increases in merchandise costs may adv ersely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to adjust prices to sufficiently offset the effect of cost increases without negativ ely impacting consumer demand.\n\nSuppliers may be unable to timely supply us with quality merchandise at competitive prices or may fail to adhere to our high standards, resulting in adverse effects on our business, merchandise inventories, sales, and profit margins.\n\nWe depend heavily on our ability to purchase quality merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitiv e prices. As the quantities we require continue to grow, we hav e no assurances of continued supply, appropriate pricing or access to new products, and any supplier has the ability to change the terms upon which they sell to us or discontinue selling to us. Member demands may lead to out-of-stock positions causing a loss of sales and profits.\n\nWe buy from numerous domestic and foreign suppliers and importers. Our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key suppliers could negativ ely affect us. We may not be able to dev elop relationships with new suppliers, and products from alternativ e sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality or more expensiv e.  Because of our efforts to adhere to high-quality standards for which av ailable supply may be limited, particularly  for  certain  food  items,  the  large  v olumes  we  demand  may  not  be  consistently  av ailable.  Our  efforts  to  secure  supply  could  lead  to commitments that prove to be unsuccessful in the short and long-term.\n\nOur suppliers (and those they depend upon for materials and serv ices) are subject to risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activ ities, human and animal rights v iolations, financial liquidity, climate change, natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, env ironmental degradation, public health emergencies, supply constraints and general economic and political conditions and other risks similar to those we face that could limit their ability to timely prov ide us with acceptable merchandise. One or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control, packaging, legal, regulatory, labor, human rights, env ironmental or animal welfare standards.  These deficiencies may delay or preclude deliv ery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members. This",

Certain impacts of physical risk may include: temperature changes that increase the heating and cooling costs at stores, clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers; ex treme weather patterns that affect the production or sourcing of certain commodities; flooding and extreme storms that damage or destroy our buildings and inventory; disruption of electrical grids or utilities required to operate our stores, clubs and information systems; and heat and extreme weather events that cause long-term disruption or threats to the habitability of the communities in which we operate. Relative to transition risk, certain impacts may include: changes in energy and commodity prices driven by climate-related weather events; prolonged climate-related events affecting macroeconomic conditions with related effects on consumer spending and confidence; stakeholder perception of our engagement in climate-related policies; and new regulatory requirements resulting in higher compliance risk and operational costs.\n\nWe bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to, or destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers; theft, loss or spoilage of inventory; and business interruption caused by such events. These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Moreover, our operations in the U.S. comprise a significant portion of our financial and operational performance. Therefore, any of the above matters that uniquely impact or are specifically concentrated in the U.S. could materially adversely affect our financial and operational performance.\n\n## Risks associated with our suppliers could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nThe products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. We expect our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety, anti-corruption and environmental laws, and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner and in the large volumes we may demand, are significant challenges, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the U.S.\n\nPolitical and economic instability, as well as other impactful events and circumstances (such as we previously experienced (and could experience again) with the pandemic recovery related challenges, including supply chain disruption and production, labor shortages and increases in labor costs) in the countries in which our suppliers and their manufacturers are located or regions goods are transported from or through, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers not having the financial ability or capacity to fulfill their indemnification obligations to us if called upon, thereby ex posing us to the full cost of risks and claims, suppliers' failure to meet our terms and conditions or our supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, ex treme weather events impacting the growing, manufacturing, mining and harvesting of commodities and products, merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption or delay in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs and other facilities, including as a result of ex treme weather or labor slowdowns and/or strikes at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the markets in which we operate, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control.\n\nIn addition, U.S. and international trade policies, tariffs, trade barriers and other restrictions on the ex portation and importation of goods, trade sanctions imposed between certain countries and entities, the limitation on the ex portation or importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers, our access to products and our access to service providers (such as transportation and logistics providers) could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.\n\nIf the quality or safety of products w e sell in stores or online fails to meet our customers' expectations or regulatory standards, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries caused by a product we sell or otherwise experience a material impact to our brand, reputation and financial performance.\n\nOur customers count on us to provide them with quality products at an affordable price. Occasionally, the quality of products that we source from our suppliers fails to meet customer expectations. In many cases, these products are subject to regulatory action or recall. For general merchandise, this could be because the product fails to meet safety standards. For food products, it could be because the product is a source of foodborne illness. For health and wellness products, it could be because the product does not produce the expected result for the customer or harms the customer. Any of these factors could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to choose to buy products from a different retailer, even if the quality issue is outside of our control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish. When a",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Overview\n\nThis discussion, which presents our results for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025 (\"fiscal 2025\"), January 31, 2024 (\"fiscal 2024\") and January 31, 2023 (\"fiscal 2023\"), should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole.\n\nThroughout this Item 7, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures.  Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker.\n\nManagement also measures the results of comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, for a particular period from the corresponding prior year period. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated digitally, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs as well as certain other business offerings that are part of our ecosystem, such as our advertising net sales. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than 5%. Sales related to divested businesses are excluded from comparable sales, and sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as \"same-store\" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nIn discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the effect of changes in currency ex change rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency ex change rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency ex change rates have impacted and may continue to impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment.\n\nWe have taken certain strategic actions across our segments, including an increased emphasis on investments in automation and supply chain as well as diversifying our earnings streams through category and business mix. In December 2024, the Walmart U.S. segment completed the acquisition of VIZIO Holding Corp. for net cash consideration of $1.9 billion. Additionally, we have taken actions in the Walmart International segment to reshape our portfolio including the following highlights over the last three years:\n\n- In November 2022, we completed the buyout of the noncontrolling interest shareholders of our Massmart subsidiary (Refer to Note 3) and in December 2022, we exited operations in certain countries in Africa.\n- In December 2022, we increased our ownership in PhonePe as part of the separation from our majority-owned Flipkart subsidiary. Refer to Note 3.\n- In August 2024, we sold our equity investment in JD.com for net proceeds of $3.6 billion. Refer to Note 8.\n\nWe operate in a highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce, health and wellness, financial services, advertising and data service businesses. Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence. We compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality associates. We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather and other risks related to climate change, global health epidemics and pandemics, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, disruptions in supply chain, inventory management, cost and availability of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, inflation, deflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic",

      "question": "How do Target and Walmart's inventory accounting methods affect their LIFO provisions for fiscal year 2023?",
      "answer": "Both Target and Walmart use the Retail Inventory Method (RIM) to account for inventory, which directly influences their LIFO provision calculations. Target reported a LIFO provision of $153 million as of February 3, 2024, while Walmart records a quarterly LIFO adjustment based on projected annual inflation or deflation effects, with actual results finalized at year-end. Under RIM, inventory is valued by applying a cost-to-retail ratio, and markdowns are immediately recognized, which affects the LIFO provision by reflecting current market conditions and inventory valuation changes throughout the year. This approach ensures inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market, but the specific timing and methodology of LIFO adjustments differ between the two companies, impacting the magnitude and timing of their respective provisions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Target uses RIM with LIFO and had a LIFO provision of $153 million as of February 3, 2024.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Walmart uses RIM with LIFO for its U.S. segment and records quarterly LIFO adjustments based on projected annual inflation or deflation, finalized at year-end.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies apply RIM to calculate LIFO provisions, but differ in the timing and methodology of adjustments, which affects how their LIFO provisions are reported and updated throughout the fiscal year."

      "answer": "Target organizes its business across five core merchandise categories and notes that gross margins vary depending on the type of merchandise. This indicates that the company's financial performance is directly influenced by how effectively each merchandise category is managed in terms of assortment and profitability. In contrast, Walmart emphasizes the importance of predicting customer demand, managing inventory levels, and implementing competitive pricing strategies across its merchandise categories. Walmart specifically warns that failure to do so could result in excess or insufficient inventory, service interruptions, and increased costs, all of which directly impact financial performance. Therefore, while both companies rely heavily on merchandise assortment for revenue, Target focuses on variability in gross margins by category, whereas Walmart highlights inventory and cost risks tied to assortment mismanagement.",

Target similarly depends on suppliers to meet safety standards, and failure to do so could result in legal and reputational risks, including government enforcement actions and private litigation.

        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Target states that its vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and that it cannot continuously monitor every vendor, increasing risk if alternative suppliers are used. Non-compliance could lead to legal and reputational risks, including government enforcement and costly recalls.",

      "question": "Given that both Costco and Target operate in Washington state, and considering Costco's risk disclosures related to natural disasters in Washington affecting its centralized operating systems and administrative personnel, how might the geographic distribution of Target's stores across different states influence its relative resilience to localized disruptions compared to Costco's centralized infrastructure?",
      "answer": "Costco discloses that natural disasters or extreme weather events in Washington state could negatively affect its operations due to the location of its centralized operating systems and administrative personnel. In contrast, Target operates 38 stores in Washington but has a widely distributed store footprint across 49 states, with only 1.5% of its total retail square footage (4,376 of 245,939 thousand square feet) located in Washington. This broader geographic distribution may provide Target with greater operational resilience to localized disruptions in any single state compared to Costco's more centralized infrastructure located in Washington.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Costco discloses that natural disasters in Washington could negatively affect its operations due to the location of its centralized operating systems and administrative personnel.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Target operates 38 stores in Washington, representing 4,376 thousand retail square feet out of its total 245,939 thousand square feet across 1,956 stores nationwide.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While both companies operate in Washington, Costco's risk is heightened due to its centralized infrastructure located in the state, whereas Target's broader geographic distribution across 49 states may provide greater resilience to localized disruptions in Washington."

      "question": "How do MDLZ's ownership of proprietary recipes and trade secrets contrast with PepsiCo's strategy of reformulating recipes to reduce sodium, saturated fat, and added sugar, and what does this reveal about their differing approaches to leveraging recipe-related intellectual property for competitive advantage?",
      "answer": "MDLZ explicitly emphasizes its ownership of proprietary trade secrets, recipes, technology, and know-how as material to its business. It also notes that it licenses these intellectual property rights both to and from third parties, as seen in its agreement with Kraft Heinz. In contrast, PepsiCo focuses on transforming its portfolio by reformulating recipes to align with its pep+ sustainability and health goals, signaling a strategic shift in how it utilizes recipe-related intellectual property. While MDLZ treats recipes as static, protected assets that can be licensed, PepsiCo actively evolves its recipes as part of a broader transformation strategy aimed at consumer health trends and cost reduction. This contrast highlights differing financial and strategic priorities: MDLZ leverages recipes for licensing and brand protection, whereas PepsiCo uses recipe reformulation to strengthen its supply chain, reduce costs, and appeal to changing consumer preferences.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - MDLZ owns and licenses proprietary recipes and trade secrets, which are considered material to its business.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - PepsiCo is reformulating its recipes as part of its pep+ strategy to reduce sodium, saturated fat, and added sugar, aiming to align with sustainability goals and evolving consumer preferences.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The ownership model of MDLZ contrasts with PepsiCo's dynamic approach to recipe development, revealing different strategies for leveraging recipe-related intellectual property: one as a protected asset and revenue source, the other as a tool for transformation and consumer engagement."

The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors ov ersees our safety priorities, goals and performance, as well as our ESG-related disclosure in SEC filings, including controls and assurance. Our ESG goals are part of our risk and strategic planning processes and are also embedded across our organization and within our annual incentiv e compensation program for our leadership. Business leadership teams and our Board of Directors regularly rev iew progress toward these programs and priorities.\n\nWe discuss  our  ESG  goals  and  programs  in  detail  in  our  annual  Snacking  Made  Right  report  av ailable  on  our  website.  We  also  publish  an  ESG disclosure data sheet and are aligned with the  Sustainability Accounting  Standards  Board and  T ask  Force on  Climate-related  Financial  Disclosures reporting frameworks. We also prov ide our annual CDP Climate Change, Water Security and Forests disclosure.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nOur intellectual property rights (including trademarks, patents, copyrights, registered designs, proprietary trade secrets, recipes, technology and knowhow) are material to our business.\n\nWe own numerous trademarks and patents in many countries around the world. Depending on the country, trademarks remain v alid for as long as they are in use or their registration status is maintained. T rademark registrations generally are renewable for fixed terms. We also hav e patents for a number of current and potential products. Our patents cov er inv entions ranging from packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products  themselv es.  Our  issued  patents  extend  for  v arying  periods  according  to  the  date  of  patent  application  filing  or  grant  and  the  legal  term  of patents in the v arious countries where patent protection is obtained. T he actual protection afforded by a patent, which can v ary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its cov erage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country, and the av ailability of legal remedies in the country. While our patent portfolio is material to our business, the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not hav e a material adv erse effect on our business.\n\nFrom time to time, we grant third parties licenses to use one or more of our trademarks, patents and/or proprietary trade secrets in connection with the manufacture, sale or distribution of third-party products.  Similarly,  we  sell  some  products  under  brands,  patents  and/or  proprietary  trade  secrets  we license from third parties. In our agreement with Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (which is now part of The Kraft Heinz Company), we each granted the other party  v arious  licenses  to  use  certain  of  our  and  their  respectiv e  intellectual  property  rights  in  named  jurisdictions  following  the  spin-off  of  our  North American grocery business in 2012.\n\n## Regulation\n\nOur food products and ingredients are subject to local, national and multinational laws and regulations related to labeling, health and nutrition claims, packaging, pricing, marketing and adv ertising, and related areas. In addition, v arious jurisdictions regulate our operations by licensing and inspecting our manufacturing plants and facilities, enforcing standards for select food products, grading food products, and regulating trade practices related to the sale and pricing of our food products. Many of the food commodities we use in our operations are subject to gov ernment agricultural policy and interv ention. These policies hav e substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to periodic gov ernmental and administrativ e rev iew . In addition, increased attention to env ironmental and social issues in industry supply chains has led to the dev elopment of differences in gov ernment rules across jurisdictions. The lack of a harmonized approach can lead to unev en scrutiny or enforcement, which can impact our operations.\n\nExamples of laws and regulations that affect our business include, without limitation, workplace safety regulations; selectiv e food taxes; data priv acy and cybersecurity; ingredients, products, processing or other food-related",

We operate through various channels, including authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers, and other third parties, to produce, m arket, distribute, and sell a wide array of beverages and convenient foods. Our reach extends to customers and consum ers in m ore than 200 countries and territories around the world.\n\nAs a global com pany with strong local connections, we faced m any of the sam e challenges in 2024 as our consum ers, custom ers, and com petitors worldwide. These included ongoing supply chain disruptions, persistent inflationary pressures, evolving consum er preferences and behaviors, an i n ten sel y competitive business environment, the continued expansion  of e-commerce  in  a  rapidly changing retail l andscape,  ongoing macroeconomic and political volatility, and an increasingly com plex regulatory environm ent.\n\nIn response to these challenges, we have continued to adapt and innovate, reinforcing our resilience and continued focus on growth.  W e are focused  on  im proving  our  productivity ,  optim izing  our  operations  and  harnessing  our  scale  and  capabilities  across  our  m arkets,  and  further elevating the needs, occasions, and channels of consum ers in our strategies to lead and shape the future of our categories. This is underpinned by our pep+ (PepsiCo Positive) transform ation, now in its fourth year.\n\nA Strategy for the Future: pep+ is our strategy to transform  our com pany to create sustainable growth and value - today , tom orrow , and m any years into the future. It is the way we are transform ing our supply chain, evolving our portfolio, and m aking sure we have the right capabilities to support our people and our business throughout the world.\n\nAs a food and agricultural leader, we are working to help farm ers adapt to clim ate change through investm ents in regenerative agriculture, training programs, and innovative technologies. W e are operating net-zero water and energy facilities across m any m arkets, electrifying our transport fleets, and accelerating the use of recycled plastics, so we can try to build a m ore sustainable business while reducing operational costs. Our leadership in regenerative agriculture not only supports farm ers and the planet, but also strengthens our supply chain, helping us becom e m ore resilient while positioning  us  to  deliver  long-term   value  for  shareholders.  And  thanks  to  the  diversification  across  our  portfolio,  our  categories,  and  the geographies in which we operate, we are better equipped to capitalize on opportunities across a wide range of consum er needs.\n\nOur pep+ initiatives and am bitions are geared toward driving growth across every aspect of our operations, so that we can strengthen our business and deliver m ore value for our stakeholders.\n\nTransforming Our Portfolio: Our consumer-centric portfolio transform ation revolves around three key elem ents: our work to evolve our recipes to reduce sodium , saturated fat, and added sugar, while",

MDLZ notes that jurisdictions like the EU have implemented extended producer responsibility (EPR) policies and are considering plastic taxes, which require manufacturers to bear the cost of recycling packaging waste. PEP specifically highlights that these regulations, including plastic taxes and minimum recycled content requirements, have already increased costs and may further impact demand for their products, require capital expenditures for alternative packaging, and affect financial performance.

Altria experienced actuarial gains in 2022 due to a higher discount rate, which lowered its pension obligations. Conversely, the higher discount rate was a key factor in P&G\u2019s impairment of the Gillette brand, reducing its intangible asset value by $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2023.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Altria's 2022 pension plans experienced actuarial gains due to a higher discount rate, reducing pension obligations.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies were affected by the same macroeconomic factor (higher discount rate), but in opposite directions: it reduced pension liabilities for Altria while increasing impairment risk for P&G\u2019s intangible assets."

      "answer": "A higher discount rate reduced Altria's pension plan actuarial losses in 2022 but increased obligations relative to plan assets, while for Procter & Gamble, a higher discount rate contributed to a $1.3 billion before tax ($1.0 billion after tax) non-cash impairment charge on the Gillette intangible asset. Altria had $142 million in accumulated benefit obligations exceeding plan assets in 2023, and P&G's impairment reflected a direct reduction in the fair value of the Gillette asset due to the discount rate increase.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Altria's pension plans saw actuarial gains in 2022 due to a higher discount rate, and as of 2023, had $142 million in accumulated benefit obligations exceeding plan assets.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Procter & Gamble recorded a $1.3 billion before tax non-cash impairment charge on the Gillette intangible asset, partially due to a higher discount rate reducing its estimated fair value.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies were financially impacted by changes in discount rate assumptions: Altria through pension obligations and P&G through asset impairment, showing how macroeconomic conditions influence corporate financials through different mechanisms."

Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). At December 31, 2023, purchase obligations for inventory and production costs for the next 12 months were $0.9 billion and $2.5 billion thereafter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| At December 31, 2023, we had $0.7 billion of other purchase obligation commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services, which occur through the ordinary course of business. The majority of these commitments are expected to be satisfied within 12 months. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 and are excluded from the amounts above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation - As discussed previously and in Note 19, PM USA has entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states, the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories that call for certain payments. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. For further discussion of the resolutions of certain disputes with states and territories related to the NPM adjustment provision under the MSA, see Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation - NPM Adjustment Disputes in Note 19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Based on current agreements, estimated market share, estimated annual industry volume decline rates and inflation rates, the estimated amounts that we may charge to cost of sales for payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are $3.4 billion on average for the next three years. The estimated amount for 2024 includes settling plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. We expect PM USA's obligations under the State Settlement Agreements to pay these fees will terminate in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, the amount excludes the potential impact of any NPM Adjustment Items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| The estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in April of the following year. The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred. We paid approximately $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees, primarily all of which was paid in the second quarter of each period. As previously stated, the payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, inflation and certain contingent events and, in general, are allocated based on each manufacturer's market share. The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results. For further discussion on the potential impact of inflation on future payments, see Operating Results by Business Segment - State Settlement Agreements . |\n| Litigation-Related Deposits and Payments - With respect to certain adverse verdicts currently on appeal, to obtain stays of judgments pending appeals, as of December 31, 2023, PM USA had posted appeal bonds totaling $35 million, which have been collateralized with restricted cash that is included in assets on our consolidated balance sheet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Litigation is subject to uncertainty, and an adverse outcome or settlement of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year, as more fully disclosed in Note 19, Item 3 and Item 1A.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |",

      "question": "How does the potential financial liability from non-compliance with information security laws differ between Altria Group (MO) and Walmart (WMT), based on the specific business operations and regulatory obligations described in their respective 10-K filings?",
      "answer": "Altria Group (MO) faces potential financial liabilities from non-compliance with information security laws due to its reliance on third-party service providers, suppliers, and trade customers to protect sensitive data and comply with evolving global regulations on personal data protection, privacy, and artificial intelligence. These liabilities could include legal challenges, reputational harm, and significant remediation costs. Walmart (WMT), on the other hand, faces specific liabilities tied to payment card industry standards and contracts with payment card networks like Visa and Mastercard, which could make it liable for substantial penalties if payment card data is compromised. WMT also faces compliance obligations under privacy laws that may require notification and penalties in the event of a data breach. The financial impact for both companies would depend on the scope of the breach, regulatory enforcement actions, and contractual liabilities, with WMT facing more defined payment network liabilities and MO facing broader regulatory and reputational risks.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Altria Group (MO) is subject to evolving global laws on personal data protection, privacy, artificial intelligence, and information security across multiple jurisdictions, and failure to comply could result in legal challenges, reputational harm, and significant remediation costs.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Walmart (WMT) is liable under contracts with payment card processors and networks (e.g., Visa, Mastercard) if payment card data is compromised, and faces compliance obligations under privacy laws that may require notification and penalties in the event of a data breach.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies face financial risk from non-compliance with information security laws, but MO's exposure is broader and tied to global regulatory frameworks, while WMT's is more specifically tied to payment card industry standards and contractual obligations."

      "question": "How do the eligibility requirements for employer matching contributions in Altria's defined contribution plan differ from those in Walmart's 401(k) plan, and what might this suggest about their respective workforce retention strategies?",
      "answer": "Altria's defined contribution plan provides enhanced benefits to employees hired after a specific date who are not eligible for defined benefit pensions, but no specific eligibility timeline is mentioned in the filing. In contrast, Walmart's 401(k) plan allows U.S. associates to begin contributing immediately upon hire, but employer matching contributions only begin after one year of employment. This suggests that while both companies use defined contribution plans as a key retirement benefit, Walmart's structure may incentivize longer-term employment through its one-year eligibility requirement for matching contributions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From Altria's filing, we learn that employees hired on or after a specific date are not eligible for defined benefit pension plans but are instead eligible to participate in a defined contribution plan with enhanced benefits.",
        "Step 2: From Walmart's filing, we find that U.S. associates can contribute to the 401(k) plan immediately upon hire, but the company matches 100% of contributions (up to 6% of earnings) only after one year of employment.",
        "Step 3: Comparing these eligibility structures, we see that while Altria focuses on enhanced defined contribution plans for newer employees, Walmart uses a defined timeline (one year) for employer matching to potentially encourage employee retention."

Annual estimated amortization expense for each of the next five years is expected to be approximately $77.\n\nThe Company made revisions to the internal forecasts relating to its Filorga reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2021 due primarily to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Filorga skin health business as a result of government restrictions and reduced consumer mobility, which negatively impacted consumption in the duty-free, travel retail and pharmacy channels. The Company concluded that the changes in circumstances in this reporting unit triggered the need for an interim impairment review of its indefinite-lived trademark and goodwill and, accordingly, performed an interim impairment test for the trademark as of December 31, 2021. The Company concluded that the carrying value of the trademark exceeded its estimated fair value, and recorded an impairment charge of $204, reducing the carrying value to approximately $588. After adjusting the carrying value of the trademark, the Company completed a quantitative impairment test for goodwill and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $367 in the Filorga reporting unit, reducing the carrying value of goodwill to approximately $577.

To date, Altria believes its tobacco businesses have not experienced any material adverse effects associated with governmental actions to restrict consumer movement or business operations, but continues to monitor these factors. Altria continues to operate in a remote working environment for many employees and believes that remote working due to the COVID-19 pandemic has had minimal impact on productivity. Also, Altria's critical information technology systems have remained operational. Although Altria's tobacco businesses previously suspended operations temporarily at several of their manufacturing facilities in March 2020, the businesses resumed operations at those facilities under enhanced safety protocols in April 2020, and all manufacturing and nonmanufacturing facilities are currently operational under enhanced safety protocols recommended by public health authorities. Altria continues to monitor the risks associated with facility disruptions and workforce availability as a result of uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic and guidance from public health officials as it evolves its safety protocols.\n\nAltria also continues to monitor the inflationary environment arising in part from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on Altria's financial position and results of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2021, inflation did not have a material impact on Altria's MSA expense or on direct materials and other costs. While Altria anticipates that inflation will continue at increased levels in 2022, it does not believe the impacts will be material to Altria's financial position and results of operations. See Operating Results by Business Segment - Tobacco Space - State Settlement Agreements below for further discussion on MSA expense.\n\nAltria's suppliers and those within its distribution chain continue to be subject to potential facility closures, remote working protocols, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions and inflation. To date, Altria has not experienced any material disruptions to its supply chains or distribution systems. Altria continues to monitor the risk that the business of one or more suppliers, distributors or any other entities within its supply and distribution chains may be disrupted.\n\nAltria believes that the COVID-19 pandemic altered adult tobacco consumer behaviors and purchasing patterns, particularly in the earlier stages of the pandemic. While the number of adult tobacco consumer trips to the store remain below pre-pandemic levels and tobacco expenditures per trip remain elevated, the environment continues to evolve as the effects of government stimulus have lessened and consumer mobility returns to more normal levels. Although Altria's tobacco businesses have not experienced a material adverse impact to date by the COVID-19 pandemic, there is continued uncertainty as to how the COVID-19 pandemic (including changes in COVID-19-related restrictions and guidelines and new variants) may impact adult tobacco consumers in the future. Altria continues to monitor the macroeconomic risks of the COVID-19 pandemic (including risks associated with the timing and extent of vaccine administration and the impact of COVID-19 variants), and their effect on adult tobacco consumers, including stay-at-home practices and disposable income, which may be further impacted by unemployment rates and inflation. Altria also continues to monitor adult tobacco consumers' purchasing behaviors, including overall tobacco product expenditures, mix between premium and discount brand purchases and adoption of smoke-free products. See Operating Results by Business Segment - Tobacco Space Business Environment Summary below for further discussion of economic conditions and the impact on adult tobacco consumer purchasing behavior.\n\nDuring 2021, ABI continued to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the effects of COVID-19 variants, supply-chain constraints across certain markets, adverse transactional foreign exchange rates, inflation and commodity cost headwinds. While Altria considers the impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic that have negatively impacted ABI's global business to be transitory, Altria will continue to monitor its investment in ABI, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ABI's business and market valuation. See Note 6 for further discussion of Altria's investment in ABI, including the recording of a $6.2 billion non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge in 2021.\n\nAltria considered the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the business of JUUL, including its sales, distribution, operations, supply chain and liquidity, in conducting its periodic impairment assessment and quantitative valuations. JUUL's operations were negatively impacted in 2020 and 2021 by the COVID-19 pandemic due to stay-at-home practices and government-mandated restrictions. While the impact was considered in Altria's quantitative valuations conducted in connection with the preparation of its financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, Altria does not believe the COVID-19 pandemic was a primary driver of the noncash, pre-tax impairment charge recorded during 2020 or any quarterly changes in fair value recorded since the fourth quarter of 2020. Altria will continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on JUUL's business, including near-term supply chain constraints, component part shortages and inflation, in Altria's quarterly quantitative valuations of JUUL. See Note 6 for further discussion of Altria's investment in JUUL.\n\nAltria considered the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the business of Cronos, including its sales, distribution, operations, supply chain and liquidity. During 2020 and 2021, Cronos was adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, due in part to government actions limiting access to retail stores in the United States and Canada. Altria will continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Cronos's business, including as a result of new variants, near-term supply chain challenges, inflation and market valuation. See Note 6 for further discussion of Altria's investment in Cronos.",

      "answer": "Altria's adoption of ASU 2020-01 provided clarity on the interaction between equity method accounting and forward contracts, which directly influenced how the company accounted for its $250 million acquisition of the remaining 20% interest in Helix Innovations and Helix ROW. Specifically, ASU 2020-01 clarified the rules governing forward contracts and purchase options on certain types of securities, ensuring consistent application of accounting standards for such transactions. This allowed Altria to appropriately recognize and measure the equity interest acquired in Helix, which was critical in consolidating 100% ownership of the global on! oral nicotine pouch business.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_b, identify that Altria spent approximately $250 million to acquire the remaining 20% interest in Helix Innovations and Helix ROW in December 2020 and April 2021.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, note that Altria adopted ASU 2020-01 on January 1, 2021, which clarifies the interaction between equity method accounting, forward contracts, and purchase options on securities.",
        "Step 3: From evidence_source_a, confirm that ASU 2020-01 addresses the accounting for forward contracts and purchase options on certain types of securities, which is directly relevant to Altria\u2019s acquisition of the remaining Helix stake.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize that the $250 million acquisition was governed by equity method accounting and forward contract provisions clarified under ASU 2020-01, and that the adoption of this standard ensured proper recognition and measurement of the transaction in Altria\u2019s consolidated financial statements."

Background and Basis of Presentation\n\nWhen used in these notes, the term 'Altria' refers to Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise.\n\n- Background: At December 31, 2021, Altria's wholly owned subsidiaries included Philip Morris USA Inc. ('PM USA'), which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes in the United States; John Middleton Co. ('Middleton'), which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of machine-made large cigars and pipe tobacco and is a wholly owned subsidiary of PM USA; UST LLC ('UST'), which through its wholly owned subsidiary U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company LLC ('USSTC'), is engaged in the manufacture and sale of moist smokeless tobacco products ('MST') and snus products; Helix Innovations LLC ('Helix'), which operates in the United States and Canada, and Helix Innovations GmbH and its subsidiaries ('Helix ROW'), which operate internationally in the rest-of-world, are engaged in the manufacture and sale of on! oral nicotine pouches; and Philip Morris Capital Corporation ('PMCC'), which maintains a portfolio of finance assets, substantially all of which are leveraged leases. Other Altria wholly owned subsidiaries included Altria Group Distribution Company, which provides sales and distribution services to certain Altria operating subsidiaries, and Altria Client Services LLC, which provides various support services in areas such as legal, regulatory, consumer engagement, finance, human resources and external affairs to Altria. Altria's access to the operating cash flows of its wholly owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. At December 31, 2021, Altria's significant wholly owned subsidiaries were not limited by contractual obligations in their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.\n\nIn October 2021, UST sold its subsidiary, International Wine &amp; Spirits Ltd. ('IWS'), which included Ste. Michelle Wine Estates Ltd. ('Ste. Michelle'), to an entity controlled by investment funds managed by Sycamore Partners Management, L.P. in an all-cash transaction with a net purchase price of approximately $1.2 billion and the assumption of certain liabilities of IWS and its subsidiaries (the 'Ste. Michelle Transaction').\n\nIn 2019, Helix acquired Burger S\u00f6hne Holding and its subsidiaries as well as certain affiliated companies that are engaged in the manufacture and sale of on! oral nicotine pouches. At closing, Altria owned an 80% interest in Helix, for which Altria paid $353 million. At December 31, 2021, Altria owned 100% of the global on! business as a result of transactions in December 2020 and April 2021 to purchase the remaining 20% interest in (i) Helix ROW and (ii) Helix, respectively. The total purchase price of the December 2020 and April 2021 transactions was approximately $250 million.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, Altria's investments in equity securities consisted of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV ('ABI'), Cronos Group Inc. ('Cronos') and JUUL Labs, Inc. ('JUUL'). Altria accounts for its investments in ABI and Cronos under the equity method of accounting using a one-quarter lag. Altria accounts for its equity investment in JUUL under the fair value option.\n\nFor further discussion of Altria's investments in equity securities, see Note 6. Investments in Equity Securities .\n\n- Basis of Presentation: The consolidated financial statements include Altria, as well as its wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. Investments in equity securities in which Altria has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting or the fair value option. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ('GAAP') requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates and assumptions include, among other things, pension and benefit plan assumptions, lives and valuation assumptions for goodwill and other intangible assets, impairment and fair value evaluations for equity investments, marketing programs and income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\nCertain immaterial prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year's presentation.\n\nOn January 1, 2021, Altria adopted Accounting Standards Update ('ASU') 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes ('ASU No. 2019-12'). This guidance removes certain exceptions for investments, intraperiod allocations and interim calculations, and adds guidance to reduce complexity in accounting for income taxes. The adoption of ASU No. 2019-12 did not have a material impact on Altria's consolidated financial statements.\n\nAdditionally, on January 1, 2021, Altria adopted ASU No. 2020-01, Investments - Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Clarifying the Interactions between Topic 321, Topic 323, and Topic 815 ('ASU No. 2020-01'). This guidance provides clarification of the interaction of rules for equity securities, the equity method of accounting, and forward contracts and purchase options on certain types of securities. The adoption of ASU No. 2020-01 did not have a material impact on Altria's consolidated financial statements.",

Because the vast majority of our products (such as oral care products, soaps and other personal hygiene products, home cleaners and pet food) have been deemed essential for the health and well-being of people and their pets, we have, in most instances, been able to continue operating our business, although not always at full capacity. In doing so, the health, safety and well-being of our employees and their families has been and remains our first priority. In addition, some of our suppliers, customers, distributors, logistics providers and service providers have experienced disruptions to their businesses.\n\nWe saw a significant increase in demand across many of our categories, such as liquid hand soap, dish liquid, bar soap and cleaners, during 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, driven by consumer pantry-loading and increased consumption of our products. While consumer demand for most of these categories declined year-over-year in 2021, most remained above historical levels, and we believe that some of this increase in consumption is sustainable in light of changes in consumer behavior related to COVID-19. Across our business, changes in consumer demand for our products vary by product category and geography depending on, among other things, the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak, the availability of our products at retailers and supply chain disruptions.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and government steps to reduce the spread and address the impact of COVID-19 have impacted and may continue to impact our consumers' ability to purchase and our ability to manufacture and distribute our products. While we believe that, in the long-term, consumer demand for the products in our categories will continue to be strong, uncertainties continue surrounding the timing and duration of the pandemic and the recovery from it. COVID-19 has also disrupted our retail customers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers and other third parties; their ability to address COVID-19 and maintain their operations at full capacity has impacted and may continue to impact sales of and consumer access to our products. In particular, COVID-19 has disrupted, and may continue to disrupt, the travel retail channel. We expect the ongoing economic impact, health concerns associated with COVID-19 and supply chain disruptions to continue to impact consumer behavior, shopping patterns and consumption preferences during 2022.\n\nFor additional information regarding COVID-19's impact on our business, see Part I, Item 1A 'Risk Factors' and Part II, Item 7 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Overview.'\n\n## Government Regulations\n\nAs a global company, we are subject to extensive governmental regulations, including environmental rules and regulations, in the U.S. and abroad. The most significant government regulations that impact our business are discussed below. It is our policy and practice to comply with all government regulations applicable to our business. In 2021, compliance with these regulations did not have, and we do not expect such compliance in the future to have, a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. For further discussion of how global legal and regulatory requirements may impact our business, see Part I, Item 1A, 'Risk Factors.'\n\nProduct Development : Legal and regulatory requirements apply to most aspects of our products, including their development, ingredients, formulation, manufacture, packaging content, labeling, storage, transportation, distribution, export, import, advertising, sale and environmental impact. U.S. federal authorities, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Occupational, Health and Safety Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, regulate different aspects of our business, along with parallel authorities at the state and local levels and comparable authorities overseas.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n- Federal, State and Local Legislation to Increase the Legal Age to Purchase Tobacco Products: After a number of states and localities proposed and enacted legislation to increase the minimum age to purchase all tobacco products, including e-vapor products, in December 2019, the federal government passed legislation increasing the minimum age to purchase all tobacco products, including e-vapor products, to 21 nationwide. As of February 22, 2022, 39 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have enacted laws increasing the legal age to purchase tobacco products to 21. Although an increase in the minimum age to purchase tobacco products may have a negative impact on sales volume of our tobacco businesses, as discussed above under Underage Access and Use of Certain Tobacco Products, Altria supports raising the minimum legal age to purchase all tobacco products to 21 at the federal and state levels, reflecting its longstanding commitment to combat underage tobacco use.\n- Health Effects of Tobacco Products, Including E-vapor Products: Reports with respect to the health effects of smoking have been publicized for many years, including various reports by the U.S. Surgeon General. In 2019, there were public health advisories concerning vaping-related lung injuries and deaths and there have been health concerns raised about potential increased risks associated with COVID-19 among smokers and vapers. Altria believes that the public should be guided by the messages of the U.S. Surgeon General and public health authorities worldwide in making decisions concerning the use of tobacco products, including evapor products.\n\nMost jurisdictions within the United States have restricted smoking in public places and some have restricted vaping in public places. Some public health groups have called for, and various jurisdictions have adopted or proposed, bans on smoking and vaping in outdoor places, in private apartments and in cars transporting children. It is not possible to predict the results of ongoing scientific research or the types of future scientific research into the health risks of tobacco exposure and the impact of such research on legislation and regulation.\n\n- Other Legislation or Governmental Initiatives: In addition to the actions discussed above, other regulatory initiatives affecting the tobacco industry have been adopted or are being considered at the federal level and in a number of state and local jurisdictions. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, state and local governments required additional health and safety requirements of all businesses, including tobacco manufacturing and other facilities. State and local governments also mandated the temporary closure of some businesses. While many restrictions have eased, it is possible that tobacco manufacturing and other facilities and the facilities of our suppliers, our suppliers' suppliers and our trade partners could be subject to additional government-mandated temporary closures and restrictions.\n\nAdditionally, in recent years, legislation has been introduced or enacted at the state or local level to subject tobacco products to various reporting requirements and performance standards; establish educational campaigns relating to tobacco consumption or tobacco control programs or provide additional funding for governmental tobacco control activities; restrict the sale of tobacco products in certain retail establishments and the sale of tobacco products in certain package sizes; prohibit the sale of tobacco products based on environmental concerns; require tax stamping of smokeless tobacco products; require the use of state tax stamps using data encryption technology; and further restrict the sale, marketing and advertising of cigarettes and other tobacco products. Such legislation may be subject to constitutional or other challenges on various grounds, which may or may not be successful.\n\nIt is not possible to predict what, if any, additional legislation, regulation or other governmental action will be enacted or implemented (and, if challenged, upheld) relating to the manufacturing, design, packaging, marketing, advertising, sale or use of tobacco products, or the tobacco industry generally. It is possible, however, that legislation, regulation or other governmental action could be enacted or implemented that could have a material adverse impact on the business and volume of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees, and the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL.\n\n- Governmental Investigations: From time to time, Altria and its subsidiaries and investees are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters.  For example: (i) the FTC issued a Civil Investigative Demand ('CID') to Altria while conducting its antitrust review of Altria's investment in JUUL seeking information regarding, among other things, Altria's role in the resignation of JUUL's former chief executive officer and the hiring by JUUL of any current or former Altria director, executive or employee (see Note 18 and Item 3 for a description of the FTC's administrative complaint against Altria and JUUL); (ii) the SEC commenced an investigation relating to Altria's acquisition, disclosures and accounting controls in connection with the JUUL investment; and (iii) the New York State Office of the Attorney General and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Office of the Attorney General, separately, issued independent subpoenas to Altria seeking documents relating to Altria's investment in and provision of services to JUUL. Additionally, JUUL is currently under investigation by various federal and state agencies, including the SEC, the FDA and the FTC, and state attorneys general.  Such investigations vary in scope but at least some appear to include JUUL's marketing practices, particularly as such practices relate to youth, and Altria may be asked in the context of those investigations to provide information concerning its investment in JUUL or relating to its marketing of Nu Mark LLC e-vapor products.\n\n## Private Sector Activity on E-Vapor\n\nA number of retailers, including national chains, have discontinued the sale of e-vapor products.

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) faces significant risks from trade agreements, including potential increases in tariffs, trade restrictions, and the uncertainty of post-Brexit trade dynamics under the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which could reduce international revenues and increase supply costs. Meanwhile, Altria (MO) directly incorporates trade agreements into its financial operations by structuring variable payments\u2014such as price promotions and wholesale/retail participation incentives\u2014into revenue recognition practices, with these incentives explicitly tied to trade agreements with partners. While CL\u2019s exposure is risk-based and external, MO actively manages internal financial obligations tied to trade agreements, such as recording estimated sales returns and incentives as reductions to revenue, with $287 million in deferred revenue recorded in 2021.",

RISK FACTORS\n\nIn addition to the risks described elsewhere in this report, set forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities. These risks, some of which have occurred and/or are occurring and any of which could occur in the future, are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted, which might cause the value of our securities to decline.\n\n## Business and Industry Risks\n\n## We face risks associated with significant international operations, including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.\n\nWe operate on a global basis serving consumers in more than 200 countries and territories with approximately 70% of our Net sales originating in markets outside the U.S. While geographic diversity helps to reduce our exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world, it also means that we face risks associated with significant international operations, including, but not limited to:\n\n- changing macroeconomic conditions in our markets, including as a result of inflation, volatile commodity prices and increases in the cost of raw and packaging materials, labor, energy and logistics;\n- political or economic instability, geopolitical events, environmental events, widespread health emergencies, such as COVID19 or other pandemics or epidemics, natural disasters or social or labor unrest;\n- changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenues, profits and cash flows from non-U.S. markets or increase our supply costs, as measured in U.S. dollars, in those markets;\n- exchange controls and other limits on our ability to import or export raw materials or finished product, including as a result of COVID-19, or to repatriate earnings from overseas;\n- lack of well-established, reliable and/or impartial legal systems in certain countries where we operate and difficulties in enforcing contractual, intellectual property or other legal rights;\n- foreign ownership and investment restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources; and\n- changes to trade policies and agreements and other foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements, including those resulting in potentially adverse tax consequences or the imposition of and/or the increase in onerous trade restrictions and/or tariffs, sanctions, price controls, labor laws, travel or immigration restrictions, including as a result of COVID-19 or other pandemics or epidemics, profit controls or other government controls.\n\nAny or all of the foregoing risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, a number of these risks may adversely impact consumer confidence and consumption, which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings.\n\nIn addition, there continue to be uncertainties related to the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union ('EU') (commonly referred to as Brexit), including the long-term impact of the bilateral trade and cooperation deal governing the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU (the 'EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement'). These uncertainties include the impact of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement on businesses in the EU and the United Kingdom and how the new relationship between the EU and the United Kingdom will develop over time, including disruptions to trade and the free movement of goods, services and people to and from the United Kingdom, increased foreign exchange volatility with respect to the British pound and/or the euro and disruptions to our workforce and that of",

          "chunk_text": "\n## Note 3. Revenues from Contracts with Customers\n\nAltria disaggregates net revenues based on product type. For further discussion, see Note 15. Segment Reporting .\n\nIn 2020, a majority of Altria's businesses offered cash discounts to customers for prompt payment and calculated cash discounts as a percentage of the list price based on historical experience and agreed-upon payment terms. Beginning in the first quarter of 2021 for USSTC and in the third quarter of 2021 for PM USA, cash discounts were calculated as a flat rate per unit, based on agreed-upon payment terms. Altria's businesses record receivables net of the cash discounts on Altria's consolidated balance sheets.\n\nAltria's businesses that receive payments in advance of product shipment record such payments as deferred revenue. These payments are included in other accrued liabilities on Altria's consolidated balance sheets until control of such products is obtained by the customer. Deferred revenue was $287 million and $301 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. When cash is received in advance of product shipment, Altria's businesses satisfy their performance obligations within three days of receiving payment. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no differences between amounts recorded as deferred revenue and amounts subsequently recognized as revenue.\n\nReceivables were $47 million and $137 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively; the decrease was due primarily to the Ste. Michelle Transaction. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no expected differences between amounts recorded and subsequently received, and Altria's businesses did not record an allowance for doubtful accounts against these receivables.\n\nAltria's businesses record an allowance for returned goods, which is included in other accrued liabilities on Altria's consolidated balance sheets. While all of Altria's tobacco operating companies sell tobacco products with dates relative to freshness as printed on product packaging, it is USSTC's policy to accept authorized sales returns from its customers for products that have passed such dates due to the limited shelf life of USSTC's MST and snus products. Altria's businesses record estimated sales returns, which are based principally on historical volume and return rates, as a reduction to revenues. Actual sales returns will differ from estimated sales returns to the extent actual results differ from estimated assumptions. Altria's businesses reflect differences between actual and estimated sales returns in the period in which the actual amounts become known. These differences, if any, have not had a material impact on Altria's consolidated financial statements. All returned goods are destroyed upon return and not included in inventory. Consequently, Altria's businesses do not record an asset for their right to recover goods from customers upon return.\n\nSales incentives include variable payments related to goods sold by Altria's businesses. Altria's businesses include estimates of variable consideration as a reduction to revenues upon shipment of goods to customers. The sales incentives that require significant estimates and judgments are as follows:\n\n- Price promotion paymentsAltria's businesses make price promotion payments, substantially all of which are made to their retail partners to incent the promotion of certain product offerings in select geographic areas.\n- Wholesale and retail participation paymentsAltria's businesses make payments to their wholesale and retail partners to incent merchandising and sharing of sales data in accordance with each business's trade agreements.\n\nThese estimates primarily include estimated wholesale to retail sales volume and historical acceptance rates. Actual payments will differ from estimated payments to the extent actual results differ from estimated assumptions. Differences between actual and estimated payments are reflected in the period such information becomes available. These differences, if any, have not had a material impact on Altria's consolidated financial statements.",

Altria Group, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes those written policies and procedures that:\n\n- n pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Altria Group, Inc.;\n- n provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America;\n- n provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of Altria Group, Inc. are being made only in accordance with the authorization of management and directors of Altria Group, Inc.; and\n- n provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nInternal control over financial reporting includes the controls themselves, monitoring and internal auditing practices and actions taken to correct deficiencies as identified.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

Our third-party service providers and business partners may not fulfill their respective commitments and responsibilities in a timely manner and in accordance with the agreedupon terms. In addition, while we have procedures in place for selecting and managing our relationships with third-party service providers and other business partners, we do not have control over their business operations or governance and compliance systems, practices and procedures, which increases our financial, legal, reputational and operational risk. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships, or for any reason our third-party service providers or business partners fail to satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities, our financial results could suffer.\n\n## If we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, or if we or our bottling partners experience strikes, work stoppages or labor unrest, our business could suffer.\n\nMany of our employees at our key manufacturing locations and bottling plants are covered by collective bargaining agreements. While we generally have been able to renegotiate collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire and regard our relations with employees and their representatives as generally satisfactory, negotiations may nevertheless be challenging, as the Company must have competitive cost structures in each market while meeting the compensation and benefits needs of our employees. If we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, our labor costs could increase, which could affect our profit margins. In addition, many of our bottling partners' employees are represented by labor unions. Strikes, work stoppages or other forms of labor unrest at any of our major manufacturing facilities or at our bottling operations or our major bottlers' plants could impair our ability to supply concentrates and syrups to our bottling partners or our bottlers' ability to supply finished beverages to customers, which could reduce our net operating revenues and could expose us to customer claims. Furthermore, from time to time we and our bottling partners restructure manufacturing and other operations to improve productivity, which may have negative impacts on employee morale and work performance, result in escalation of grievances and adversely affect the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements. If these labor relations are not effectively managed at the local level, they could escalate in the form of corporate campaigns supported by the labor organizations and could negatively affect our Company's overall reputation and brand image, which in turn could have a negative impact on our products' acceptance by consumers.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS\n\n## Obesity and other health-related concerns may reduce demand for some of our products.\n\nThere is growing concern among consumers, public health professionals and government agencies about the health problems associated with obesity. Increasing public concern about obesity; other health-related public concerns surrounding consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages; possible new or increased taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages by government entities to reduce consumption or to raise revenue; additional governmental regulations concerning the advertising, marketing, labeling, packaging or sale of our sugar-sweetened beverages; and negative publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against us or other companies in our industry relating to the marketing, labeling or sale of sugar-sweetened beverages may reduce demand for, or increase the cost of, our sugar-sweetened beverages, which could adversely affect our profitability.\n\n## If we do not address evolving consumer product and shopping preferences, our business could suffer.\n\nConsumer product preferences have evolved and continue to evolve as a result of, among other things, health, wellness and nutrition considerations, including concerns regarding caloric intake associated with sugar-sweetened beverages and the perceived undesirability of artificial ingredients; shifting consumer demographics; changes in consumer tastes and needs coupled with a rapid expansion of beverage options and delivery methods; changes in consumer lifestyles; concerns regarding location of origin or source of ingredients and raw materials and the environmental, social and sustainability impact of ingredient sources and the product manufacturing process; consumer emphasis on transparency related to ingredients we use in our products and collection and recyclability of, and amount of recycled content contained in, our packaging containers and other materials; concerns about the health and welfare of animals in our dairy supply chain; and competitive product and pricing pressures. In addition, in many of our markets, shopping patterns are being affected by the digital evolution, with consumers rapidly embracing shopping by way of mobile device applications, e-commerce retailers and e-commerce websites or platforms. If we fail to address changes in consumer product and shopping preferences, do not successfully anticipate and prepare for future changes in such preferences, or are ineffective or slow in developing and implementing appropriate digital transformation initiatives, our share of sales, revenue growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected.\n\n## Product safety and quality concerns could negatively affect our business.\n\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all of our products. We have rigorous product safety and quality standards, which we expect our operations as well as our bottling partners to meet. However, despite our strong commitment to product safety and quality, we or our bottling partners periodically have not met, and may not always meet, these standards, particularly as we expand our product offerings through innovation or acquisitions into beverage categories, such as value-added dairy and plant-based beverages, that are beyond our",

In addition, three of our largest states by total sales are California, Texas, and Florida, areas where natural disasters are more prevalent. Natural disasters in those states or in other areas where our sales or operations are concentrated could result in significant physical damage to or closure of one or more of our stores, distribution centers, facilities, or key vendors. In addition, weather conditions, natural disasters, and other catastrophic events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, in areas where we or our vendors have operations, could adversely affect the availability or cost of certain products within our supply chain,  cause  delays  in  the  distribution  of  merchandise  from  our  vendors  to  our  distribution  centers,  stores,  and  guests,  affect consumer purchasing power, or reduce consumer demand, which could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our costs and lowering our sales.\n\nWe rely on a large, global, and changing workforce of team members, contractors, and temporary staffing. If we do not effectively manage our workforce and the concentration of work in certain global locations, our labor costs and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nWith over 400,000 team members, our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense, and our business is dependent on our  ability  to  attract,  train,  and  retain  the  appropriate  mix  of  qualified  team  members,  contractors,  and  temporary  staffing  and effectively organize and manage those resources as our business and strategic priorities change. Many team members are in entrylevel or part-time positions with historically high turnover rates. Our ability to meet our changing labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as labor laws and regulations, unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, benefit costs, changing demographics, and our reputation and relevance within the labor market. Our ability to meet those labor needs could be further strained by expanded laws, regulations, and mandates adopted in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. If we are unable to attract and retain a workforce meeting our needs, our operations, guest service levels, support functions, and competitiveness could suffer and our results of operations could be adversely affected. We are periodically subject to labor organizing efforts and activism, which could negatively impact how we are perceived by team members and our overall reputation. If we become subject to one or more collective bargaining agreements in the future, it could adversely affect our labor costs, how we operate our business, and our results  of  operations.  In  addition  to  our  United  States  operations,  we  have  support  offices  in  India  and  China,  and  any extended disruption of our operations in our different locations, whether due to labor difficulties or otherwise, could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\n\nFailure to address product safety and sourcing concerns and meet evolving expectations for reporting on ESG matters could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.\n\nIf our merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or Target's or our guests' expectations regarding safety, supply chain transparency, and responsible sourcing, we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk. All of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards. Events that give rise to actual, potential, or perceived product safety concerns, including food or drug contamination and product defects, could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities. Our sourcing vendors, including any third parties selling through our digital channels, must also meet our expectations across multiple areas of social compliance, including supply chain transparency and responsible sourcing. We have a social compliance audit process that performs audits regularly, but we cannot continuously monitor every vendor, so we are also dependent on our vendors to ensure that the products we buy comply with our standards. If we need to seek alternative sources of supply from vendors with whom we have less familiarity, the risk of our standards not being met may increase. Expectations from shareholders, guests, team members, and other third parties concerning ESG reporting have increased, and our ability to meet those expectations is dependent on a variety of factors, including cooperation from sourcing vendors and other third parties and having access to consistent and reliable data. Negative guest perceptions regarding the safety and sourcing of the products we sell and the sufficiency and transparency of our reporting on ESG matters, and events that give rise to actual, potential, or perceived compliance and social responsibility concerns could hurt our reputation, result in lost sales, cause our guests to seek alternative sources for their needs, and make it difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our guests.",

Significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, and in evaluating the  ultimate  resolution  of  tax  matters  in  dispute  with  tax  authorities.  The  benefits  of  uncertain  tax  positions  are  recorded  in  our financial statements only after determining it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities. We periodically reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, were $138 million and $193 million as of January 29, 2022, and January 30, 2021, respectively. We believe the resolution of these matters will not materially affect our consolidated financial statements. Income taxes are described further in Note 19 to the Financial Statements.\n\nPension accounting: We  maintain  a  funded  qualified  defined  benefit  pension  plan,  as  well  as  nonqualified  and  international pension plans that are generally unfunded, for certain current and retired team members. The costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs. Eligibility and the level of benefits vary depending  on  each  team  member's  full-time  or  part-time  status,  date  of  hire,  age,  length  of  service,  and/or  compensation.  The benefit obligation and related expense for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using assumptions about the expected long-term rate of return, the discount rate, compensation growth rates, mortality, and retirement age. These assumptions, with adjustments made for any significant plan or participant changes, are used to determine the period-end benefit obligation and establish expense for the next year.\n\nOur 2021 expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 5.80 percent was determined by the portfolio composition, historical long-term investment performance, and current market conditions. A 1 percentage point decrease in our expected long-term rate of return would increase annual expense by $41 million.\n\nThe discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long-term high-quality corporate bonds, using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. Our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. A 1 percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by $62 million.\n\nBased  on  our  experience,  we  use  a  graduated  compensation  growth  schedule  that  assumes  higher  compensation  growth  for younger, shorter-service pension-eligible team members than it does for older, longer-service pension-eligible team members.\n\nPension benefits are further described in Note 24 to the Financial Statements.\n\nLegal and other contingencies: We  believe  the  accruals  recorded in our consolidated financial statements properly reflect loss exposures that are both probable and reasonably estimable. We do not believe any of the currently identified claims or litigation will materially affect our results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, it may cause a material adverse impact on the results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs, or future periods. Refer to Note 15  to  the Financial Statements for further information on contingencies.\n\n## New Accounting Pronouncements\n\nWe do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements.\n\nTARGET CORPORATION\n\n2021 Form 10-K",

KO highlights that lower vaccination rates or resurgences of the virus could delay recovery, leading to potential impairment charges. Meanwhile, TGT faces team member management challenges from vaccine mandates, including dissatisfaction, attrition, and increased compliance costs. TGT notes that these mandates could disrupt scheduling, increase turnover-related inefficiencies, and negatively affect store operations and guest experience.

          "chunk_text": "variable interest is referred to as a 'VIE.' An enterprise must consolidate a VIE if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\n\nOur Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling operations, for which we were not determined to be the primary beneficiary. Our variable interests in these VIEs primarily relate to equity investments, profit guarantees or subordinated financial support. Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Although these financial arrangements resulted in our holding variable interests in these entities, they did not empower us to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance. Creditors of our VIEs do not have recourse against the general credit of the Company, regardless of whether the VIEs are accounted for as consolidated entities.\n\nWe use the equity method to account for investments in companies if our investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. Our consolidated net income includes our Company's proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies. Our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investee includes considering key factors such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intercompany transactions.\n\nWe eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions, including the intercompany transactions with consolidated VIEs and the intercompany portion of transactions with equity method investees.\n\n## Recoverability of Current and Noncurrent Assets\n\nOur Company faces many uncertainties and risks related to various economic, political and regulatory environments in the countries in which we operate, particularly in developing and emerging markets. Refer to the heading 'Our Business - Challenges and Risks' above and 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' in Part I of this report. As a result, management must make numerous assumptions, which involve a significant amount of judgment, when performing recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets in various regions around the world.\n\nWe perform recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For certain assets, recoverability and/or impairment tests are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For other assets, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired.\n\nThe performance of recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets involves critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management judgment, include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management must estimate include, among others, the economic lives of the assets, sales volume, pricing, royalty rates, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, the impact of any supply chain disruptions, inflation, long-term growth rates, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates, capital spending, proceeds from the sale of assets and customers' financial condition. These factors are even more difficult to estimate as a result of uncertainties associated with the scope, severity and duration of the global COVID-19 pandemic and any resurgences of the pandemic, including, but not limited to, the number of people contracting the virus; the impact of shelter-in-place and social distancing requirements; the impact of governmental actions across the globe to contain the virus; vaccine availability, rates of vaccination and effectiveness of vaccines against existing and new variants of the virus; governmental or other vaccine mandates and any associated business and supply chain disruptions; and the substance and pace of the economic recovery. The estimates we use when performing recoverability tests of assets are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. When performing impairment tests, we estimate the fair values of the assets using management's best assumptions, which we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use. The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. While uncertainties still exist, we expect to see continued improvements in our business as vaccines become more widely available, as vaccination rates increase, and as consumers return to many of their previous work routines as well as socializing and traveling. The Company has certain intangible and other long-lived assets that are more dependent on cash flows generated in the away-fromhome channels and/or that generate cash flows in geographic areas that are more heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and are therefore more susceptible to impairment. In addition, intangible and other long-lived assets we acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, because they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and macroeconomic conditions at the time of acquisition. If we had used other assumptions and estimates when tests of these assets were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions in future periods, or if different conditions exist in future periods, impairment charges could result. The total future impairment charges we may be required to record could be material. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent acquisitions.

Governments have taken various measures in response to COVID-19, including mandating the closure of certain businesses and encouraging or requiring citizens to avoid large gatherings. In addition,  we  have  incurred  significant  expenses  related  to  efforts  to  protect  the  health  and  well-being  of  our  guests  and  team members. Nearly all of our stores, digital channels, and distribution centers have remained open during the COVID-19 pandemic, though at times we have had to temporarily alter other parts of our operations, including adjusting our in-store returns process, suspending physical inventory counts at our stores, metering guest traffic, reducing store hours, and, in some locations, restricting access  to  'non-essential'  sections  of  our  stores  due  to  emergency  operating  restrictions.  Those  temporary  alterations  to  our operations have at times adversely affected, and could again in the future, either alone or with any negative guest or team member perceptions  about  the  cleanliness  and  safety  of  our  stores,  adversely  affect  the  guest  experience,  sales,  and  our  results  of operations.\n\nDifferent  COVID-19  vaccines  and  boosters  have  been  developed  and  are  being  distributed.  As  additional  COVID-19  response measures, in certain jurisdictions, we are subject to vaccine mandates that apply to our team members, guests, and/or others who are in our stores and other buildings. We may be subject to similar or additional measures as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. Our  implementation  of  these  mandates  and  any  requirements  for  showing  compliance  with  them,  may  result  in  team  member dissatisfaction or unrest, attrition of existing team members, difficulty in attracting new team members, inefficiencies related to team member  turnover,  increased  costs  related  to  ongoing  compliance,  scheduling  disruptions,  and  negative  guest  perceptions  or experiences, which could adversely affect our reputation, sales and results of operations.\n\nThe full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial position, and results of operations will depend on future developments, many of which are outside of our control, including the duration and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the emergence of variant strains, the availability,  adoption,  and  effectiveness  of  the  COVID-19  vaccines  and  COVID-19  testing,  and government actions, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. The fluidity of this situation limits our ability to predict the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our business, financial condition, and financial performance, which could be material.\n\n## Our earnings depend on the state of macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence in the U.S.\n\nNearly all of our sales are in the U.S., making our results highly dependent on the health of the U.S. economy and U.S. consumer confidence,  which  can  be  affected  by  a  variety  of  factors,  including  housing  prices,  unemployment  rates,  and  inflation.  A deterioration  in  U.S.  macroeconomic  conditions  or  consumer  confidence,  the  likelihood  of  which  is  made  more  uncertain  by  the unknown duration, severity, and lasting impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and recent increases in the inflation rate, could adversely affect our business in many ways, including slowing sales growth, reducing overall sales, and reducing gross margins.\n\nSuch a deterioration could adversely affect additional areas of our business, such as asset impairment evaluations and the amount of credit card profit-sharing revenue payments we receive under our credit card program with TD Bank Group (TD), which owns the receivables generated by our proprietary credit cards. We could also receive lower profit-sharing payments if changes in consumer preferences regarding use of revolving credit cards adversely affect the volume of new credit accounts, the amount of credit card program balances, and/or the ability of credit card holders to pay their balances.\n\nTARGET CORPORATION\n\n2021 Form 10-K",

      "answer": "The Coca-Cola Company (KO) lists Danone S.A. as one of its global competitors in the commercial beverage industry, emphasizing competition across a wide range of beverage categories including sparkling soft drinks, water, juices, and plant-based beverages. Meanwhile, Mondel\u0113z International (MDLZ) includes Danone S.A. in its performance peer group, indicating that it views Danone as a benchmark for executive compensation and corporate performance within the broader Consumer Staples sector. This shows that while both KO and MDLZ recognize Danone S.A. as a key industry player, KO competes directly with Danone in beverage markets, whereas MDLZ aligns with Danone in terms of strategic and performance-based industry comparisons, reflecting different competitive dynamics within the same sector.",

          "chunk_text": "## Promotional and Marketing Programs\n\nIn addition to conducting our own independent advertising and marketing activities, we may provide promotional and marketing support and/or funds to our bottlers. In most cases, we do this on a discretionary basis under the terms of commitment letters or agreements, even though we are not obligated to do so under the terms of the bottler's agreements between our Company and the bottlers. Also, on a discretionary basis in most cases, our Company may develop and introduce new products, packages and equipment to assist the bottlers. Likewise, in many instances, we provide promotional and marketing support and/or funds and/or dispensing equipment and repair services to fountain and bottle/can retailers, typically pursuant to marketing agreements.\n\n## Investments in Bottling Operations\n\nMost of our branded beverage products are prepared, packaged, distributed and sold by independent bottling partners. However, from time to time we acquire or take control of a bottling operation, often in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance. Owning a bottling operation enables us to compensate for limited local resources; help focus the bottler's sales and marketing programs; assist in the development of the bottler's business and information systems; and establish an appropriate capital structure for the bottler. In line with our long-term bottling strategy, we may periodically consider options for divesting or reducing our ownership interest in a consolidated bottling operation, typically by selling all or a portion of our interest in the bottling operation to an independent bottler to improve Coca-Cola system efficiency. When we sell a consolidated bottling operation to an independent bottling partner in which we have an equity method investment, our Company continues to participate in the bottler's results of operations through our share of the equity method investee's earnings or losses.\n\nIn addition, from time to time we make equity investments representing noncontrolling interests in certain bottling operations with the intention of maximizing the strength and efficiency of the Coca-Cola system's production, marketing, sales and distribution capabilities around the world by providing expertise and resources to strengthen those businesses. These investments are intended to result in increases in unit case volume, net operating revenues and profits at the bottler level, which in turn generate increased sales for our Company's concentrate operations. When our equity investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee bottler's operating and financial policies, we account for the investment under the equity method.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nSales of our ready-to-drink beverages are somewhat seasonal, with the second and third calendar quarters historically accounting for the highest sales volumes. The volume of sales in the beverage business may be affected by weather conditions.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe commercial beverage industry is highly competitive and consists of numerous companies, ranging from small or emerging to very large and well established. These include companies that, like our Company, compete globally in multiple geographic areas, as well as businesses that are primarily regional or local in operation. Competitive products include numerous nonalcoholic sparkling soft drinks; water products, including flavored and enhanced waters; juices, juice drinks and nectars; dilutables (including syrups and powders); coffees; teas; energy drinks; sports drinks; milk and other dairy-based drinks; plant-based beverages; functional beverages, including vitamin-based products and relaxation beverages; and various other nonalcoholic beverages. These competitive products are sold to consumers in both ready-to-drink and non-ready-to-drink form. The Company has directly entered the alcohol beverage category in numerous markets outside the United States. In the United States, the Company has established a wholly owned, indirect, firewalled subsidiary, which uses third-party manufacturers and distributors to produce and sell alcohol products in certain regions of the United States and also authorizes alcohol-licensed third parties to use certain of our trademarks and related intellectual property on alcohol beverages that contain Company beverage bases. Competitive products include all alcohol ready-to-drink beverages containing various alcohol bases. In many of the countries in which we do business, PepsiCo, Inc. is a primary competitor. Other significant competitors include, but are not limited to, Nestl\u00e9 S.A., Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., Danone S.A., Suntory Beverage &amp; Food Limited, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Kirin Holdings, Heineken N.V., Diageo plc and Red Bull GmbH. We also compete against numerous regional and local companies and, increasingly, against smaller companies that are developing microbrands and selling them directly to consumers through e-commerce retailers and other e-commerce platforms. In addition, in some markets, we compete against retailers that have developed their own store or private-label beverage brands.\n\nCompetitive factors impacting our business include, but are not limited to, pricing, advertising, sales promotion programs,     in-store displays and point-of-sale marketing, digital marketing, product and ingredient innovation, availability, increased efficiency in production techniques, the introduction of new packaging as well as new vending and dispensing equipment, contracting with marketing assets (theaters, sports arenas, universities, etc.), and brand and trademark development and protection.",

      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) specifically highlights that public concern about substances used in packaging materials, such as bisphenol A (BPA), may affect consumer preferences and cause them to shift away from some of its beverage products. This reflects a demand-side risk tied directly to consumer perception of packaging safety, which could reduce revenue and profitability. Mondel\u0113z (MDLZ), on the other hand, states that it is subject to evolving regulations across jurisdictions related to labeling, packaging, and environmental supply chain policies. The lack of harmonized regulatory approaches creates uneven scrutiny and enforcement, which can increase compliance costs and disrupt operations. Together, these issues illustrate how Packaging Regulations pose both reputational and compliance risks that can directly impact revenue, cost structures, and long-term sustainability strategies for consumer staples companies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from KO's filing - KO specifically mentions that consumer concerns about substances like BPA in packaging could reduce demand for its products, affecting profitability.",
        "Step 2: Extract from MDLZ's filing - MDLZ notes exposure to diverse and evolving packaging and labeling regulations across jurisdictions, which can lead to increased compliance costs and operational disruptions.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies face distinct but interconnected risks stemming from Packaging Regulations: KO from a consumer perception and demand standpoint, and MDLZ from a regulatory compliance and operational standpoint. Together, these represent the dual financial and operational risks facing consumer staples companies under current regulatory frameworks."

Ongoing public concern about obesity; other health-related public concerns surrounding consumption of sweetened beverages; the effects or perceived effects of the usage of weight-loss drugs on consumption patterns; potential new or increased taxes on sweetened beverages by government entities to reduce consumption or to raise revenue; potential new or increased governmental regulations on particular ingredients or additives in our beverages and packaging, or on manufacturing processes; additional governmental regulations concerning the advertising, marketing, labeling, packaging or sale of our sweetened beverages; and negative publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against us or other companies in our industry relating to the marketing, labeling or sale of sweetened beverages may reduce demand for, or increase the cost of, our sweetened beverages, which could adversely affect our profitability.\n\n## If we do not address evolving consumer product and shopping preferences, our business could suffer.\n\nConsumer product preferences have evolved and continue to evolve as a result of, among other things, health, wellness and nutrition considerations, including concerns regarding caloric intake associated with sweetened beverages and the perceived undesirability of artificial ingredients or processing; concerns regarding the perceived health effects of, or location of origin of, ingredients, raw materials or substances in our products or packaging, including due to the results of thirdparty studies (whether or not scientifically valid); shifting consumer demographics; changes in consumer tastes and needs coupled with a rapid expansion of beverage options and delivery methods; changes in consumer lifestyles; concerns regarding the environmental, social and sustainability impact of ingredient sources, the product manufacturing process and our packaging; consumer emphasis on transparency related to ingredients we use in our products and collection and recyclability of, and amount of recycled content contained in, our packaging containers and other materials; concerns about the health and welfare of animals in our dairy supply chain; and competitive product and pricing pressures. In addition, in many of our markets, shopping patterns are being affected by the digital evolution, with consumers rapidly embracing shopping by way of mobile device applications, e-commerce retailers and e-commerce websites or platforms. If we fail to address changes in consumer product and shopping preferences, do not successfully anticipate and prepare for future changes in such preferences, or are ineffective or slow in developing and implementing appropriate digital transformation initiatives, our share of sales, revenue growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected.\n\n## Product safety and quality concerns could negatively affect our business.\n\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all of our products. We have rigorous product safety and quality standards that we expect our operations, bottling partners and contract manufacturers to meet. However, despite our strong commitment to product safety and quality, we or our bottling partners at times have not met, and may not always meet, these standards, particularly as we expand our product offerings through innovation or acquisitions into beverage categories, such as value-added dairy and plant-based beverages, that are beyond our traditional range of beverage products. We and our bottling partners have had, and may in the future need, to recall products if they become contaminated or adulterated by any means, or if they are mislabeled or do not meet applicable regulatory requirements. In addition, we or our bottling partners and products have been, and could continue to be, subject to inspection by federal, state and local authorities, which could result in the identification of product quality or safety issues. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time, and could also subject us to product liability claims and negative publicity, all of which could cause our business to suffer.\n\nPublic debate and concern about perceived negative health consequences of processing and of certain ingredients, such as nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners, color additives and biotechnology-derived substances, and of other substances present in our beverage products or packaging materials, may reduce demand for our beverage products or result in additional governmental regulation.\n\nPublic debate and concern about perceived negative health consequences of processing and of certain ingredients in our beverage products, such as synthetic colors, nutritive (e.g., sugar, HFCS) and non-nutritive sweeteners, biotechnology-derived substances and other additives; substances that are present in our beverage products naturally or that occur as a result of the manufacturing process, such as 4-methylimidazole (4-MEI), a chemical compound that is formed during the manufacturing of certain types of caramel coloring used in cola-flavored beverages; or substances used in packaging materials, such as bisphenol A (BPA), an odorless, tasteless food-grade chemical commonly used in the food and beverage industries as a component in the coating of the interior of cans, may affect consumers' preferences and cause them to shift away from some of our beverage",

T he actual protection afforded by a patent, which can v ary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its cov erage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country, and the av ailability of legal remedies in the country.

Similarly,  we  sell  some  products  under  brands,  patents  and/or  proprietary  trade  secrets  we license from third parties. In our agreement with Kraft Foods Group, Inc.

In addition, v arious jurisdictions regulate our operations by licensing and inspecting our manufacturing plants and facilities, enforcing standards for select food products, grading food products, and regulating trade practices related to the sale and pricing of our food products.

These policies hav e substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to periodic gov ernmental and administrativ e rev iew . In addition, increased attention to env ironmental and social issues in industry supply chains has led to the dev elopment of differences in gov ernment rules across jurisdictions.

Advertising costs included in the line item selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income were $5 billion, $5 billion and $4 billion in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, advertising and production costs of $25 million and $43 million, respectively, were primarily recorded in the line item prepaid ex penses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Shipping and Handling Costs\n\nShipping and handling costs related to the movement of goods from our manufacturing locations to our sales distribution centers are included in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of income. Shipping and handling costs incurred to move goods from our manufacturing locations or sales distribution centers to our customers are also included in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of income, except for costs incurred to distribute goods sold by our consolidated bottlers to our customers, which are included in the line item selling, general and administrative ex penses in our consolidated statement of income. Our customers generally do not pay us separately for shipping and handling costs. We recognize the cost of shipping and handling activities that are performed after a customer obtains control of the goods as costs to fulfill our promise to provide goods to the customer. As a result of this election, the Company does not evaluate whether shipping and handling activities are services promised to customers. If revenue is recognized for the related goods before the shipping and handling activities occur, the related costs of those shipping and handling activities are accrued.\n\n## Sales, Use, Value-Added and Excise Taxes\n\nThe Company collects taxes imposed directly on its customers related to sales, use, value-added, excise and other similar taxes. The Company then remits such taxes on behalf of its customers to the applicable governmental authorities. We exclude from net operating revenues the tax amounts imposed on revenue-producing transactions that were collected from our customers to be remitted to governmental authorities. Accordingly, such tax amounts are recorded in the line item trade accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheet when collection of taxes from the customer has not yet occurred and are recorded in the line item accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet until they are remitted to the applicable governmental authorities. Taxes imposed directly on the Company, whether based on receipts from sales, inventory procurement costs or manufacturing activities, are recorded in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of income.\n\n## Net Income Per Share\n\nBasic net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted net income per share is computed similarly to basic net income per share, except that it includes the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities were ex ercised. We ex cluded 3 million, 8 million and 8 million stock options from the computation of diluted net income per share in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, because the stock options would have been antidilutive.\n\n## Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents\n\nWe classify time deposits and other investments that are highly liquid and have maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase as cash equivalents or restricted cash equivalents, as applicable. Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents generally consist of amounts held by our captive insurance companies, which are included in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties and procedures to monitor our concentrations of credit risk.",

Segment Reporting\n\nWe manufacture and market primarily snack food products, including chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks, as well as gum &amp; candy, cheese &amp; grocery and powdered beverages.\n\nWe manage  our  global  business  and  report  operating  results  through  geographic  units.  We  manage  our  operations  by  region  to  lev erage  regional operating scale, manage different and changing business env ironments more effectiv ely and pursue growth opportunities as they arise across our key markets. Our regional management teams have responsibility for the business, product categories and financial results in the regions.\n\nOur operations and management structure are organized into four operating segments:\n\n- Latin America\n- AMEA\n- Europe\n- North America\n\nOur  Chief  Operating  Decision  Maker  (CODM)  is  our  Chief  Executiv e  Officer.

The CODM also uses segment operating income as an input to the ov erall compensation measures for segment management under our incentiv e compensation plans. We believ e it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help inv estors analyze segment performance and trends. Segment operating income excludes unrealized gains and losses on hedging activ ities (which are a component of cost of sales), general corporate expenses (which are a component of selling, general and administrativ e expenses), amortization of intangible assets, gains and losses on div estitures and acquisitions and acquisition-related costs (which are a component of selling, general and administrativ e expenses) in all periods presented. We exclude these items from segment operating income in order to prov ide better transparency of our segment operating results. Furthermore, we centrally manage benefit plan non-serv ice income and interest and other expense, net. We do not present these items by segment because they are excluded from the segment profitability measure that our CODM rev iews. Additionally, assets for reportable segments are not disclosed as such information is not regularly rev iewed by the Company's CODM.",

      "question": "How do KO's concerns about bisphenol A (BPA) in beverage packaging and MDLZ's compliance challenges with PFAS in packaging regulations reflect different strategic risks related to consumer perception and regulatory costs in their respective product lines?",
      "answer": "KO specifically identifies bisphenol A (BPA), a chemical used in the interior coating of beverage cans, as a substance of concern that could affect consumer preferences and lead to additional governmental regulation, potentially increasing production costs or reducing demand for its sweetened beverages. This reflects a strategic risk tied directly to consumer perception and potential reformulation or packaging redesign costs. MDLZ, on the other hand, mentions facing financial and operational risks related to complying with evolving packaging regulations, including those involving PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), which could result in higher compliance costs, capital expenditures, and production costs. While both companies face regulatory exposure in packaging, KO's risk centers on consumer trust and product formulation, whereas MDLZ's risk is more about operational compliance and legal exposure across global markets. This distinction shows how packaging regulations can affect companies differently based on their product categories and consumer engagement strategies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - KO mentions bisphenol A (BPA) in beverage packaging as a concern that could lead to regulatory action and consumer avoidance of sweetened beverages.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - MDLZ highlights PFAS in packaging as part of the regulatory risks that could increase compliance and production costs.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies face risks from packaging regulations, but the nature of those risks differs: KO faces consumer perception and demand risks, while MDLZ faces operational and legal compliance costs."

Ongoing public concern about obesity; other health-related public concerns surrounding consumption of sweetened beverages; the effects or perceived effects of the usage of weight-loss drugs on consumption patterns; potential new or increased taxes on sweetened beverages by government entities to reduce consumption or to raise revenue; potential new or increased governmental regulations on particular ingredients or additives in our beverages and packaging, or on manufacturing processes; additional governmental regulations concerning the advertising, marketing, labeling, packaging or sale of our sweetened beverages; and negative publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against us or other companies in our industry relating to the marketing, labeling or sale of sweetened beverages may reduce demand for, or increase the cost of, our sweetened beverages, which could adversely affect our profitability.\n\n## If we do not address evolving consumer product and shopping preferences, our business could suffer.\n\nConsumer product preferences have evolved and continue to evolve as a result of, among other things, health, wellness and nutrition considerations, including concerns regarding caloric intake associated with sweetened beverages and the perceived undesirability of artificial ingredients or processing; concerns regarding the perceived health effects of, or location of origin of, ingredients, raw materials or substances in our products or packaging, including due to the results of thirdparty studies (whether or not scientifically valid); shifting consumer demographics; changes in consumer tastes and needs coupled with a rapid expansion of beverage options and delivery methods; changes in consumer lifestyles; concerns regarding the environmental, social and sustainability impact of ingredient sources, the product manufacturing process and our packaging; consumer emphasis on transparency related to ingredients we use in our products and collection and recyclability of, and amount of recycled content contained in, our packaging containers and other materials; concerns about the health and welfare of animals in our dairy supply chain; and competitive product and pricing pressures. In addition, in many of our markets, shopping patterns are being affected by the digital evolution, with consumers rapidly embracing shopping by way of mobile device applications, e-commerce retailers and e-commerce websites or platforms. If we fail to address changes in consumer product and shopping preferences, do not successfully anticipate and prepare for future changes in such preferences, or are ineffective or slow in developing and implementing appropriate digital transformation initiatives, our share of sales, revenue growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected.\n\n## Product safety and quality concerns could negatively affect our business.\n\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all of our products. We have rigorous product safety and quality standards that we expect our operations, bottling partners and contract manufacturers to meet. However, despite our strong commitment to product safety and quality, we or our bottling partners at times have not met, and may not always meet, these standards, particularly as we expand our product offerings through innovation or acquisitions into beverage categories, such as value-added dairy and plant-based beverages, that are beyond our traditional range of beverage products. We and our bottling partners have had, and may in the future need, to recall products if they become contaminated or adulterated by any means, or if they are mislabeled or do not meet applicable regulatory requirements. In addition, we or our bottling partners and products have been, and could continue to be, subject to inspection by federal, state and local authorities, which could result in the identification of product quality or safety issues. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time, and could also subject us to product liability claims and negative publicity, all of which could cause our business to suffer.\n\nPublic debate and concern about perceived negative health consequences of processing and of certain ingredients, such as nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners, color additives and biotechnology-derived substances, and of other substances present in our beverage products or packaging materials, may reduce demand for our beverage products or result in additional governmental regulation.\n\nPublic debate and concern about perceived negative health consequences of processing and of certain ingredients in our beverage products, such as synthetic colors, nutritive (e.g., sugar, HFCS) and non-nutritive sweeteners, biotechnology-derived substances and other additives; substances that are present in our beverage products naturally or that occur as a result of the manufacturing process, such as 4-methylimidazole (4-MEI), a chemical compound that is formed during the manufacturing of certain types of caramel coloring used in cola-flavored beverages; or substances used in packaging materials, such as bisphenol A (BPA), an odorless, tasteless food-grade chemical commonly used in the food and beverage industries as a component in the coating of the interior of cans, may affect consumers' preferences and cause them to shift away from some of our beverage",

We compete to hire new personnel with a variety  of  capabilities  in  the  many  countries  in  which  we  manufacture  and  market  our  products  and  then  to  dev elop  and  retain  their  skills  and competencies. We have experienced and could continue to experience unplanned or increased turnov er of employees with key capabilities, and we could fail to dev elop adequate succession plans for leadership positions or hire and retain a workforce with the skills and in the locations we need to operate and grow our business. We could also fail to attract and dev elop personnel with key emerging capabilities that we need to continue to respond to changing consumer and customer needs and grow our business, including skills in the areas of adv anced technology, artificial intelligence, machine learning, digital commerce, data analytics and supply chain expertise. Occurrence of any of these conditions could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitiv eness.\n\nWe are experiencing an increasingly tight and competitiv e labor market and could face unforeseen challenges in the av ailability of labor. A sustained labor  shortage  or  increased  turnov er  rates  within  our  employee  base  as  a  result  of  general  macroeconomic  factors  (including  high  inflation  and hyperinflation in certain markets), hav e led and in the future could continue to lead to increased costs, such as increased ov ertime to meet demand and increased wages to attract and retain employees. We hav e also been negativ ely affected and could continue to be negativ ely affected by labor shortages or constraints experienced by our partners, including our external manufacturing partners, freight prov iders, other strategic suppliers and distributors.

This includes our management of employees represented by labor unions or workers' councils, who represent approximately 60% of our 78,000 employees outside the United States and approximately 20% of our 12,000 U.S. employees. Strikes, work stoppages or other forms of labor unrest by our employees or those of our suppliers, distributors or other business partners, or situations like the renegotiation of collectiv e bargaining agreements,  hav e  in  the  past  and  may  in  the  future  cause  disruptions  to  our  supply  chain,  manufacturing  or  distribution  processes.  Changes  in immigration laws and policies or restrictions could make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate skilled employees. We could also fail to effectiv ely respond to ev olv ing perceptions and goals of those in our workforce or whom we might seek to hire with respect to flexible working or other matters. These risks could materially and adv ersely affect our reputation, ability to efficiently operate our manufacturing facilities and ov erall business and meet the needs of our customers, product sales, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Risks\n\nWe face risks  related  to  complying  with  changes  in  and  inconsistencies  among  laws  and  regulations  in  many  countries  in  which  we operate.\n\nOur activ ities around the world are highly regulated and subject to gov ernment ov ersight. Various laws and regulations gov ern food production, sourcing, packaging and waste management (including packaging containing PFAS), storage, distribution, sales, adv ertising, labeling and marketing, as well as intellectual property, competition, antitrust, trade and export controls, labor, tax, social and env ironmental matters, priv acy, data protection, and health and  safety  practices.  Gov ernment  authorities  regularly  change  laws  and  regulations,  their  interpretations  of  existing  laws  and  regulations,  and  their enforcement priorities. Our failure to comply with existing laws and regulations (or allegations thereof), or to make changes necessary to comply with new or revised laws and regulations or ev olv ing  interpretations  and  application  of  existing  laws  and  regulations,  and  differing  or  competing  laws  and regulations  across  the  markets  where  our  products  are  made,  manufactured,  distributed  and  sold,  could  materially  and  adv ersely  affect  our  product sales, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including as a result of higher compliance costs, higher capital expenditures and higher production costs. For instance, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negativ ely affected by the regulatory and economic impact of changes in the corporate tax policies of the United States and other countries; tariff policies and trade relations among the United States and other  countries,  including  China,  Mexico,  Canada  and  the  European  Union;  and  changes  within  the  European  Union.

      "answer": "KO explicitly uses a portion of its foreign currency denominated debt, a non-derivative financial instrument, as part of its strategy to hedge net investments in foreign operations. Changes in the carrying values of these instruments due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations are recorded in net foreign currency translation adjustments within AOCI. In contrast, COST does not mention using foreign currency denominated debt for hedging foreign investments. Instead, COST's disclosures focus on short-term investments in U.S. Government and Agency Notes, with an emphasis on fair value measurement and credit risk evaluation, but not on foreign exchange risk management through non-derivative instruments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From KO's 10-K, identify that the company uses foreign currency denominated debt as a non-derivative financial instrument to hedge net investments in foreign operations.",

Included in accounts payable at the end of 2022 and 2021, are $995 and $999 representing the excess of outstanding payments over cash on deposit at the banks on which the payments were drawn.\n\n## Short-Term Investments\n\nShort-term investments generally consist of debt securities (U.S. Government and Agency Notes), with maturities at the date of purchase of three months to five years. Investments with maturities beyond five years may be classified, based on the Company's determination, as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because they represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. Short-term investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded  at  fair  value  using  the  specific  identification  method  with  the  unrealized  gains  and  losses  reflected  in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-forsale securities, if any, are determined on a specific identification basis and are recorded in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income. These available-for-sale investments have a low level of inherent credit risk given they are issued by the U.S. Government and Agencies. Changes in their fair value are primarily attributable to  changes  in  interest  rates  and  market  liquidity.  Short-term  investments  classified  as  held-to-maturity  are  financial instruments  that  the  Company  has  the  intent  and  ability  to  hold  to  maturity  and  are  reported  net  of  any  related amortization and are not remeasured to fair value on a recurring basis.\n\nThe Company periodically evaluates unrealized losses in  its  investment  securities  for  credit  impairment,  using  both qualitative and quantitative criteria. In the event a security is deemed to be impaired as the result of a credit loss, the Company recognizes the loss in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nThe Company accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The carrying value of the Company's financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to their  short-term  nature  or  variable  interest  rates.  See  Notes  2,  3,  and  4  for  the  carrying  value  and  fair  value  of  the Company's investments, derivative instruments, and fixed-rate debt, respectively.\n\nFair  value  is  defined  as  the  price  that  would  be  received  to  sell  an  asset  or  paid  to  transfer  a  liability  in  an  orderly transaction  between  market  participants  at  the  measurement  date.  Fair  value  is  estimated  by  applying  a  fair  value hierarchy, which requires maximizing the use of observable inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of inputs are:\n\n- Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n- Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.\n- Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.\n\nThe  Company's  valuation  techniques  used  to  measure  the  fair  value  of  money  market  mutual  funds  are  based  on quoted  market  prices,  such  as  quoted  net  asset  values  published  by  the  fund  as  supported  in  an  active  market. Valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of all other non-derivative financial instruments are based on independent  external  valuation  information.  The  pricing  process  uses  data  from  a  variety  of  independent  external valuation  information  providers,  including  trades,  bid  price  or  spread,  two-sided  markets,  quotes,  benchmark  curves including but not limited to treasury benchmarks and LIBOR or Secured Overnight Financing Rate and swap curves, discount  rates,  and  market  data  feeds.  All  are  observable  in  the  market  or  can  be  derived  principally  from  or corroborated by observable market data.

Insurance coverage is maintained for certain risks to limit exposures arising from very large losses. The Company uses different  risk  management  mechanisms,  including  a  wholly-owned  captive  insurance  subsidiary  (the  captive)  and participates in a reinsurance program. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted  and  are  estimated,  in  part,  by  considering  historical  claims  experience,  demographic  factors,  severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends.

The participant agreements and practices of the reinsurance program are designed to limit a participating members' individual risk. Income statement adjustments related to the reinsurance program and related impacts to the consolidated balance sheets are recognized as information becomes known. In the event the Company leaves the reinsurance program, the Company retains its primary obligation to the policyholders for prior activity.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nThe Company is exposed to foreign-currency exchange-rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. It manages these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact  of  fluctuations  of  foreign  exchange  on  known  future  expenditures  denominated  in  a  non-functional  foreigncurrency. The  contracts  relate  primarily  to  U.S.  dollar  merchandise  inventory  expenditures  made  by  the  Company's international subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for  derivative  hedge  accounting. The  Company  seeks  to  mitigate  risk  with  the  use  of  these  contracts  and  does  not intend to engage in speculative transactions. Some of these contracts contain credit-risk-related contingent features that require settlement of outstanding contracts upon certain triggering events. The aggregate fair value amounts of derivative  instruments  in  a  net  liability  position  and  the  amount  needed  to  settle  the  instruments  immediately  if  the credit-risk-related  contingent  features  were  triggered  were  immaterial  at  the  end  of  2022.  There  were  no  derivative instruments in a net liability position at the end of 2021. The aggregate notional amounts of open, unsettled forward foreign-exchange  contracts  were  $1,242  and  $1,331  at  the  end  of  2022  and  2021,  respectively.

In contrast, KO experienced a 2% increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in 2021, which flowed into 2022 operations, but there is no indication KO used hedging mechanisms like COST.

This increase was primarily due to higher annual incentive and stock-based compensation expense, increased charitable donations and increased marketing spending, which was reduced in 2020 as a result of uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in annual incentive and stock-based compensation expense was primarily due to improved financial performance in 2021 and a more favorable outlook of our future financial performance, which resulted in higher payout assumptions as compared to 2020. In 2021, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations increased selling, general and administrative expenses by 2 percent.\n\nThe decrease in selling and distribution expenses was primarily due to the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on awayfrom-home channels, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $335 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock-based compensation awards granted under our plans, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years as stockbased compensation expense.

In contrast, Coca-Cola enters into license agreements to expand its beverage offerings and manage concentrate revenue recognition. For Coca-Cola, the timing of revenue recognition differs depending on whether the concentrate is sold to consolidated or unconsolidated bottling partners, with revenue recognized immediately for unconsolidated partners but deferred until resale for consolidated ones. These distinct uses of licensing directly shape Costco\u2019s margin-focused private-label strategy and Coca-Cola\u2019s concentrate distribution and revenue timing model.",

We compete on a worldwide basis with global, national, and regional  wholesalers  and  retailers,  including  supermarkets,  supercenters,  internet  retailers,  gasoline  stations,  hard discounters, department and specialty stores, and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise. Walmart, Target, Kroger, and Amazon are among our significant general merchandise retail competitors in the U.S. We also compete with other warehouse clubs, including Walmart's Sam's Club and BJ's Wholesale Club. Many of the major metropolitan areas in the U.S. and certain of our Other International locations have multiple competing clubs.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nWe believe that, to varying degrees, our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, proprietary processes, trade secrets, trade dress, domain names and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important to our success. We have invested significantly in the development and protection of our well-recognized brands, including the Costco Wholesale trademarks and our private-label brand, Kirkland Signature. We believe that Kirkland Signature products  are  high  quality,  offered  at  prices  that  are  generally  lower  than  national  brands,  and  help  lower  costs, differentiate our merchandise offerings, and generally earn higher margins. We expect to continue to increase the sales penetration of our private-label items.\n\nWe rely on trademark and copyright laws, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality, license and other agreements with our suppliers, employees and others to protect our intellectual property. The availability and duration of trademark registrations vary by country; however, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and registrations are maintained.\n\n## Available Information\n\nOur U.S. website is www.costco.com.

The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report filed with or furnished to the SEC. The SEC maintains a site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, such as the Company, that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov.\n\nWe have a code of ethics for senior financial officers, pursuant to Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Copies of the code are available free of charge by writing to Secretary, Costco Wholesale Corporation, 999 Lake Drive, Issaquah, WA 98027. If the Company makes any amendments to this code (other than technical, administrative, or non-substantive amendments) or grants any waivers, including implicit waivers, to the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or principal accounting officer and controller, we will disclose (on our website or in a Form 8-K report filed with the SEC) the nature of the amendment or waiver, its effective date, and to whom it applies.",

          "chunk_text": "differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year and for the manner in which the differences are expected to reverse. Based on the evaluation of all available information, the Company recognizes future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not.\n\nWe evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results; the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences; taxable income in prior carryback years (if permitted); and the availability of tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is required to be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that the Company will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset.\n\nThe Company does not record a U.S. deferred tax liability for the excess of the book basis over the tax basis of its investments in foreign subsidiaries to the extent that the basis difference meets the indefinite reversal criteria. These criteria are met if the foreign subsidiary has invested, or will invest, the undistributed earnings indefinitely. The decision as to the amount of undistributed earnings that the Company intends to maintain in non-U.S. subsidiaries takes into account items including, but not limited to, forecasts and budgets of financial needs of cash for working capital, liquidity plans, capital improvement programs, merger and acquisition plans, and planned loans to other non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company also evaluates its expected cash requirements in the United States. Other factors that can influence that determination are local restrictions on remittances (for example, in some countries a central bank application and approval are required in order for the Company's local country subsidiary to pay a dividend), economic stability and asset risk. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Operations Review\n\nOur organizational structure consists of the following operating segments: Europe, Middle East and Africa; Latin America; North America; Asia Pacific; Global Ventures; and Bottling Investments. Our operating structure also includes Corporate, which consists of a center and a platform services organization. For additional information regarding our operating segments and Corporate, refer to Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands\n\nIn order to continually improve upon the Company's operating performance, from time to time, we engage in buying and selling ownership interests in bottling partners and other manufacturing operations. In addition, we also acquire brands and their related operations or enter into license agreements for certain brands to supplement our beverage offerings. These items impact our operating results and certain key metrics used by management in assessing the Company's performance.\n\nUnit case volume growth is a metric used by management to evaluate the Company's performance because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. The Company's unit case volume represents the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers and, therefore, reflects unit case volume for both consolidated and unconsolidated bottlers. Refer to the heading 'Beverage Volume' below.\n\nConcentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished products sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, concentrate sales volume represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents), sold by the Company to customers or consumers. Refer to the heading 'Beverage Volume' below.\n\nWhen we analyze our net operating revenues, we generally consider the following factors: (1) volume growth (concentrate sales volume or unit case volume, as applicable); (2) changes in price, product and geographic mix; (3) foreign currency fluctuations; and (4) acquisitions and divestitures (including structural changes defined below), as applicable. Refer to the heading 'Net Operating Revenues' below. The Company sells concentrates and syrups to both consolidated and unconsolidated bottling partners. The ownership structure of our bottling partners impacts the timing of recognizing concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our consolidated bottling partners, we do not recognize the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume until the bottling partner has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our unconsolidated bottling partners, we recognize the concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume when the concentrates or syrups are sold to the bottling partner. The subsequent sale of the finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party does not impact the timing of recognizing the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume. When we account for an unconsolidated bottling partner as an equity method investment, we eliminate the intercompany profit related to these transactions to the extent of our ownership interest until the equity method investee has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to",

In contrast, PM outlines specific sustainability programs across its business units aimed at meeting environmental compliance requirements while reducing carbon footprint, wastage, and water and energy consumption. These programs involve costs that could impact financial performance, and PM actively reports its climate change mitigation strategy through CDP, indicating a structured but potentially costly approach.

In 2024, sales to a distributor in the Europe Region and a distributor in the EA, AU &amp; PMI DF Region each amounted to 10 percent or more of our consolidated net revenues. See Item 8, Note 13. Segment Reporting for more information. We believe that none of our business segments is dependent upon a single customer or a few customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. In some of our markets, particularly in the Europe, SSEA, CIS &amp; MEA, and EA, AU &amp; PMI DF Regions, a loss of a distributor may result in a temporary market disruption.\n\n## Human Capital\n\nOur Workforce . At December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 83,100 people worldwide, including full-time, temporary and part-time staff. Our businesses are subject to a number of laws and regulations relating to our relationship with our employees. G enerally, these laws and regulations are specific to the location of each business. We engage with legally recognized employee representative bodies and we have collective bargaining agreements in several of the countries in which we operate. In addition, in accordance with E.U. requirements, we have established a European Works Council composed of management and elected members of our workforce. We believe we maintain good relations with our employees and their representative organizations.\n\nOur Internal Transformation. To be successful in our transformation to a smoke-free future, we must continue transforming our culture and ways of working, align our talent with our business needs, successfully integrate acquired businesses and innovate to become a truly consumer-centric business. To achieve our strategic goals, we need to attract, retain, develop and motivate the best global talent, talent that is diverse and has the right degree of ex perience, competencies and skills. Our compensation and benefit programs are set at the levels that we believe are necessary to attract the best talent and remain competitive with other consumer product companies.\n\nOversight and Management.  Our  Board  of  Directors  (the  \"Board\")  provides  oversight  of  various  matters  pertaining  to  our  workforce.  The  Compensation  and Leadership Development Committee of the Board is responsible for executive compensation matters and oversight of the risks and programs related to human capital management. Our Code of Conduct and Corporate Governance Guidelines highlight our commitment to ethical business conduct and honesty, respect, and fairness.\n\nCollaborative Culture. We are proud of the global reach of our company, which operates in approximately 170 markets with employees representing more than 130 nationalities. We reflect the demographics of the countries, communities, and consumers we serve, which is key to the variety of thought, innovation, and consumercentric approach that enables us to deliver a smoke-free future.\n\nOur focus is on fostering a performance-driven and collaborative culture, recognizing the value of our global workforce and their contributions. We remain committed to  the  impact,  growth,  and  well-being  of  our  employees,  providing  them  with  the  right  environment,  support,  and  resources  for  their  careers  and  professional development.\n\nThese principles are codified in our cultural values, which we call the PMI DNA, and we embed these principles throughout our people and business guidelines, practices, and systems.\n\nAs the first multinational company to receive a global EQUAL-SALARY certification from the EQUAL-SALARY Foundation in 2019, we completed another year of market level reviews with success and maintained our global certification. We believe this certification is a valuable component in our reputation as an employer.\n\n## Government Regulation\n\nAs a company with global operations in a heavily regulated industry, we are subject to multiple laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We discuss our regulatory environment in Item 7, Business Environment .\n\nThe regulatory landscape related to sustainability matters is rapidly evolving. We closely monitor these developments and implement initiatives addressing PMI's priorities in line with our sustainability strategy. In particular, we are subject to international, national and local environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business. We have specific programs across our business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements and reduce our carbon footprint, wastage, as well as water and energy consumption. We report externally about our climate change mitigation strategy, together with associated targets and results in reducing our carbon footprint, through CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project), the leading international non-governmental organization assessing the work of thousands of companies worldwide in the area of environmental impact, including climate change.",

      "answer": "PEP indicated that its long-term debt financing, along with cash from operations and commercial paper, supports its net capital spending plans, which include funding for the transition tax liability of $1.7 billion under the TCJ Act, with $772 million expected to be paid in 2025. In contrast, PM reported higher repayments on long-term debt in 2024, contributing to an increase in net cash used in financing activities by $3.9 billion compared to 2023. Despite this, PM plans to spend approximately $1.5 billion on capital expenditures in 2025, primarily for ZYN capacity expansion in the U.S. This reflects that while both companies utilize long-term debt financing, PEP is leveraging it more for tax liabilities and general capital spending, whereas PM is managing higher debt repayments while still investing in smoke-free product manufacturing.",

This decrease in net cash used was primarily due to the remaining cash payment (including interest) to Altria G roup, Inc. in July 2023 of $1.8 billion for PMI to reacquire the IQOS commercialization rights in the U.S., and higher cash collateral received for derivative instruments, partially offset by higher capital ex penditures.\n\nOur capital expenditures were $1.4 billion in 2024 and $1.3 billion in 2023. The 2024 expenditures were primarily related to our ongoing investments in smoke-free product manufacturing capacity. We expect total capital expenditures in 2025 of approximately $1.5 billion, including further investments in ZYN capacity in the U.S.\n\n## \u0000 Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\n\nNet cash used in financing activities of $9.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased by $3.9 billion from the comparable 2023 period. The increase in net  cash  used  was  primarily  due  to  lower  net  borrowings  in  2024,  reflecting  higher  repayments  on  long-term  debt,  lower  long-term  debt  proceeds  and  higher repayments on short-term borrowings (primarily commercial paper). The increase was partly offset by favorable comparisons to 2023 mainly reflecting repayment on a credit facility in 2023 related to the Swedish Match acquisition, and payments in 2023 to acquire the remaining issued and outstanding shares in Swedish Match, as well as higher cash collateral received for derivative instruments.\n\nDividends paid in 2024 and 2023 were $8.2 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively.\n\n## 2023 compared with 2022\n\nFor a discussion comparing our net cash activities (operating, investing and financing) for the year ended December 31, 2023, with the year ended December 31, 2022, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Financial Review in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 8, 2024. This section is incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\n## \u00b7 Debt and Liquidity\n\nWe define cash and cash equivalents as short-term, highly liquid investments, readily convertible to known amounts of cash that mature within a maximum of three months and have an insignificant risk of change in value due to interest rate or credit risk changes. As a policy, we do not hold any investments in structured or equity-linked products. Our cash and cash equivalents are mostly held with institutions that have investment-grade long-term credit rating.\n\nIn a number of jurisdictions, including Argentina and Russia, we are impacted by various capital controls and/or foreign currency exchange constraints that affect the ability of our subsidiaries in these jurisdictions to settle foreign currency denominated imports of goods and services and/or to pay dividends. These factors increase foreign currency devaluation risks, which may have a negative impact on our financial condition, net assets and results of operations in these jurisdictions.\n\nWe utilize long-term and short-term debt financing, including a commercial paper program that is regularly used to finance ongoing liquidity requirements, as part of our overall cash management strategy. Our ability to access the capital and credit markets as well as overall dynamics of these markets may impact borrowing costs. We expect that the combination of our long-term and short-term debt financing, the commercial paper program and the committed credit facilities, coupled with our operating cash flows, will enable us to meet our liquidity requirements.\n\nCredit Ratings -The cost and terms of our financing arrangements as well as our access to commercial paper markets may be affected by applicable credit ratings. At February 6, 2025, our credit ratings and outlook by major credit rating agencies were as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "What is the difference in the way Coca-Cola (KO) and PepsiCo (PEP) handle the Schweppes brand in terms of ownership and licensing, and how does this affect their respective gross margins in sparkling beverage segments?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola owns the Schweppes brand in certain countries outside the United States, which is part of its owned sparkling soft drink portfolio that generates higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins due to finished product operations. In contrast, PepsiCo manufactures and distributes Schweppes under a licensing agreement with Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., which falls under its licensed brand portfolio within PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA). Licensed brands like Schweppes are integrated into PepsiCo's beverage operations, which include both concentrate and finished goods sales. Since finished product operations (like those at Coca-Cola for Schweppes in certain markets) generally yield higher revenues but lower margins compared to concentrate operations, and PepsiCo\u2019s licensed brand distribution likely involves lower capital investment and different margin structures, the structural handling of Schweppes contributes to differing gross margin profiles in their sparkling beverage segments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Coca-Cola owns Schweppes in certain countries outside the U.S., and finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins.",

      "question": "Given that Coca-Cola (KO) has distribution coordination agreements with Monster Beverage Corporation, while PepsiCo (PEP) competes directly with both Monster and KO in the U.S. liquid refreshment beverage category, how does the competitive landscape influence the respective geographic coverage and bottling partner strategies of KO and PEP, especially considering KO's involvement with Monster and PEP's 14% consolidated net revenue dependence on Walmart?",
      "answer": "KO leverages its bottling partner network to distribute Monster Beverage products under distribution coordination agreements, extending its reach in the energy drink segment. This strategic alignment allows KO to integrate Monster into its existing geographic operating segments, enhancing distribution efficiency and consumer access. In contrast, PEP, which competes with both KO and Monster, relies heavily on major retail relationships like Walmart\u2014accounting for 14% of its consolidated net revenue\u2014to maintain competitive shelf space and distribution dominance. While KO strengthens its beverage portfolio through Monster's distribution, PEP prioritizes securing prime retail placement to counter competitive pressures, highlighting how the competitive landscape shapes KO's partnership-driven geographic expansion and PEP's retail-centric bottling and distribution strategy.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from KO_10k_2023.pdf: KO has distribution coordination agreements with Monster Beverage Corporation, allowing Coca-Cola system bottlers to distribute Monster products in designated territories in the U.S., Canada, and other international markets.",
        "Step 2: Extract from KO_10k_2023.pdf: KO integrates Monster into its geographic operating segments through its bottling partner network, which is central to its finished product and concentrate operations.",
        "Step 3: Extract from PEP_10k_2023.pdf: PepsiCo competes with Monster Beverage Corporation and KO in the U.S. liquid refreshment beverage category, where KO and PEP held approximately 20% and 19% market share, respectively, in 2023.",
        "Step 4: Extract from PEP_10k_2023.pdf: Walmart and its affiliates accounted for 14% of PepsiCo\u2019s consolidated net revenue in 2023, underscoring the strategic importance of major retail customers in maintaining distribution strength.",
        "Step 5: Synthesize: KO expands its beverage reach through strategic Monster partnerships across its bottling network, while PEP counters competitive threats by leveraging dominant retail channels like Walmart to secure distribution and market share, illustrating a divergence in distribution strategies shaped by competitive positioning."

      "answer": "Heineken N.V. is identified in The Coca-Cola Company's 2024 10-K as a competitor in the alcohol beverage category, indicating its strong presence in the ready-to-drink alcohol market. Additionally, Philip Morris International (PMI) includes Heineken N.V. in its peer group, which consists of global consumer product companies with similar revenue and market capitalization. This dual appearance highlights Heineken N.V.'s competitive stature as a multinational consumer goods company, operating at a scale comparable not only to beverage peers but also to major global consumer staples firms across sectors. This reflects Heineken\u2019s strong international brand presence, diversified market operations, and relevance in benchmarking exercises across industries.",

          "chunk_text": "## Promotional and Marketing Programs\n\nIn addition to conducting our own independent advertising and marketing activities, we may provide promotional and marketing support and/or funds to our bottlers. In most cases, we do this on a discretionary basis under the terms of commitment letters or agreements, even though we are not obligated to do so under the terms of the bottler's agreements between our Company and the bottlers. Also, on a discretionary basis in most cases, our Company may develop and introduce new products, packages and equipment to assist the bottlers. Likewise, in many instances, we provide promotional and marketing support and/or funds and/or dispensing equipment and repair services to fountain and bottle/can retailers, typically pursuant to marketing agreements.\n\n## Investments in Bottling Operations\n\nMost of our branded beverage products are prepared, packaged, distributed and sold by independent bottling partners. However, from time to time we acquire or take control of a bottling operation, often in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance. Owning a bottling operation enables us to compensate for limited local resources; help focus the bottler's sales and marketing programs; assist in the development of the bottler's business and information systems; and establish an appropriate capital structure for the bottler. In line with our long-term bottling strategy, we may periodically consider options for divesting or reducing our ownership interest in a consolidated bottling operation, typically by selling all or a portion of our interest in the bottling operation to an independent bottler to improve Coca-Cola system efficiency. When we sell a consolidated bottling operation to an independent bottling partner in which we have an equity method investment, our Company continues to participate in the bottler's results of operations through our share of the equity method investee's earnings or losses.\n\nIn addition, from time to time we make equity investments representing noncontrolling interests in certain bottling operations with the intention of maximizing the strength and efficiency of the Coca-Cola system's production, marketing, sales and distribution capabilities around the world by providing expertise and resources to strengthen those businesses. These investments are intended to result in increases in unit case volume, net operating revenues and profits at the bottler level, which in turn generate increased sales for our Company's concentrate operations. When our equity investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee bottler's operating and financial policies, we account for the investment under the equity method.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nSales of our ready-to-drink beverages are somewhat seasonal, with the second and third calendar quarters historically accounting for the highest sales volumes. The volume of sales in the beverage business may be affected by weather conditions.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe commercial beverage industry is highly competitive and consists of numerous companies, ranging from small or emerging to very large and well established. These include companies that, like our Company, compete globally in multiple geographic areas, as well as businesses that are primarily regional or local in operation. Competitive products include numerous nonalcoholic sparkling soft drinks; water products, including flavored and enhanced waters; juices, juice drinks and nectars; dilutables (including syrups and powders); coffees; teas; energy drinks; sports drinks; milk and other dairy-based drinks; plant-based beverages; functional beverages, including vitamin-based products and relaxation beverages; and various other nonalcoholic beverages. These competitive products are sold to consumers in both ready-to-drink and non-ready-to-drink form. The Company has directly entered the alcohol beverage category in numerous markets outside the United States. In the United States, the Company has established a wholly owned, indirect, firewalled subsidiary, which uses third-party manufacturers and distributors to produce and sell alcohol products in certain regions of the United States and also authorizes alcohol-licensed third parties to use certain of our trademarks and related intellectual property on alcohol beverages that contain Company beverage bases. Competitive products include all alcohol ready-to-drink beverages containing various alcohol bases. In many of the countries in which we do business, PepsiCo, Inc. is a primary competitor. Other significant competitors include, but are not limited to, Nestl\u00e9 S.A., Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., Danone S.A., Suntory Beverage &amp; Food Limited, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Kirin Holdings, Heineken N.V., Diageo plc and Red Bull GmbH. We also compete against numerous regional and local companies and, increasingly, against smaller companies that are developing microbrands and selling them directly to consumers through e-commerce retailers and other e-commerce platforms. In addition, in some markets, we compete against retailers that have developed their own store or private-label beverage brands.\n\nCompetitive factors impacting our business include, but are not limited to, pricing, advertising, sales promotion programs,     in-store displays and point-of-sale marketing, digital marketing, product and ingredient innovation, availability, increased efficiency in production techniques, the introduction of new packaging as well as new vending and dispensing equipment, contracting with marketing assets (theaters, sports arenas, universities, etc.), and brand and trademark development and protection.",

For our Company, the only assets and liabilities that are adjusted to fair value on a recurring basis are investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values, debt securities classified as trading or available-for-sale, derivative financial instruments and our contingent consideration liability. Additionally, the Company adjusts the carrying value of certain long-term debt as a result of the Company's fair value hedging strategy.\n\n## Investments in Debt and Equity Securities\n\nThe fair values of our investments in debt and equity securities using quoted market prices from daily exchange traded markets are based on the closing price as of the balance sheet date and are classified as Level 1. The fair values of our investments in debt and equity securities classified as Level 2 are priced using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. Inputs into these valuation techniques include actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes and other similar data. These inputs are obtained from quoted market prices, independent pricing vendors or other sources.\n\n## Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nThe fair values of our futures contracts are primarily determined using quoted contract prices on futures exchange markets. The fair values of these instruments are based on the closing contract prices as of the balance sheet date and are classified as Level 1.\n\nThe fair values of our derivative instruments other than futures are determined using standard valuation models. The significant inputs used in these models are readily available in public markets, or can be derived from observable market transactions, and therefore have been classified as Level 2. Inputs used in these standard valuation models for derivative instruments other than futures include the applicable exchange rates, forward rates, interest rates, discount rates and commodity prices. The standard valuation model for options also uses implied volatility as an additional input. The discount rates are based on the historical U.S. Deposit or U.S. Treasury rates, and the implied volatility specific to options is based on quoted rates from financial institutions.\n\nIncluded in the fair values of derivative instruments is an adjustment for nonperformance risk. The adjustment is based on current credit default swap ('CDS') rates applied to each contract, by counterparty. We use our counterparty's CDS rate when we are in an asset position and our own CDS rate when we are in a liability position. The adjustment for nonperformance risk did not have a significant impact on the estimated fair values of our derivative instruments.\n\nThe following tables summarize those assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in millions):\n\n8\n\n8\n\n",

      "answer": "The total notional value of foreign currency derivatives designated in KO's cash flow hedging program as of December 31, 2024, is $9,206 million. KO uses foreign currency options and collars, primarily in euro, British pound, and Japanese yen, as part of its hedging strategy. In comparison, PM values its foreign currency options using a Black-Scholes methodology, which relies on foreign exchange rates, volatility, and maturity dates. This shows that while both companies utilize foreign currency options, KO focuses on the notional value and hedging purpose, whereas PM emphasizes the valuation methodology.",

          "chunk_text": "## Credit Risk Associated with Derivatives\n\nWe have established strict counterparty credit guidelines and enter into transactions only with financial institutions of investment grade or better. We monitor counterparty exposures regularly and review any downgrade in credit rating immediately. If a downgrade in the credit rating of a counterparty were to occur, we have provisions requiring collateral for substantially all of our transactions. To mitigate presettlement risk, minimum credit standards become more stringent as the duration of the derivative financial instrument increases. In addition, the Company's master netting agreements reduce credit risk by permitting the Company to net settle for transactions with the same counterparty. To minimize the concentration of credit risk, we enter into derivative transactions with a portfolio of financial institutions. Furthermore, for certain derivative financial instruments, the Company has agreements with counterparties that require collateral to be exchanged based on changes in the fair value of the instruments. The Company classifies collateral payments and receipts as investing cash flows when the collateral account is in an asset position and as financing cash flows when the collateral account is in a liability position. As a result of these factors, we consider the risk of counterparty default to be minimal.\n\n## Cash Flow Hedging Strategy\n\nThe Company uses cash flow hedges to minimize the variability in cash flows of assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices or interest rates. The changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into the line item in our consolidated statement of income in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. The changes in fair values of hedges that are determined to be ineffective are immediately reclassified from AOCI into earnings. The maximum length of time for which the Company hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is typically three years.\n\nThe Company maintains a foreign currency cash flow hedging program to reduce the risk that our U.S. dollar net cash inflows from sales outside the United States and U.S. dollar net cash outflows from procurement activities will be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into forward contracts and purchase foreign currency options and collars (principally euro, British pound and Japanese yen) to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against the foreign currencies, the decline in the present value of future foreign currency cash flows is partially offset by gains in the fair value of the derivative instruments. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens, the increase in the present value of future foreign currency cash flows is partially offset by losses in the fair value of the derivative instruments. The total notional values of derivatives that were designated and qualified for the Company's foreign currency cash flow hedging program were $9,206 million and $9,408 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nThe Company uses cross-currency swaps to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain of its foreign currency denominated debt and other monetary assets or liabilities due to fluctuations in foreign currency ex change rates. For this hedging program, the Company recognizes in earnings each period the changes in carrying values of these foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in exchange rates. The changes in fair values of the cross-currency swap derivatives are recorded in AOCI with an immediate reclassification into earnings for the changes in fair values attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The total notional values of derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedges for the Company's foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities were $557 million and $958 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nThe Company has entered into commodity futures contracts and other derivative instruments on various commodities to mitigate the price risk associated with forecasted purchases of materials used in our manufacturing process. These derivative instruments were designated as part of the Company's commodity cash flow hedging program.

      "answer": "In 2023, MDLZ's ownership in Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (KDP) fell below 5%, which triggered a change in accounting treatment from equity method investment to marketable securities, as MDLZ no longer had significant influence over KDP. This resulted in the remaining shares being measured at fair value with changes recognized in earnings. During 2023, MDLZ sold approximately 76 million shares of KDP and received proceeds of $2.4 billion, recording a pre-tax gain on equity method transactions of $493 million. This contrasts with KO's position, where Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. is listed as a significant competitor in the U.S. and globally, competing across multiple beverage categories including sparkling soft drinks, water products, and ready-to-drink coffee. KO emphasizes competition through pricing, innovation, and marketing, while MDLZ transitioned from a strategic equity partner to a passive investor before fully exiting the investment.",

      "answer": "Decreased agricultural productivity due to climate change impacts both Coca-Cola and Mondelez by limiting the availability and increasing the cost of key raw materials. For Coca-Cola, changing weather patterns affect the supply of agricultural commodities such as sugarcane, corn, sugar beets, citrus, coffee, and tea, which are essential ingredients in their beverage products. This could hinder their ability to source raw materials and affect product affordability. For Mondelez, climate change has already led to a global decrease in the availability and an increase in the price of cocoa, a critical raw material for their chocolate and biscuit portfolios. Both companies face increased costs and potential reputational damage due to supply chain disruptions and the need to implement sustainability initiatives to mitigate these risks.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Coca-Cola relies on agricultural commodities such as sugarcane, corn, sugar beets, citrus, coffee, and tea, and decreased agricultural productivity due to climate change may limit availability and increase costs.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Mondelez has experienced a global decrease in cocoa availability and an increase in price, directly impacting their chocolate and biscuit product lines.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are negatively impacted by decreased agricultural productivity caused by climate change, with specific risks tied to raw material availability and cost increases, leading to potential operational and reputational risks."

The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits recorded as components of other comprehensive earnings (losses) are subsequently amortized into net periodic benefit cost in future years.\n\n- Environmental Costs: Altria is subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Altria provides for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations on an undiscounted basis when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Such accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change.\n\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations, including the payment of any remediation and compliance costs or damages and the making of related expenditures, has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on Altria's consolidated results of operations, capital expenditures, financial position or cash flows. See Note 18. Contingencies -Environmental Regulation .\n\n- Fair Value Measurements: Altria measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Altria uses a fair value hierarchy, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are:\n- Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n- Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n- Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\n- Guarantees: Altria recognizes a liability for the fair value of the obligation of qualifying guarantee activities. See Note 18 . Contingencies for a further discussion of guarantees.\n- Income Taxes: Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Altria records a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Altria determines the realizability of deferred tax assets based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence. In reaching this determination, Altria considers the character of the assets and the possible sources of taxable income of the appropriate character within the available carryback and carryforward periods available under the tax law.\n\nAltria recognizes the financial statement benefit for uncertain income tax positions when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Altria recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes in its consolidated statements of earnings (losses).\n\n- Inventories: The last-in, first-out ('LIFO') method is used to determine the cost of substantially all tobacco inventories. The cost of the remaining inventories is determined using the first-in, first-out ('FIFO') and average cost methods. Inventories that are measured using the LIFO method are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventories that are measured using the FIFO and average cost methods are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. It is a generally recognized industry practice to classify leaf tobacco and wine inventories as current assets although part of such inventory, because of the duration of the curing and aging process, ordinarily would not be used within one year. The cost of approximately 81% and 59% of inventories at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, was determined using the LIFO method. The increase in LIFO percentage was due to the Ste. Michelle Transaction (as Ste. Michelle accounted for its inventory using FIFO). The stated LIFO amounts of inventories were approximately $0.6 billion lower than the current cost of inventories at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n- Investments in Equity Securities: Investments in equity securities in which Altria has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting or the fair value option. The election of the fair value option is irrevocable and is made on an investment by investment basis.\n\nAltria elected to account for its investments in ABI and Cronos under the equity method of accounting. Altria's share of equity (income) losses and other adjustments associated with these equity investments are included in (income) losses from equity investments in the consolidated statements of earnings (losses). The carrying value for each of Altria's equity investments in ABI and Cronos is reported in",

          "chunk_text": "## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nOur  consolidated  financial  statements  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  GAAP,  which  requires  us  to  make  estimates  and  apply judgments that  affect  the  reported  amounts.  In  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  we  describe  the  significant accounting  policies  used  in  preparing  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  Our  management  has  discussed  the  development, selection,  and  disclosure  of  our  critical  accounting  estimates  with  the  Audit  &amp;  Risk  Committee  of  our  Board  of  Directors.  The following items require significant estimation or judgment:\n\nInventory and cost of sales: The vast majority of our inventory is accounted for under the retail inventory accounting method using the last-in, first-out method (LIFO). Our inventory is valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market. We reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by physical inventory counts. Historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable. Market adjustments for markdowns are  recorded  when  the  salability  of  the  merchandise  has  diminished.  Salability  can  be  impacted  by  consumer  preferences  and seasonality, among other factors. We believe the risk of inventory obsolescence is largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns  in  less  than  three  months.  Inventory  was  $13.9  billion  and  $10.7  billion  as  of  January  29,  2022,  and  January  30,  2021, respectively, and is further described in Note 10 to the Financial Statements.\n\nVendor income: We  receive various forms of consideration from our vendors (vendor income), principally earned as a result of volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions, and advertising allowances. Substantially all vendor income is recorded as a reduction  of  cost  of  sales.  Vendor  income  earned  can  vary  based  on  a  number  of  factors,  including  purchase  volumes,  sales volumes, and our pricing and promotion strategies.\n\nWe  establish  a  receivable  for  vendor  income  that  is  earned  but  not  yet  received.  Based  on  historical  trending  and  data,  this receivable is computed by forecasting vendor income collections and estimating the amount earned. The majority of the year-end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly. Historically, adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material. Vendor income receivable was $518 million and $504 million as of January 29, 2022, and January 30, 2021, respectively. Vendor income is described further in Note 6 to the Financial Statements.\n\nLong-lived assets: Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed primarily at the store level. An impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and/or eventual disposition of the asset or asset group is less than its carrying amount, and is measured as the excess of its carrying amount over fair value. We estimate fair value by obtaining market appraisals, obtaining valuations from third-party brokers, or using other valuation techniques. We recorded impairments of $87  million,  $62  million,  and  $23  million  in  2021,  2020,  and  2019,  respectively,  which  are  described  further  in  Note  12  to  the Financial Statements.\n\nInsurance/self-insurance: We  retain  a  substantial  portion  of  the  risk  related  to  certain  general  liability,  workers'  compensation, property loss, and team member medical and dental claims. However, we maintain stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure related to  certain  risks.  Liabilities  associated  with  these  losses  include  estimates  of  both  claims  filed  and  losses  incurred  but  not  yet reported. We use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses. General liability and workers' compensation liabilities are recorded based on our estimate of their net present value; other liabilities referred to above are not discounted. Our workers' compensation and general liability accrual was $519 million and $510 million as of January 29, 2022, and  January  30,  2021,  respectively.  We  believe  that  the  amounts  accrued  are  appropriate;  however,  our  liabilities  could  be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions. For example, a 5 percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would have impacted our self-insurance expense by $26 million in 2021. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. Refer to Part II,  Item  7A,  Quantitative  and  Qualitative  Disclosures  About  Market  Risk,  for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures. We maintain insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain events, including network security matters.\n\n2021 Form 10-K",

Such accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change. Other than those amounts, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the cost of any environmental remediation and compliance efforts that subsidiaries of Altria may undertake in the future. In the opinion of management, however, compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including the payment of any remediation costs or damages and the making of related expenditures, has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on Altria's consolidated results of operations, capital expenditures, financial position or cash flows.\n\n## Guarantees and Other Similar Matters\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, certain subsidiaries of Altria have agreed to indemnify a limited number of third parties in the event of future litigation. At December 31, 2021, Altria and certain of its subsidiaries (i) had $48 million of unused letters of credit obtained in the ordinary course of business and (ii) were contingently liable for guarantees related to their own performance, including $19 million for surety bonds recorded on its consolidated balance sheet. In addition, from time to time, subsidiaries of Altria issue lines of credit to affiliated entities. These items have not had, and are not expected to have, a significant impact on Altria's liquidity.\n\nUnder the terms of a distribution agreement between Altria and PMI (the 'Distribution Agreement'), entered into as a result of Altria's 2008 spin-off of its former subsidiary PMI, liabilities concerning tobacco products will be allocated based in substantial part on the manufacturer. PMI will indemnify Altria and PM USA for liabilities related to tobacco products manufactured by PMI or contract manufactured for PMI by PM USA, and PM USA will indemnify PMI for liabilities related to tobacco products manufactured by PM USA, excluding tobacco products contract manufactured for PMI. Altria does not have a related liability recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2021 as the fair value of this indemnification is insignificant. PMI has agreed not to seek indemnification with respect to the IQOS patent litigation discussed above under IQOS Litigation, excluding the patent infringement case filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.\n\nPM USA has issued guarantees relating to Altria's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its $3.0 billion Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program.

Since both companies cite volatile commodity prices as a key macroeconomic risk factor, MDLZ's higher international revenue exposure means it is relatively more vulnerable to fluctuations in commodity prices compared to CL. This is because a larger portion of MDLZ's revenue is subject to the macroeconomic conditions, including commodity price volatility, in international markets where it operates.",

      "answer": "CL faces significant financial pressure due to higher packaging material costs, which negatively impacted consumer demand and forced the company to implement pricing strategies that may reduce sales volumes or shift product mix to lower-margin offerings. Since approximately two-thirds of CL's net sales come from markets outside the U.S., these cost pressures are particularly impactful across its international operations. Similarly, MDLZ is subject to EPR policies in over 25 EU countries that require manufacturers to bear the cost of recycling packaging waste. These policies, along with potential plastic taxes and single-use bans in countries like Indonesia and the Philippines, could increase MDLZ's production and compliance costs, particularly in international markets where regulatory frameworks are evolving. Together, both companies face heightened financial risk from packaging-related cost increases and regulatory requirements, especially in international markets where they have significant exposure but less control over policy changes.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from CL's filing - 'higher raw and packaging material costs' and 'approximately two-thirds of our Net sales originate in markets outside the U.S.', indicating global exposure to cost pressures.",
        "Step 2: Extract from MDLZ's filing - 'over 25 countries in the European Union have implemented extended producer responsibility (EPR) policies' and 'make manufacturers responsible for the cost of recycling food and beverage packaging after consumers use it', showing regulatory cost burden.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies face international cost pressures from packaging, with CL impacted by input costs and MDLZ by regulatory obligations, affecting their financial performance in key global markets."

(f)\n\nMerchandise sales - We record almost all retail store rev enues at the point of sale. Digitally originated sales may include shipping rev enue and are recorded upon deliv ery  to  the  guest  or  upon  guest  pickup  at  the  store.  Merchandise  sales  do  not  include  sales  tax  because  we  are  a  pass-through  conduit  for collecting and remitting sales taxes. Generally, guests may return national brand merchandise within 90 days of purchase and owned and exclusiv e brand merchandise  within one  year  of  purchase.  Sales  are  recognized  net  of  expected  returns,  which  we  estimate  using  historical  return  patterns  and  our expectation  of  future  returns.  As  of  February  1,  2025,  and  February  3,  2024,  the  liability  for  estimated  returns  was  $172  million  and  $170  million, respectiv ely.\n\nWe routinely enter into arrangements with v endors whereby we do not purchase or pay for merchandise until the merchandise is ultimately sold to a guest. Under the v ast majority of these arrangements, which represent less than 5 percent of consolidated sales, we record rev enue and related costs gross. We concluded  that  we  are  the  principal  in  these  transactions  for  a  number  of  reasons,  most  notably  because  we  1)  control  the  ov erall  economics  of  the transactions, including setting the sales price and realizing the majority of cash flows from the sale, 2) control the relationship with the customer, and 3) are responsible for fulfilling the promise to prov ide goods to the customer. Merchandise receiv ed under these arrangements is not included in Inv entory because the purchase and sale of this inv entory are v irtually simultaneous.\n\nRevenue from T arget gift card sales is recognized upon gift card redemption, which is typically within one year of issuance. Our gift cards do not expire. Based on historical redemption rates, a small and relativ ely stable percentage of gift cards will nev er be redeemed, referred to as \"breakage.\" Estimated breakage rev enue is recognized ov er time in proportion to actual gift card redemptions.\n\n2024 Form 10-K\n\n48",

Walmart U.S. does business primarily in three strategic merchandise units, listed below:\n\n- Grocery consists of a full line of grocery items, including dry grocery, snacks, dairy, meat, produce, deli and bakery, frozen foods, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, as well as consumables such as health and beauty aids, pet supplies, household chemicals, paper goods and baby products;\n- General merchandise includes:\n- Entertainment (e.g., electronics, toys, seasonal merchandise, wireless, video games, movies, music and books);\n- Hardlines (e.g., automotive, hardware and paint, sporting goods, outdoor living and stationery);\n- Fashion (e.g., apparel for adults and children, as well as shoes, jewelry and accessories); and\n- Home (e.g., housewares and small appliances, bed and bath, furniture and home organization, home furnishings, home decor, fabrics and crafts).\n- Health and wellness includes pharmacy, over-the-counter drugs and other medical products, and optical services.\n\nPeriodically, revisions are made to the categorization of the components comprising our strategic merchandise units. When revisions are made, the previous periods' presentation is adjusted to maintain comparability.\n\nBrand name merchandise represents a significant portion of the merchandise sold in Walmart U.S. We also market lines of merchandise under our private brands, including brands such as: \"Allswell,\" \"Athletic Works,\" \"bettergoods,\" \"Equate,\" \"Free Assembly,\" \"Freshness Guaranteed,\" \"George,\" \"Great Value,\" \"Holiday Time,\" \"Hyper Tough,\" \"Mainstays,\" \"Marketside,\" \"No Boundaries,\" \"onn.,\" \"Ozark Trail,\" \"Parent's Choice,\" \"Sam's Choice,\" \"Scoop,\" \"Spring Valley,\" \"Time and Tru,\" \"Way to Celebrate\" and \"Wonder Nation.\" The Company also markets lines of merchandise under licensed brands, some of which include: \"Avia,\" \"Better Homes &amp; Gardens,\" \"Sofia Jeans by Sofia Vergara,\" and \"The Pioneer Woman.\"\n\nOther offerings in the Walmart U.S. business include in-house advertising for brands and online marketplace sellers, supply chain and fulfillment capabilities to online marketplace sellers, and data analytics and insights for merchants and suppliers. Additional offerings include fuel, financial services and related products such as money orders, prepaid access, money transfers, check cashing, bill payment and certain types of installment lending.\n\nDistribution. We continue to invest in supply chain automation and utilize a total of 164 distribution facilities which are located strategically throughout the U.S. For fiscal 2025, the majority of Walmart U.S.'s purchases of store merchandise were shipped through these facilities, while most of the remaining store merchandise we purchased was shipped directly from suppliers. General merchandise and dry grocery merchandise is transported primarily through the segment's private truck fleet; however, we contract with common carriers to transport the majority of our perishable grocery merchandise. We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations by leveraging our ability to deliver directly from stores and shipping from our 29 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers.",

      "answer": "Walmart categorizes General Merchandise into four distinct subcategories: Entertainment, Hardlines, Fashion, and Home, with specific examples such as electronics, automotive products, apparel, and furniture. In contrast, Target describes its general merchandise offering as a wide assortment without such granular categorization, emphasizing integration with food items and digital channels in stores larger than 170,000 square feet. While Walmart structures its offerings under strategic merchandise units for operational clarity, Target emphasizes a blended, omnichannel approach to merchandise presentation.",

        "Step 2: Extract from WMT's 10-K - Walmart organizes General Merchandise into four defined units: Entertainment, Hardlines, Fashion, and Home, each with specific product examples such as electronics, automotive, apparel, and furniture.",

When revisions are made, the previous periods' presentation is adjusted to maintain comparability.\n\nBrand name merchandise represents a significant portion of the merchandise sold in Walmart U.S. We also market lines of merchandise under our private brands, including brands such as: \"Allswell,\" \"Athletic Works,\" \"bettergoods,\" \"Equate,\" \"Free Assembly,\" \"Freshness Guaranteed,\" \"George,\" \"Great Value,\" \"Holiday Time,\" \"Hyper Tough,\" \"Mainstays,\" \"Marketside,\" \"No Boundaries,\" \"onn.,\" \"Ozark Trail,\" \"Parent's Choice,\" \"Sam's Choice,\" \"Scoop,\" \"Spring Valley,\" \"Time and Tru,\" \"Way to Celebrate\" and \"Wonder Nation.\" The Company also markets lines of merchandise under licensed brands, some of which include: \"Avia,\" \"Better Homes &amp; Gardens,\" \"Sofia Jeans by Sofia Vergara,\" and \"The Pioneer Woman.\"\n\nOther offerings in the Walmart U.S. business include in-house advertising for brands and online marketplace sellers, supply chain and fulfillment capabilities to online marketplace sellers, and data analytics and insights for merchants and suppliers. Additional offerings include fuel, financial services and related products such as money orders, prepaid access, money transfers, check cashing, bill payment and certain types of installment lending.\n\nDistribution. We continue to invest in supply chain automation and utilize a total of 164 distribution facilities which are located strategically throughout the U.S. For fiscal 2025, the majority of Walmart U.S.'s purchases of store merchandise were shipped through these facilities, while most of the remaining store merchandise we purchased was shipped directly from suppliers. General merchandise and dry grocery merchandise is transported primarily through the segment's private truck fleet; however, we contract with common carriers to transport the majority of our perishable grocery merchandise. We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations by leveraging our ability to deliver directly from stores and shipping from our 29 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers.",

Any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a significant number of our pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies.\n\nOne or a combination of the factors above may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell, our cost of sales associated with our retail pharmacy operations, the net sales and gross margin of those operations or result in the loss of cross-store or cross-club selling opportunities. In addition, these and other factors may adversely affect the type, volume and mix of services we provide and the reimbursement we receive for health and wellness services rendered. Any of these developments could, in turn, adversely affect our overall net sales, other results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\n## Our failure to attract and retain qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes in laws and other labor issues could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nOur ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates globally. Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our ex isting stores, clubs, distribution and fulfillment centers and corporate offices, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous ex ternal factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. Additionally, our ability to successfully ex ecute organizational changes, including our enterprise strategy and management transitions within our senior leadership, and to effectively motivate and retain associates are critical to our business success. We compete for talent with other retail and non-retail businesses, including, for ex ample, technology, health and wellness and fintech businesses, and invest significant resources in training and motivating our associates. Increased competition among potential employers at all levels, including senior management and executive levels, could result in increased associate costs or make it more difficult to recruit and retain associates. If we are unable to locate, attract or retain qualified personnel, or manage leadership transition successfully, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected.\n\nIn addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new, revised or novel interpretations of ex isting labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws, including those related to worker classification, are adopted or implemented that further increase our labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Illegal or inappropriate activ ity of our independent contractors or third-party serv ice prov iders could expose us to liability and adv ersely affect our business, reputation and financial performance.\n\nWe are subject to risks related to our engagement of independent contractors or other third-party service providers. The qualification processes and background checks we utilize when engaging independent contractors may not reveal all potentially relevant information, including accurate worker authorization information and criminal history. If these independent contractors engage in misconduct, consumers may not consider our goods and services safe, and we may receive negative press coverage. Further, we have in the past incurred, and may in the future incur, losses from various types of fraud with respect to unauthorized uses of another person's identity and use of fraudulent identification documents. Any physical injury, loss of life, fraud, property and/or financial damage caused by our independent contractors or third-party service providers could adversely affect our business reputation, which could negatively affect demand for our goods and services, lead to increased regulatory or litigation ex posure and adversely affect our financial performance.\n\n## Financial Risks\n\n## Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.\n\nWe believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market ex pectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our consolidated net sales, consolidated operating income, growth rates, eCommerce growth rates, advertising and other higher-margin initiatives (which are ex pected to help drive our operating income growth at a rate faster than net sales over the long term), capital ex penditures, comparable store and club sales growth rates or earnings and adjusted earnings per share could cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies, changes in our effective tax rates, changes in our financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts or, failure of our performance to compare favorably to that of other retailers may have a negative effect on the price of our stock.\n\n## Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations.\n\nOur operations in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and ex penses of our operations outside of the U.S. from local currencies into U.S. dollars using ex change rates for the current period. In recent years, fluctuations in currency exchange rates that were unfavorable have had adverse effects on our reported results of operations.",

Sam's Club organizes its offerings into four merchandise categories, which also experience variation in gross margins.

If we are unable to effectiv ely manage these costs or if we face  significant  increases  in  any  of  these  costs,  our  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition  could  be  adv ersely  affected.  In  particular ,  for  certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we generally pay interchange fees and other processing fees. Giv en the continued adoption of credit and debit cards by consumers, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant costs as a result of these fees. Any increase in these fees over time could significantly increase our expenses and adv ersely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Legal, Regulatory, Global, and Other External Risks\n\n## Our earnings depend on the state of macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence and spending in the U.S.\n\nNearly all of our sales are in the U.S., making our results highly dependent on the health of the U.S. economy and U.S. consumer behav ior, confidence, and spending, which can be affected by a v ariety of factors, including inflation, interest rates, housing prices, unemployment rates, legal and regulatory actions (including  through  executiv e  orders),  immigration  policies  and  trends,  household  debt  and  wage  lev els,  credit  usage,  and  crime  rates.  In  addition,  the interconnected  nature  of  the  global  economy  means  that  ev ents  occurring  domestically  or  internationally,  such  as  geopolitical  conflicts,  social  unrest, terrorist  attacks,  armed  conflicts,  public  health  crises,  legal  and  regulatory  actions,  immigration  policies  and  trends,  energy  av ailability,  trade  policies, disputes,  or  sanctions,  and  market  v olatility  can  all  affect  macroeconomic  conditions  in  the  U.S. A  deterioration  in  U.S.  macroeconomic  conditions  or consumer  confidence  or  spending  could  adv ersely  affect  our  business  in  many  ways,  such  as  negativ ely  impacting  consumer  demand  (which  may disproportionately affect demand for certain merchandise), reducing sales (including our credit card profit-sharing rev enue), reducing gross margins, and increasing our expenses, each of which could adv ersely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions or natural disasters, the impacts of a changing climate, and other catastrophic events could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nUncharacteristic or significant weather conditions, including the physical impacts of a changing climate, and other catastrophic ev ents can affect consumer shopping patterns, particularly in apparel and seasonal items, which could lead to lower sales or greater than expected markdowns and adv ersely affect our results of operations. In addition, we hav e significant operations in certain states where natural disasters (including hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires, and earthquakes) are more prev alent. Natural disasters in those states or in other areas where we operate has prev iously resulted, and could in the future result,  in  significant  physical  damage  to,  or  closure  of,  one  or  more  of  our  stores,  distribution  centers,  facilities,  or  key  v endors.  Furthermore,  weather conditions,  natural  disasters,  and  other  catastrophic  ev ents  in  areas  where  we  or  our  v endors  operate,  or  depend  upon  for  continued  operations,  hav e adversely affected, and could in the future adv ersely affect, the av ailability and cost of certain products within our supply chain, consumer purchasing power, and consumer demand. Additionally, acts of v iolence and other crimes, including activ e shooter situations, at or around our stores, distribution centers, or other facilities may negativ ely impact the safety and security of our workforce and guests, damage our facilities, and harm our reputation. Any of these events could adv ersely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe potential  impacts  of  a  changing  climate  may  be  widespread  and  unpredictable  and  present  a  v ariety  of  risks  in  the  short-term  and  long-term.  T he physical effects of a changing climate, such as natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, drought, and rising sea lev els, could adv ersely affect our results  of  operations,  including  by  increasing  our  energy  costs,  disrupting  our  supply  chain,  negativ ely  impacting  our  workforce,  damaging  our  stores, distribution centers, and inv entory, and threatening the habitability of the locations in which we operate. In addition to physical risks, the potential impacts of a changing climate also present transition risks, including regulatory and reputational risks. For example, we use commodities and energy inputs in our operations that may face increased regulation due to a changing climate or other env ironmental concerns, which could increase our costs. Furthermore, our establishment and continuation of our goals and initiativ es to create a more resilient business, or any modification, conclusion, failure, or perceiv ed failure by  us  to  achiev e  them,  or  to  otherwise  meet  ev olv ing,  v aried,  and  sometimes  conflicting  expectations  from  our  shareholders,  guests,  team  members, vendors, and other third parties (including gov ernmental entities and officials and non-gov ernmental organizations) regarding the env ironment and our goals and initiativ es  to  create  a  more  resilient  business,  could  lead  to  adv erse  perceptions  of  our  business,  consumer  boycotts, litigation,  inv estigations,  and regulatory proceedings. Any of these outcomes could adv ersely affect our reputation, results of operations, and financial condition.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive reports shipping and handling costs as part of Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses, while Target includes these costs in Cost of Sales. As a result, Colgate-Palmolive's gross profit margin appears higher by 880 basis points in 2024 compared to if these costs were included in Cost of Sales, making direct comparisons of gross margin between the two companies misleading without adjustment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From CL's 10-K, shipping and handling costs are reported in SG&A expenses, not in Cost of Sales, and this results in a higher gross profit margin by 880 bps in 2024.",
        "Step 2: From TGT's 10-K, there is no indication that shipping and handling is treated differently from industry norms, implying that these costs are included in Cost of Sales.",
        "Step 3: The difference in accounting treatment directly affects the comparability of gross profit margins between CL and TGT, requiring adjustment for accurate financial analysis."

This ASU requires a joint venture to initially measure all contributions received upon its formation at fair value. This guidance is applicable to joint ventures with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025 and is not ex pected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-01, 'Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements.' This ASU clarified the accounting for leasehold improvements for leases under common control. The guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2024 and did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, 'Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations.' This ASU requires a buyer that uses supplier finance programs to make annual disclosures about the programs' key terms, the balance sheet presentation of related amounts, the confirmed amount outstanding at the end of the period and associated roll-forward information. The Company adopted the guidance beginning on January 1, 2023, and with respect to the roll-forward information disclosure, beginning on January 1, 2024. See Note 15, Supplier Finance Programs to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Use of E stimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company's critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board.\n\nIn certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company's significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for inventories and shipping and handling costs.\n\n- The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out ('FIFO') method (approximately 75% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out ('LIFO') method (approximately 25% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2024 or 2023 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.\n- Shipping and handling costs (also referred to as logistics costs) may be reported as either a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company accounts for such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, as fulfillment costs and reports them in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company's Gross profit margin is not comparable with the Gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in Cost of sales. If such costs had been included as a component of Cost of sales, the Company's Gross profit margin would have been lower by 880 bps in 2024, 910 bps in 2023 and 1040 bps in 2022, with no impact on reported earnings.\n\nThe areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax  valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reserves.\n\n- In accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for U.S. defined benefit plans was 5.73% and 5.40% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other U.S. postretirement plans was 5.74% and 5.37% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) faces risks from global regulatory authorities that could restrict the use of ingredients or packaging, potentially leading to product reformulation, recalls, or reputational damage. These jurisdictional restrictions could result in civil remedies like fines or injunctions, directly affecting their business operations and financial condition. On the other hand, Costco (COST) is impacted by jurisdictional restrictions through local land use and environmental regulations that hinder their ability to expand warehouses and depots, particularly in California and Canada, which account for 27% and 85% of their sales and operating income respectively. These restrictions increase operational costs and may delay or prevent new warehouse openings, directly affecting their growth and profitability. While both companies are subject to regulatory compliance, CL's exposure is ingredient and packaging-focused across global markets, whereas COST's challenges are location-specific and expansion-related.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are impacted by jurisdictional restrictions, but in different ways: CL faces ingredient and packaging-related regulatory risks globally, while COST's risks are tied to physical expansion constraints in key markets."

In addition, our selling practices are regulated by competition law authorities in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nNew or more stringent legal or regulatory requirements, or more restrictive interpretations of ex isting requirements, could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For example, from time to time, various regulatory authorities around the world review the use of various ingredients and packaging content in consumer products. While we monitor and seek to mitigate the impact of any emerging information, a decision by a regulatory or governmental authority that any ingredient or packaging content in our products should be restricted or should otherwise be newly regulated could adversely impact our business and reputation, as could negative reactions by our consumers, trade customers or non-governmental organizations to our current or prior use of such ingredients or packaging. Additionally, an inability to develop new or reformulated products containing alternative ingredients, to obtain regulatory approval of such products or ingredients on a timely basis or to effectively market and sell such products could likewise adversely affect our business.\n\nBecause of our extensive international operations, we could be adversely affected by violations of worldwide anti-bribery laws, including those that prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and laws that prohibit commercial bribery. We are also subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the U.S. (including, without limitation, those imposed by OFAC) and/or by other jurisdictions that may prohibit us or certain of our affiliates from doing business in certain countries, or restrict the kind of business that may be conducted. While our policies mandate compliance with these laws, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, joint venture partners or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation and our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nWhile it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business, findings that we are in violation of, or out of compliance with, applicable laws or regulations have subjected us to, and could subject us to, civil remedies, including fines, damages, injunctions or product recalls, or criminal sanctions, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Even if a claim is unsuccessful, is without merit or is not fully pursued, the cost of responding to such a claim, including management time and out-ofpocket expenses, and the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products, processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation, brand image and our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For information regarding our legal and regulatory matters, see Item 3 'Legal Proceedings' and Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Legal claims and proceedings could adversely impact our business.\n\nAs a global company serving consumers in more than 200 countries and territories, we are and may continue to be subject to a wide variety of legal claims and proceedings, including disputes relating to intellectual property, contracts, product liability, marketing, advertising, foreign ex change controls, antitrust and trade regulation, as well as labor and employment, pension, data privacy and security, environmental and tax matters and consumer class actions. Regardless of their merit, these claims can require significant time and expense to investigate and defend. Since litigation is inherently uncertain, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or proceedings, or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters, including any reserves taken in connection therewith, will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such matters. In addition, if one of our products, or an ingredient contained in our products, is perceived or found to be defective, or unsafe or have a quality issue, we have had to and may in the future need to withdraw, recall or reformulate some of our products. Whether or not a legal claim or proceeding is successful, or a withdrawal, recall or reformulation is required or advisable, such assertions could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the negative publicity surrounding them could harm our reputation and brand image. The resolution of, or increase in the reserves taken in connection with, one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition for that period. See Item 3 'Legal Proceedings' and Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on certain of our legal claims and proceedings.",

We could also be affected by additional risks that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial.  These  Risk  Factors should be carefully rev iewed in conjunction with  Management ' s  Discussion  and Analysis  of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8 of this Report.\n\n## Business and Operating Risks\n\n## We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our U.S. and Canadian operations.\n\nOur financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our U.S. and Canadian operations, which comprised 86% and 85% of net sales and operating income in 2024. Within the U.S., we are highly dependent on our California operations, which comprised 27% of U.S. net sales in 2024. Our California market, in general, has a larger percentage of higher v olume warehouses as compared to our other domestic markets. Any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adv ersely affect our business and financial results. Declines in financial performance of our U.S. operations,  particularly  in  California,  and  our  Canadian  operations  could  arise  from,  among  other  things:  slow  growth  or  declines  in  comparable warehouse sales (comparable sales); negativ e trends in operating expenses, including increased labor, healthcare and energy costs; failing to meet targets for warehouse openings; cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses; shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products; changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets, including higher lev els of unemployment and depressed home v alues; and failing to consistently prov ide high quality and innov ativ e new products.\n\nWe may be unsuccessful implementing our growth strategy, including expanding our business in existing markets and new markets, and integrating acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nOur growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses and depots. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations. Local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses and depots, as well as  local  community  actions  opposed  to  the  location  of  our  warehouses  or  depots  at  specific  sites  and  the  adoption  of  local  laws  restricting  our operations and env ironmental regulations, may impact our ability to find suitable locations and increase the cost of sites and of constructing, leasing and operating warehouses and depots. We also may have difficulty negotiating leases or purchase agreements on acceptable terms. In addition, certain jurisdictions hav e enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prev ent or restrict the operation or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including us. Failure to effectiv ely manage these and other similar factors may affect our ability to timely build or lease and operate new warehouses and depots, which could hav e a material adv erse effect on our future growth and profitability.\n\nWe  seek  to  expand  in  existing  markets  to  attain  a  greater  ov erall  market  share.  A  new  warehouse  may  draw  members  away  from  our  existing warehouses and adversely affect their comparable sales performance, member traffic, and profitability.\n\nWe intend to continue to open warehouses in new markets. Associated risks include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us, attracting members of other wholesale club operators, our lesser familiarity with local member preferences, and seasonal differences in the market. Entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large, established market presence. We cannot  ensure  that  new  warehouses  and  new  e-commerce  sites  will  be  profitable  and  future  profitability  could  be  delayed  or  otherwise  materially adversely affected.",

E mployee Stock Ownership Plan\n\nIn 1989, the Company expanded its Employee Stock Ownership Plan ('ESOP') through the introduction of a leveraged ESOP that funds certain benefits for employees who have met eligibility requirements. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were 7,428,343 and 8,348,104 shares of common stock, respectively, outstanding and issued to the Company's ESOP.\n\nDuring 2000, the ESOP entered into a loan agreement with the Company under which the benefits of the ESOP may be extended through 2035. As of December 31, 2024, the ESOP had no outstanding borrowings from the Company.\n\nDividends on stock held by the ESOP are paid to the ESOP trust and, together with cash contributions from the Company, are (a) used by the ESOP to repay principal and interest, (b) credited to participant accounts, (c) used for contributions to the Company's defined contribution plans or (d) used to pay the Company's defined contribution plan expenses. Stock is allocated to participants based upon the ratio of the current year's debt service to the sum of total outstanding principal and interest payments over the life of the debt. As of December 31, 2024, 7,334,758 shares of common stock had been released and allocated to participant accounts and 93,585 shares of common stock were available for future release and allocation to participant accounts.\n\nDividends on the stock used to repay principal and interest or credited to participant accounts are deductible for income tax purposes and, accordingly, are reflected net of their tax  benefit in the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders' Equity.\n\nAnnual expense related to the ESOP was $0 in 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\nThe Company paid dividends on the shares held by the ESOP of $16 in 2024, $17 in 2023 and $19 in 2022.

We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believ e  to  be  reasonable,  and  we  continue  to  rev iew  and  ev aluate  these  estimates.  For  further  information  on  significant  accounting  policies,  see discussion in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\n\n## Insurance/Self-insurance Liabilities\n\nClaims for  employee  health-care  benefits,  workers'  compensation,  general  liability,  property  damage,  directors'  and  officers'  liability,  v ehicle  liability, inv entory  loss,  and  other  exposures  are  funded  predominantly  through  self-insurance.  Insurance  cov erage  is  maintained  for  certain  risks  to  limit exposures to v ery large losses. We use v arious risk management mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captiv e insurance subsidiary, and participate in a  reinsurance  program.  Liabilities  associated  with  the  risks  that  we  retain  are  not  discounted  and  are  estimated  using  historical  claims  experience, demographic factors, sev erity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The costs of claims are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate as a result of inflation rates, regulatory or legal changes, and unforeseen dev elopments in claims. While we believ e our estimates are reasonable, actual claims and costs could differ significantly from recorded liabilities.

This extensive global distribution network, combined with beverages being one of MDLZ's five core product categories, creates a strategic advantage for international beverage distribution. In contrast, beverages are a smaller component of TGT's broader grocery offerings, which also include perishables, deli, bakery, and food service like Starbucks, suggesting a more domestically focused and diversified retail approach rather than a dedicated beverage distribution strategy.",

In addition, employees contributed $23 million to our non-U.S. plans. We make contributions to our pension plans in accordance with local funding arrangements and statutory minimum funding requirements.

In 2025, we estimate that our pension contributions will be $11 million to our U.S. plans and $68 million to our non-U.S. plans based on current tax laws. Our actual contributions may be different due to many factors, including changes in tax and other benefit laws, significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates.\n\n## Future Benefit Payments\n\nThe estimated future benefit payments from our pension plans at December 31, 2024 were (in millions):\n\n",

There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## We may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance.\n\nClaims  for  employee  health  care  benefits,  workers'  compensation,  general  liability,  property  damage,  directors'  and officers' liability, vehicle liability, inventory loss, and other exposures are funded predominantly through self-insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for certain  risks  to  limit  exposures  arising  from  very  large  losses. The  types  and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements. Significant claims or events, regulatory changes, a substantial rise in costs of health care or costs to maintain our insurance or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAlthough we maintain specific coverages for catastrophic property losses, we still bear a significant portion of the risk of losses incurred as a result of any physical damage to, or the destruction of, any warehouses, depots, manufacturing or home office facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption. Such losses could materially impact our cash flows and results of operations.\n\n## Market and Other External Risks\n\nWe face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe retail business is highly competitive. We compete for members, employees, sites, products and services and in other important respects with a wide range of local, regional and national wholesalers and retailers, both in the United States  and  in  foreign  countries,  including  other  warehouse-club  operators,  supermarkets,  supercenters,  internet retailers, gasoline stations, hard discounters, department and specialty stores and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise. Such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of ways, including pricing, selection and availability, services, location, convenience, store hours, and the attractiveness and ease of use of websites and mobile applications. The evolution of retailing in online and mobile channels has improved the ability of customers to comparison shop, which has enhanced competition. Some competitors have greater financial resources and technology capabilities, better access to merchandise, and greater market penetration than we do. Our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, changes in the retail markets or customer expectations could result in lost market share and negatively affect our financial results.\n\n## General  economic  factors,  domestically  and  internationally,  may  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nHigher energy and gasoline costs, inflation, levels of unemployment, healthcare costs, consumer debt levels, foreigncurrency  exchange  rates,  unsettled  financial  markets,  weaknesses  in  housing  and  real  estate  markets,  reduced consumer confidence, changes and uncertainties related to government fiscal",

Our  business  will  be  adversely  affected  if  we  are  unable  to  maintain  and  develop  successful relationships with e-commerce retailers and hard discounters, while also maintaining relationships with our key customers operating in traditional retail channels (many of whom are also focused on increasing their ecommerce sales). Our business can be adversely affected if e-commerce channels and hard discounters take significant  additional  market  share  away  from  traditional  retailers  or  we  fail  to  find  ways  to  create increasingly  better  digital  tools  and  capabilities  for  our  retail  customers  to  enable  them  to  grow  their businesses. In addition, our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to profitably expand our own direct-to-consumer e-commerce capabilities. The retail industry is also impacted by increased consolidation of ownership and purchasing power, particularly in North America, Europe and Latin America, resulting in large retailers or buying groups with increased purchasing power, impacting our ability to compete in these areas. Consolidation also adversely impacts our smaller customers' ability to compete effectively, resulting in an inability on their part to pay for our products or reduced or canceled orders of our products. Further, we must  maintain  mutually  beneficial  relationships  with  our  key  customers,  including  Walmart,  to  compete effectively. Any  inability  to  resolve  a  significant  dispute  with  any  of  our  key  customers,  a  change  in  the business condition (financial or otherwise) of any of our key customers, even if unrelated to us, a significant reduction  in  sales  to  any  key  customer,  or  the  loss  of  any  of  our  key  customers  can  adversely  affect  our business.\n\n## Disruption of our manufacturing operations or supply chain, including increased commodity, packaging, transportation, labor and other input costs, can adversely affect our business.\n\nWe  have  experienced  and  could  continue  to  experience  disruption  in  our  manufacturing  operations  and supply chain. Many of the raw materials and supplies used in the production of our products are sourced from countries  experiencing  civil  unrest,  political  instability  or  unfavorable  economic  conditions.  Some  raw materials and supplies, including packaging materials, are available only from a limited number of suppliers or from a sole supplier or are in short supply when seasonal demand is at its peak. There can be no assurance that  we  will  be  able  to  maintain  favorable  arrangements  and  relationships  with  suppliers  or  that  our contingency plans will be effective to prevent disruptions that may arise from shortages or discontinuation of any  raw  materials  and  other  supplies  that  we  use  in  the  manufacture,  production  and  distribution  of  our products. Any sustained or significant disruption to the manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials could increase our costs and interrupt product supply, which can adversely impact our business.\n\nThe raw materials and other supplies, including agricultural commodities, fuel and packaging materials, such as  recycled  PET,  transportation,  labor  and  other  supply  chain  inputs  that  we  use  for  the  manufacturing, production  and  distribution  of  our  products  are  subject  to  price  volatility  and  fluctuations  in  availability caused by many factors, including changes in supply and demand, supplier capacity constraints, inflation, weather  conditions  (including  potential  effects  of  climate  change),  fire,  natural  disasters,  disease  or  pests (including the impact of greening disease on the citrus industry), agricultural uncertainty, health epidemics or pandemics  or  other  contagious  outbreaks  (including  COVID-19),  labor  shortages  (including  the  lack  of availability of truck drivers or as a result of COVID-19), strikes or work stoppages, governmental incentives and controls (including import/export restrictions, such as new or increased tariffs, sanctions, quotas or trade barriers), port  congestions  or  delays,  transport  capacity  constraints,  cybersecurity  incidents  or  other disruptions,  loss  or  impairment  of  key  manufacturing  sites,  political  uncertainties,  acts  of  terrorism, governmental instability or currency exchange rates. Many of our raw materials and supplies are purchased in the open market and the prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation.

PepsiCo, on the other hand, employs global purchasing programs that include fixed-price contracts, purchase orders, and pricing agreements as part of a broader strategy to manage commodity price risks affecting raw materials and energy costs.

Insurance coverage is maintained for certain risks to limit exposures arising from very large losses. The Company uses different  risk  management  mechanisms,  including  a  wholly-owned  captive  insurance  subsidiary  (the  captive)  and participates in a reinsurance program. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted  and  are  estimated,  in  part,  by  considering  historical  claims  experience,  demographic  factors,  severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. At the end of 2022 and 2021, these insurance liabilities were $1,364 and $1,257 in the aggregate, respectively, and were included in accrued salaries and benefits and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, classified based on their nature.\n\nThe captive receives direct premiums, which are netted against the Company's premium costs in selling, general and administrative expenses, in the consolidated statements of income. The captive participates in a reinsurance program that includes other third-party participants. The reinsurance agreement is one year in duration, and new agreements are entered into by each participant at their discretion at the commencement of the next calendar year. The participant agreements and practices of the reinsurance program are designed to limit a participating members' individual risk. Income statement adjustments related to the reinsurance program and related impacts to the consolidated balance sheets are recognized as information becomes known. In the event the Company leaves the reinsurance program, the Company retains its primary obligation to the policyholders for prior activity.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nThe Company is exposed to foreign-currency exchange-rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. It manages these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact  of  fluctuations  of  foreign  exchange  on  known  future  expenditures  denominated  in  a  non-functional  foreigncurrency. The  contracts  relate  primarily  to  U.S.  dollar  merchandise  inventory  expenditures  made  by  the  Company's international subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for  derivative  hedge  accounting. The  Company  seeks  to  mitigate  risk  with  the  use  of  these  contracts  and  does  not intend to engage in speculative transactions. Some of these contracts contain credit-risk-related contingent features that require settlement of outstanding contracts upon certain triggering events. The aggregate fair value amounts of derivative  instruments  in  a  net  liability  position  and  the  amount  needed  to  settle  the  instruments  immediately  if  the credit-risk-related  contingent  features  were  triggered  were  immaterial  at  the  end  of  2022.  There  were  no  derivative instruments in a net liability position at the end of 2021. The aggregate notional amounts of open, unsettled forward foreign-exchange  contracts  were  $1,242  and  $1,331  at  the  end  of  2022  and  2021,  respectively.  See  Note  3  for information on the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts at the end of 2022 and 2021.\n\nThe  unrealized  gains  or  losses  recognized  in  interest  income  and  other,  net  in  the  accompanying  consolidated statements of income relating to the net changes in the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts were immaterial in 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\nThe  Company  is  exposed  to  fluctuations  in  prices  for  energy,  particularly  electricity  and  natural  gas,  and  other commodity products used in retail and manufacturing operations, which it seeks to partially mitigate through the use of fixed-price contracts for certain of its warehouses and other facilities, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. The Company also enters into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for its gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for investments measured at fair value.\n\n- U.S. and Foreign Government Securities : U.S. and foreign government securities consist of investments in Treasury Nominal Bonds and Inflation Protected Securities, agency bonds and municipal securities. Government securities are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information, such as broker quotes. Matrix pricing, yield curves and indices are used when broker quotes are not available.\n- Corporate Debt Instruments : Corporate debt instruments are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information, such as broker quotes. Matrix pricing, yield curves and indices are used when broker quotes are not available.\n- Common Stock : Common stocks are valued based on the price of the security as listed on an open active exchange on last trade date.\n- Asset Backed Securities : Asset backed securities are fix ed income securities such as mortgage backed securities and auto loans that are collateralized by pools of underlying assets that are unable to be sold individually. They are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information or a broker quote in a non-active over-the-counter market.\n- Collective Investment Funds : Collective investment funds consist of funds that are intended to mirror indices such as Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index and MSCI EAFE Index. They are valued on the basis of the relative interest of each participating investor in the fair value of the underlying assets of each of the respective collective investment funds, which are valued based on the net asset value ('NAV'), and are provided by the investment account manager as a practical expedient to estimate fair value. These investments are not classified by level but are disclosed to permit reconciliation to the fair value of plan assets.\n\nCash Flows: We make contributions to our pension plans to the extent that the contributions are tax deductible and pay benefits that relate to plans for salaried employees that cannot be funded under IRS regulations. Currently, we anticipate making employer contributions to our pension and postretirement plans of up to approximately $30 million for each in 2025. However, the foregoing estimates of 2025 contributions to our pension and postretirement plans are subject to change as a result of changes in tax  and other benefit laws, changes in interest rates, as well as asset performance significantly above or below the assumed long-term rate of return for each respective plan.",

      "answer": "KO's total notional value of derivatives designated for cash flow hedging programs was $10,916 million (foreign currency: $9,408 million + commodity: $54 million + interest rate: $750 million + foreign currency denominated assets/liabilities: $958 million) as of December 31, 2023. PG, on the other hand, reported $307 million in fair value of instruments in a net liability position under similar hedging arrangements as of June 30, 2024. This indicates that KO has a significantly larger exposure to cash flow hedging programs, suggesting a more aggressive or comprehensive approach to managing market risks such as foreign exchange, commodity price fluctuations, and interest rate variability compared to PG.",

In contrast, KO only lists 'Note 9 - Supply Chain Finance Program' in its table of contents without providing any detailed financial information about its SCF arrangements.

Meanwhile, Philip Morris International includes Coca-Cola in its 2023 Peer Group analysis, grouping it among major global consumer product companies with similar revenue size and market capitalization.

      "question": "Given both companies' reliance on long-term debt financing as a key component of their capital structure, how does the specific use of $9.9 billion in net borrowings by PM for the Swedish Match acquisition compare with PEP's strategic use of long-term debt, and what does this reveal about their differing capital allocation priorities?",
      "answer": "PM specifically used $9.9 billion in net borrowings under credit facilities in 2022 to finance the Swedish Match acquisition, reflecting a strategic move to expand its smoke-free product portfolio through acquisition. In contrast, PEP notes its use of long-term debt financing as part of a broader liquidity and capital resources framework to fund operating, investing, and financing needs, including debt repayments, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and shareholder returns, but does not specify a particular acquisition or capital outlay. This reveals that PM's long-term debt usage was targeted toward a specific high-impact acquisition, whereas PEP's approach is more general, supporting a wider range of ongoing corporate activities.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - PEP mentions long-term debt financing as part of its liquidity and capital resources but does not specify a dollar amount or particular use case.",

      "answer": "When broker quotes are unavailable, both TGT and MO rely on matrix pricing as an alternative valuation method for government securities. However, MO explicitly describes using additional inputs such as yield curves and indices alongside matrix pricing, whereas TGT only mentions matrix pricing and quoted prices of similar securities. This implies that MO employs a more diversified approach to estimate fair value in the absence of direct market data compared to TGT\u2019s more limited reliance on matrix pricing.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, we learn that MO uses matrix pricing, yield curves, and indices to value U.S. and Foreign Government Securities when broker quotes are unavailable.",

        "Step 3: Comparing both approaches, we conclude that while both companies use matrix pricing when broker quotes are not available, MO incorporates more supplementary methods than TGT."

      "question": "What is the difference in the reported LIFO reserve amounts between Altria (MO) and Target (TGT), and how does each company's use of the LIFO method impact its inventory valuation differently?",
      "answer": "Altria (MO) reported a LIFO reserve of $0.7 billion for its inventories as of December 31, 2023, while Target (TGT) did not explicitly disclose a LIFO reserve but valued its inventory at $11.9 billion as of February 3, 2024, using the LIFO method under the retail inventory accounting method. Altria\u2019s LIFO reserve indicates that its inventory is valued $0.7 billion lower under LIFO compared to current cost, directly impacting gross margin and taxable income. In contrast, Target\u2019s use of LIFO primarily affects its cost of sales through market adjustments, shrink reserves, and markdowns, which are more frequent due to the fast-turning nature of retail inventory (typically under three months). The difference in LIFO reserve amounts is at least $0.7 billion, as Target does not report a separate reserve but instead focuses on shrink risk, where a 10% increase in the shrink reserve would raise cost of sales by $150 million. This reflects differing impacts of LIFO on tobacco manufacturing (long-term curing inventories) versus retail (short-cycle consumer goods).",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Altria (MO) uses LIFO for 76% of its inventory and reports a LIFO reserve of $0.7 billion as of December 31, 2023.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Target (TGT) uses LIFO under the retail inventory method for the majority of its inventory, valued at $11.9 billion as of February 3, 2024, and discusses shrink reserve sensitivity ($150 million impact for 10% increase).",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While both companies use LIFO, Altria\u2019s LIFO reserve directly reflects a cumulative cost difference from current prices, affecting gross margin and tax reporting. Target\u2019s LIFO application is more dynamic due to retail inventory turnover and markdown/shrink sensitivity, impacting cost of sales more frequently. The explicit LIFO reserve difference is at least $0.7 billion since TGT does not disclose a reserve, but does quantify shrink sensitivity."

      "question": "What was the financial impact of KO's 2024 pension asset transfer on its 2025 net periodic pension cost, and how does this compare with TGT's strategy to manage pension risk through asset allocation and interest rate hedging?",
      "answer": "KO's transfer of $523 million of surplus international plan assets from pension trusts to general assets in 2024 led to a significant increase in its 2025 net periodic pension cost, which rose from $45 million in 2024 to an expected $81 million in 2025. This increase was primarily due to a lower expected return on plan assets following the transfer. In contrast, TGT employs a dual strategy to manage pension risk: it follows an asset allocation policy designed to reduce the long-term cost of pension funding and uses an interest rate hedging program involving derivative instruments to mitigate the risk of adverse interest rate movements. While KO experienced a cost increase due to asset reallocation, TGT proactively manages risk through both strategic allocation and active hedging.",

          "chunk_text": "Intangible assets acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, because they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and macroeconomic conditions present at the time of acquisition. Consequently, if operating results and/or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate shortly after an acquisition, it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets. A deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the discount rates. If the discount rates change, our Company may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are equal to, or greater than, our previously forecasted amounts. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent acquisitions, if applicable.\n\nIn November 2021, the Company acquired the remaining 85% ownership interest in, and now owns 100% of BA Sports Nutrition, LLC ('BodyArmor'), which offers a line of sports performance and hydration beverages. During 2021, in conjunction with acquiring the remaining ownership interest, we recognized a noncash gain of $834 million resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in BodyArmor to fair value. The Company allocated $4.2 billion of the $5.6 billion purchase price to the BodyArmor trademark. During the three months ended March 29, 2024, the operating results related to the trademark were lower than expected. Therefore, the Company revised its projections of the future operating results related to the trademark, which triggered the need to update its impairment analysis. As a result, the Company concluded that the fair value of the trademark was less than its carrying value and recorded an impairment charge of $760 million. The decrease in fair value was primarily driven by the revised projections of future operating results as well as higher discount rates resulting from changes in macroeconomic conditions since the acquisition date. As of December 31, 2024, the fair value of this trademark approximates its carrying value. If the near-term operating results of this trademark do not achieve our revised financial projections, or if the macroeconomic conditions change, causing the discount rate to increase without an offsetting increase in the operating results, it is likely that we would be required to recognize an additional impairment charge. Management will continue to monitor the fair value of this trademark in future periods.\n\n## Pension Plan Valuations\n\nOur Company sponsors a qualified pension plan covering substantially all U.S. employees as well as unfunded nonqualified pension plans for certain employees in the United States. In addition, our Company and its subsidiaries have various pension plans outside the United States.\n\nManagement is required to make certain critical estimates related to the actuarial assumptions used to determine our pension obligations and our net periodic pension cost or income. We believe the two most critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Our actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually, or more frequently to the extent that a settlement or curtailment occurs. Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension obligations and our net periodic pension cost or income.\n\nThe discount rate assumption used to account for pension plans reflects the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. The discount rate for U.S. and certain non-U.S. plans is determined using a matching technique whereby the rates of a yield curve, developed from high-quality debt securities, are applied to projected benefit cash flows to determine the appropriate effective discount rate. For other non-U.S. plans, we base the discount rate assumption on comparable indices within each of the respective countries. The Company measures the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost or income by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans' projected cash flows.\n\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based upon the long-term outlook of our investment strategy as well as our historical returns and volatilities for each asset class. We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of our ex pected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Our investment objective for our pension assets is to ensure all funded pension plans have sufficient assets to meet their benefit obligations when they become due. As a result, the Company periodically revises asset allocations, where appropriate, to seek to improve returns and manage risk.\n\nIn 2024, the Company's total net periodic pension cost was $45 million. In 2025, we expect our net periodic pension cost to be approximately $81 million. The increase in net periodic pension cost is primarily due to a lower ex pected return on assets resulting from a transfer of $523 million of surplus international plan assets from pension trusts to general assets of the Company in 2024.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the U.S. qualified pension plan represented 64% and 58% of the Company's consolidated projected benefit obligation and pension plan assets, respectively. For this plan, we estimate that a 50 basis-point decrease in the discount rate would result in a $7 million increase in our 2025 net periodic pension cost, and we estimate that a 50 basis-point decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would result in an $18 million increase in our 2025 net periodic pension cost.\n\nRefer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our pension plans and related actuarial assumptions.",

          "chunk_text": "## If we are unable to successfully manage new product launches, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\n\nDue to the highly competitive nature of the commercial beverage industry, the Company continually introduces new products and evolves existing products to stimulate consumer demand. For instance, the Company has directly entered the alcohol beverage category in numerous markets outside the United States, and in the United States, the Company has established a wholly owned, indirect, firewalled subsidiary, which uses third-party manufacturers and distributors to produce and sell alcohol products in certain regions of the United States and also authorizes alcohol-licensed third parties to use certain of our trademarks and related intellectual property on alcohol beverages that contain Company beverage bases. The success of new and evolved products depends on several factors, including timely and successful product development, adherence to new global and/or local standards of practice, consumer acceptance and stakeholder perception. Such endeavors may also involve significant risks and uncertainties, including greater ex ecution risks; higher costs; lower rates of sales; distraction of management from ex isting operations; lower product, category or industry knowledge and expertise; slower than expected or inadequate return on investments; increased competitive pressures; stakeholder scrutiny; and reliance on the performance of third parties. As we become subject to additional governmental regulations, including alcohol regulations related to licensing, trade and pricing practices; labeling, advertising, promotion and marketing practices; and relationships with distributors, we may become exposed to the risk of increased compliance costs and disruptions to our existing business.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO THE COCA-COLA SYSTEM\n\n## We rely on our bottling partners for a significant portion of our business. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our bottling partners, our business could suffer.\n\nWe generate a significant portion of our net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to independent bottling partners. As independent companies, our bottling partners, some of which are publicly traded companies, make their own business decisions that may not always align with our interests. In addition, some of our bottling partners have the right to manufacture or distribute their own products or certain products of other beverage companies. If we are unable to maintain operating and strategic alignment or agree on appropriate pricing and marketing and advertising support, or if our bottling partners are not satisfied with our brand innovation and development efforts, they may take actions that, while maximizing     their own short-term profits, may be detrimental to our Company or our brands, or they may devote more of their resources         to business opportunities or products other than those of the Company. Such actions could, in the long term, have an adverse effect on our profitability.\n\n## If our bottling partners' financial condition deteriorates, our business and financial results could be affected.\n\nIn the vast majority of our markets, our products are sold and distributed by independent bottling partners, and we therefore derive a significant portion of our net operating revenues from sales of concentrates and syrups to independent bottling partners. Accordingly, the success of our business depends in part on our bottling partners' financial strength and profitability. While under our agreements with our bottling partners we generally have the right to unilaterally change the prices we charge for our concentrates and syrups, our ability to do so may be materially limited by our bottling partners' financial condition and their ability to pass price increases along to their customers. In addition, we have investments in certain of our bottling partners, which we account for under the equity method, and our operating results include our proportionate share of such bottling partners' income or loss. Our bottling partners' financial condition is affected in large part by conditions and events that are beyond our and their control, including competitive and general market conditions; the availability of capital and other financing resources on reasonable terms; loss of major customers; changes in or additional regulations; or disruptions of bottling operations that may be caused by strikes, work stoppages, labor unrest, natural disasters, international conflicts, acts of war, health epidemics, pandemics or other catastrophic events. A deterioration of the financial condition or results of operations of one or more of our major bottling partners could adversely affect our net operating revenues from sales of concentrates and syrups; and, if such deterioration involves one or more of our equity method investee bottling partners, it could also result in a decrease in our equity income and/or impairments of our equity method investments.\n\n## We may from time to time engage in refranchising activities or divestitures of certain brands or businesses, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\nAs part of our strategic initiative to focus on our core business of building brands and leading our system of bottling partners, we continue to seek opportunities to refranchise our consolidated bottling operations. Our refranchising activities require significant attention and effort on the part of, and therefore may be a distraction for, senior management. If we are unable to complete future refranchising transactions on terms and conditions favorable to us, or if our refranchising partners are not efficient or not aligned with our long-term vision for the Coca-Cola system, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Additionally, we have divested and may in the future divest certain brands or businesses. These divestitures may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition if we are unable to offset impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested brands or businesses, or if we are otherwise unable to achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from such divestitures.",

KO also notes the potential for product liability claims and negative publicity, which could cause its business to suffer. Target (TGT) states that changes in the legal or regulatory environment related to product safety and quality could increase its expenses, reduce consumer demand for its products, and result in litigation or regulatory proceedings, which could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. Both companies emphasize that these risks necessitate rigorous compliance and proactive risk management strategies to mitigate financial and reputational damage.",

Ongoing public concern about obesity; other health-related public concerns surrounding consumption of sweetened beverages; the effects or perceived effects of the usage of weight-loss drugs on consumption patterns; potential new or increased taxes on sweetened beverages by government entities to reduce consumption or to raise revenue; potential new or increased governmental regulations on particular ingredients or additives in our beverages and packaging, or on manufacturing processes; additional governmental regulations concerning the advertising, marketing, labeling, packaging or sale of our sweetened beverages; and negative publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against us or other companies in our industry relating to the marketing, labeling or sale of sweetened beverages may reduce demand for, or increase the cost of, our sweetened beverages, which could adversely affect our profitability.\n\n## If we do not address evolving consumer product and shopping preferences, our business could suffer.\n\nConsumer product preferences have evolved and continue to evolve as a result of, among other things, health, wellness and nutrition considerations, including concerns regarding caloric intake associated with sweetened beverages and the perceived undesirability of artificial ingredients or processing; concerns regarding the perceived health effects of, or location of origin of, ingredients, raw materials or substances in our products or packaging, including due to the results of thirdparty studies (whether or not scientifically valid); shifting consumer demographics; changes in consumer tastes and needs coupled with a rapid expansion of beverage options and delivery methods; changes in consumer lifestyles; concerns regarding the environmental, social and sustainability impact of ingredient sources, the product manufacturing process and our packaging; consumer emphasis on transparency related to ingredients we use in our products and collection and recyclability of, and amount of recycled content contained in, our packaging containers and other materials; concerns about the health and welfare of animals in our dairy supply chain; and competitive product and pricing pressures. In addition, in many of our markets, shopping patterns are being affected by the digital evolution, with consumers rapidly embracing shopping by way of mobile device applications, e-commerce retailers and e-commerce websites or platforms. If we fail to address changes in consumer product and shopping preferences, do not successfully anticipate and prepare for future changes in such preferences, or are ineffective or slow in developing and implementing appropriate digital transformation initiatives, our share of sales, revenue growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected.\n\n## Product safety and quality concerns could negatively affect our business.\n\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all of our products. We have rigorous product safety and quality standards that we expect our operations, bottling partners and contract manufacturers to meet. However, despite our strong commitment to product safety and quality, we or our bottling partners at times have not met, and may not always meet, these standards, particularly as we expand our product offerings through innovation or acquisitions into beverage categories, such as value-added dairy and plant-based beverages, that are beyond our traditional range of beverage products. We and our bottling partners have had, and may in the future need, to recall products if they become contaminated or adulterated by any means, or if they are mislabeled or do not meet applicable regulatory requirements. In addition, we or our bottling partners and products have been, and could continue to be, subject to inspection by federal, state and local authorities, which could result in the identification of product quality or safety issues. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time, and could also subject us to product liability claims and negative publicity, all of which could cause our business to suffer.\n\nPublic debate and concern about perceived negative health consequences of processing and of certain ingredients, such as nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners, color additives and biotechnology-derived substances, and of other substances present in our beverage products or packaging materials, may reduce demand for our beverage products or result in additional governmental regulation.\n\nPublic debate and concern about perceived negative health consequences of processing and of certain ingredients in our beverage products, such as synthetic colors, nutritive (e.g., sugar, HFCS) and non-nutritive sweeteners, biotechnology-derived substances and other additives; substances that are present in our beverage products naturally or that occur as a result of the manufacturing process, such as 4-methylimidazole (4-MEI), a chemical compound that is formed during the manufacturing of certain types of caramel coloring used in cola-flavored beverages; or substances used in packaging materials, such as bisphenol A (BPA), an odorless, tasteless food-grade chemical commonly used in the food and beverage industries as a component in the coating of the interior of cans, may affect consumers' preferences and cause them to shift away from some of our beverage",

These proceedings relate to a wide range of matters, including commercial disputes, employment, env ironmental, social, and gov ernance matters, intellectual property rights, personal injury, shareholder actions, securities claims, and matters relating to our compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

      "answer": "Coca-Cola identifies that weather conditions can affect the volume of sales in its beverage business, particularly during the second and third calendar quarters, which historically account for the highest sales volumes. This indicates that weather has a direct impact on its seasonal revenue generation, as demand for ready-to-drink beverages is closely tied to climatic factors. In contrast, Target discloses that weather conditions represent a risk to its administrative functions in Bangalore, India, which support various business operations. A disruption in these functions\u2014due to weather or other external events\u2014could adversely affect Target\u2019s operational efficiency, guest service levels, and overall financial performance.

          "chunk_text": "## Promotional and Marketing Programs\n\nIn addition to conducting our own independent advertising and marketing activities, we may provide promotional and marketing support and/or funds to our bottlers. In most cases, we do this on a discretionary basis under the terms of commitment letters or agreements, even though we are not obligated to do so under the terms of the bottler's agreements between our Company and the bottlers. Also, on a discretionary basis in most cases, our Company may develop and introduce new products, packages and equipment to assist the bottlers. Likewise, in many instances, we provide promotional and marketing support and/or funds and/or dispensing equipment and repair services to fountain and bottle/can retailers, typically pursuant to marketing agreements.\n\n## Investments in Bottling Operations\n\nMost of our branded beverage products are prepared, packaged, distributed and sold by independent bottling partners. However, from time to time we acquire or take control of a bottling operation, often in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance. Owning a bottling operation enables us to compensate for limited local resources; help focus the bottler's sales and marketing programs; assist in the development of the bottler's business and information systems; and establish an appropriate capital structure for the bottler. In line with our long-term bottling strategy, we may periodically consider options for divesting or reducing our ownership interest in a consolidated bottling operation, typically by selling all or a portion of our interest in the bottling operation to an independent bottler to improve Coca-Cola system efficiency. When we sell a consolidated bottling operation to an independent bottling partner in which we have an equity method investment, our Company continues to participate in the bottler's results of operations through our share of the equity method investee's earnings or losses.\n\nIn addition, from time to time we make equity investments representing noncontrolling interests in certain bottling operations with the intention of maximizing the strength and efficiency of the Coca-Cola system's production, marketing, sales and distribution capabilities around the world by providing expertise and resources to strengthen those businesses. These investments are intended to result in increases in unit case volume, net operating revenues and profits at the bottler level, which in turn generate increased sales for our Company's concentrate operations. When our equity investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee bottler's operating and financial policies, we account for the investment under the equity method.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nSales of our ready-to-drink beverages are somewhat seasonal, with the second and third calendar quarters historically accounting for the highest sales volumes. The volume of sales in the beverage business may be affected by weather conditions.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe commercial beverage industry is highly competitive and consists of numerous companies, ranging from small or emerging to very large and well established. These include companies that, like our Company, compete globally in multiple geographic areas, as well as businesses that are primarily regional or local in operation. Competitive products include numerous nonalcoholic sparkling soft drinks; water products, including flavored and enhanced waters; juices, juice drinks and nectars; dilutables (including syrups and powders); coffees; teas; energy drinks; sports drinks; milk and other dairy-based drinks; plant-based beverages; functional beverages, including vitamin-based products and relaxation beverages; and various other nonalcoholic beverages. These competitive products are sold to consumers in both ready-to-drink and non-ready-to-drink form. The Company has directly entered the alcohol beverage category in numerous markets outside the United States. In the United States, the Company has established a wholly owned, indirect, firewalled subsidiary, which uses third-party manufacturers and distributors to produce and sell alcohol products in certain regions of the United States and also authorizes alcohol-licensed third parties to use certain of our trademarks and related intellectual property on alcohol beverages that contain Company beverage bases. Competitive products include all alcohol ready-to-drink beverages containing various alcohol bases. In many of the countries in which we do business, PepsiCo, Inc. is a primary competitor. Other significant competitors include, but are not limited to, Nestl\u00e9 S.A., Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., Danone S.A., Suntory Beverage &amp; Food Limited, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Kirin Holdings, Heineken N.V., Diageo plc and Red Bull GmbH. We also compete against numerous regional and local companies and, increasingly, against smaller companies that are developing microbrands and selling them directly to consumers through e-commerce retailers and other e-commerce platforms. In addition, in some markets, we compete against retailers that have developed their own store or private-label beverage brands.\n\nCompetitive factors impacting our business include, but are not limited to, pricing, advertising, sales promotion programs,     in-store displays and point-of-sale marketing, digital marketing, product and ingredient innovation, availability, increased efficiency in production techniques, the introduction of new packaging as well as new vending and dispensing equipment, contracting with marketing assets (theaters, sports arenas, universities, etc.), and brand and trademark development and protection.",

We  believe  this  combination  provides  the  most efficient  method  of  marketing  for  these  types  of  products. Product  quality,  performance,  value  and  packaging  are  also important differentiating factors.\n\nGovernment Regulation .  Our Company is subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations across the countries in which we do business. In the United States, many of our products and manufacturing operations are subject to one or more federal or state  regulatory  agencies,  including  the  U.S.  Food  and  Drug Administration  (FDA),  the  Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA),  the  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Administration (OSHA),  the Federal  Trade  Commission  (FTC)  and  the Consumer  Product  Safety  Commission  (CPSC).  We  are  also subject  to  anti-corruption  laws  and  regulations,  such  as  the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and antitrust and competition laws and regulations that govern our dealings with suppliers, customers, competitors and government officials.\n\nIn addition, many  foreign  jurisdictions  in  which  we  do business  have  regulations  and  regulatory  bodies  that  govern similar aspects of our operations and products, in some cases to  an  even  more  significant  degree.  We  are  also  subject  to expanding  laws  and regulations related to  environmental protection and other sustainability-related matters, nonfinancial  reporting  and  diligence,  labor  and  employment, trade, taxation and data privacy and protection, including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  and  similar  regulations  in  states  within  the  United States  and  in  countries  around  the  world.  For  additional information  on  the  potential  impacts  of  global  legal  and regulatory  requirements  on  our  business,  see  'Item  1A.  Risk Factors' herein.\n\nThe Company has in place compliance programs and internal and external experts to help guide our business in complying with these and other existing laws and regulations that apply to us around the globe; and we have made, and plan to continue making,  necessary  expenditures  for  compliance  with  these laws and regulations. We also expect that our many suppliers, consultants and other third parties working on our behalf share our  commitment  to  compliance,  and  we  have  policies  and procedures in place to manage these relationships, though they inherently  involve  a  lesser  degree  of  control  over  operations and governance.  We  do  not expect that  the  Company's expenditures for compliance with current government regulations,  including  current  environmental  regulations,  will have  a material effect on  our total capital  expenditures, earnings or competitive position in fiscal year 2023  as compared to prior periods.\n\nHuman  Capital . Our employees are a key source of competitive advantage. Their actions, guided by our Purpose, Values  and  Principles  (PVPs),  are  critical  to  the  long-term success of our business. We  aim  to  retain our talented employees by offering competitive compensation and benefits, strong  career  development  and  a  respectful  and  inclusive culture that provides equal opportunity for all.\n\nOur  Board  of Directors, through the  Compensation  and Leadership  Development  Committee  (C&amp;LD  Committee), provides  oversight  of  the  Company's  policies  and  strategies relating to talent including diversity, equality and inclusion as well as the Company's compensation principles and practices. The  C&amp;LD  Committee  also  evaluates  and  approves the Company's compensation plans, policies and programs applicable to our senior executives.\n\n## Employees\n\nAs of June 30, 2022, the Company had approximately 106,000 employees,  an  increase  of  five  percent  versus  the  prior  year due primarily to business growth.  The total  number  of employees is an estimate of total Company  employees excluding interns, co-ops, contractors and employees of joint ventures.  49%  of  our  employees  are  in  manufacturing  roles and  26%  of  our  employees  are  located  in  the  United  States. 41% of our global employees are women. As of June 30, 2022, 28% of our U.S. employees identify as multicultural.\n\n## Training and Development\n\nWe focus on attracting,  developing  and  retaining  skilled  and diverse talent, both from universities and the broader market. We recruit from among the best universities across markets in which  we  compete  and  are  generally  able  to  select  from  the top talent. We  focus on developing our employees  by providing a variety of job experiences, training programs and skill  development  opportunities.  Given  our  develop-fromwithin model  for  staffing most  of our senior leadership positions, it is particularly important for us to ensure holistic growth and full engagement of our employees.\n\n## Diversity, Equality and Inclusion\n\nAs  a  consumer  products  company,  we  believe  that  it  is important  for  our  workforce  to  reflect  the  diversity  of  our consumers  worldwide.  We  also  seek  to  foster  an  inclusive work  environment  where  each  individual  can  bring  their authentic self, which helps drive innovation and enables us to better serve our consumers. We aspire to achieve equal gender representation globally and at key management and leadership levels. Within the U.S. workforce, our aspiration is to achieve 40% multicultural representation overall as well as at management and leadership levels.\n\n## Compensation and Benefits\n\nOur compensation plans are based on the principles of paying for performance, paying competitively versus peer companies that  we  compete  with  for  talent  and  in  the  marketplace  and focusing on long-term success through a combination of shortterm and long-term incentive programs. We also offer competitive benefit programs, including retirement plans and health  insurance  in  line  with  local  country  practices  with flexibility to accommodate the needs of a diverse workforce.\n\nSustainability .  Environmental  sustainability  is  a  key  focus area and integrated into P&amp;G's  business strategies.  The Company  has  declared  its  focus  on  developing  irresistibly superior  products  and  packages  that  are  sustainable.  The Company  announced  an  ambition  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas emissions,  purchase  renewable  electricity  for  our  operations, reduce  our use of virgin petroleum-based  plastic in  our packaging,  increase  the  recyclability  or  reusability  of  our packaging  and  increase  responsible  sourcing  of  key  forestbased commodities such as wood pulp and palm oil.",

The laws and regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: federal and state registration and regulation of pharmacies; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine; applicable governmental payer regulations including Medicare and Medicaid; data privacy and security laws and regulations including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the Affordable Care Act; laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances; regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA\") and the Drug Enforcement Administration (the \"DEA\"); trade regulations including those of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and consumer protection and safety regulations including those of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as state regulatory authorities, governing the availability, sale, advertisement and promotion of products we sell and the financial services we offer (including through our digital channels and stores and clubs as well as our previously announced fintech joint venture); antikickback laws; anti-money laundering laws; consumer financial protection laws; the Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations; false claims laws; patient inducement regulations; and federal and state laws governing health care fraud and abuse, quality and standards of medical equipment, and the qualifications and practice of the professions of medical, pharmacy, optical care and health care services.\n\nFor example, in the U.S., the DEA and various other regulatory authorities regulate the purchase, distribution, maintenance and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. We are required to hold valid DEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale, dispensing, disposal and holding of controlled substances. The DEA, the FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. In addition, other health-related legislation at the federal and state level may have an adverse effect on our business or require us to modify certain aspects of our operations. Also, upon the successful completion of the previously announced pending acquisitions by our fintech joint venture, there may be an increased degree of scrutiny by financial regulatory authorities over the newly acquired fintech related businesses, which may result in higher operational costs and an increased possibility for fines and penalties if there is non-compliance with the applicable laws and regulations.\n\nWe are also governed by foreign, national and state laws and regulations of general applicability, including laws and regulations related to working conditions, health and safety, equal employment opportunity, employee benefit and other labor and employment matters, laws and regulations related to competition and antitrust matters, and health and wellness related regulations for our pharmacy operations outside of the U.S. Increasing governmental and societal attention to ESG matters, including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting diligence, and disclosure topics such as climate change, sustainability (including with respect to our supply chain), natural resources, waste reduction, energy, human capital, and risk oversight could expand the nature, scope, and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess, and report. In addition, certain financial services we offer or make available are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, including those intended to help detect and prevent money laundering, fraud and other illicit activity as well as consumer financial protections laws and U.S. sanctions. We are also subject to data privacy and protection laws regulating the collection, use, retention, disclosure, transfer and processing of personal information, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\"), which was significantly modified by the California Privacy Rights Act (\"CPRA\"), new comprehensive privacy legislation passed in 2021 in Virginia and Colorado, as well as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") and China's Personal Information Protection Act. The potential effects of these laws are farreaching and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply. In the case of non-compliance with a material provision of the GDPR (such as non-adherence to the core principles of processing personal data), regulators have the authority to levy a fine in an amount that is up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of global annual turnover in the prior year. These administrative fines are discretionary and based, in each case, on a multi-factored approach. Residents in jurisdictions with comprehensive privacy laws have expanded rights to access, correct and require deletion of their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA and CPRA provide for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches. Furthermore, our marketing and customer engagement activities are subject to communications privacy laws such as the Telephone Consumer",

      "answer": "Walmart International generated $101.0 billion in net sales during fiscal 2022, which represented 18% of Walmart\u2019s total consolidated net sales. This figure is strategically important for Procter & Gamble because PG depends on grocery stores as a major retail channel for product distribution, and Walmart operates a large global footprint in this space through formats such as supercenters, supermarkets, and eCommerce platforms like walmart.com.mx and flipkart.com. Since PG competes in highly competitive consumer staples markets, understanding Walmart\u2019s international scale and omni-channel integration helps PG strategize around pricing, promotional incentives, and trade terms to maintain or grow its market share in these key retail environments.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize: Since Walmart is a dominant global retailer in grocery and omni-channel formats, and PG relies on such channels for product distribution, the $101.0 billion figure reflects a major portion of the competitive retail environment PG must navigate to maintain its market position internationally."

Inflation pressures could also result in increases in these input costs. Therefore, our business results  depend,  in  part,  on  our  continued  ability  to  manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost saving projects and  sourcing  decisions,  while  maintaining  and  improving margins and market share. Failure to manage these fluctuations  could  adversely  impact  our  results  of  operations or cash flows.\n\n## The ability to achieve our business objectives depends on how  well  we  can  compete  with  our  local  and  global competitors in new and existing markets and channels.\n\nThe consumer products industry is highly competitive. Across all  of  our  categories,  we  compete  against  a  wide  variety  of global  and  local  competitors.  As  a  result,  we  experience ongoing  competitive  pressures  in  the  environments  in  which we  operate,  which  may  result  in  challenges  in  maintaining sales and profit margins. To address these challenges, we must be  able  to  successfully  respond  to  competitive  factors  and emerging retail trends, including pricing, promotional incentives,  product  delivery  windows  and  trade  terms.  In addition,  evolving  sales  channels  and  business  models  may affect  customer  and  consumer  preferences  as  well  as  market dynamics,  which,  for  example,  may  be  seen  in  the  growing consumer preference for shopping online, ease of competitive entry  into  certain  categories  and  growth  in  hard  discounter channels. Failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends and effectively compete in growing  sales  channels  and  business  models,  particularly  ecommerce and mobile or social commerce applications, could negatively impact our results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## A significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business.\n\nWe  sell  most  of  our  products  via  retail  customers,  which include  mass  merchandisers,  e-commerce  (including  social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty  beauty  stores  (including  airport  duty-free  stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores  and professional  channels.  Our  success  depends  on  our  ability  to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers, which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business, and our business performance could suffer if we cannot  reach  agreement  with  a  key  customer  on  trade  terms and principles. Our business could also be negatively impacted if  a  key  customer  were  to  significantly  reduce  the  inventory level of or shelf space allocated to our products as a result of increased  offerings  of  other  branded  manufacturers,  private label brands and generic non-branded products or for other reasons,  significantly  tighten  product  delivery  windows  or experience a significant business disruption.\n\n## If  the  reputation  of  the  Company  or  one  or  more  of  our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results.\n\nThe Company's reputation, and the reputation  of  our  brands, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including consumers, customers and suppliers. The quality and safety of our products are critical to our business. Many of our brands have worldwide recognition and  our  financial  success  directly  depends  on  the  success  of our  brands.  The  success  of  our  brands  can  suffer  if  our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. Our results of operations or cash flows could also  be negatively  impacted  if  the  Company  or  one  of  our  brands suffers  substantial  harm  to  its  reputation  due  to  a  significant product recall, product-related litigation, defects or impurities in our products, product misuse, changing consumer perceptions  of  certain  ingredients,  negative  perceptions  of packaging (such as plastic and other petroleumbased materials), lack of recyclability or other environmental impacts, concerns about actual or alleged labor or equality and inclusion practices, privacy lapses or data breaches, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products.  Additionally,  negative  or  inaccurate  postings  or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage  the reputation of our brands or the Company.  If  we  are  unable  to  effectively  manage  real  or perceived  issues,  including  concerns  about  safety,  quality, ingredients, efficacy, environmental or social impacts or similar matters, sentiments toward the  Company  or  our products  could  be  negatively  impacted,  and  our  results  of operations  or  cash  flows  could  suffer.  Our  Company  also devotes  time  and  resources  to  citizenship  efforts  that  are consistent  with  our  corporate  values  and  are  designed  to strengthen our business and protect and preserve our reputation,  including  programs  driving  ethics  and  corporate responsibility, strong communities, equality and inclusion and environmental  sustainability.  While  the  Company  has  many programs and initiatives  to  further  these  goals,  our  ability  to achieve  these  goals  is  impacted  in  part  by  the  actions  and efforts of third parties including local and other governmental authorities, suppliers, vendors and customers. If these programs  are  not  executed  as  planned  or  suffer  negative publicity,  the  Company's  reputation  and  results  of  operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted.\n\n## We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.\n\nDue to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with third parties, including our suppliers, contract  manufacturers,  distributors,  contractors,  commercial banks,  joint  venture  partners  and  external  business  partners, for  certain  functions.  If  we  are  unable  to  effectively  manage our third-party relationships and the agreements under which our third-party partners operate, our results of operations and cash  flows  could  be  adversely  impacted.

          "chunk_text": "Walmart Argentina in fiscal 2021 and operated in the United Kingdom and Japan prior to the sale of those operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Refer to Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent divestitures.\n\nWalmart International includes numerous formats divided into two major categories: retail and wholesale. These categories consist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs) and cash &amp; carry, as well as eCommerce through walmart.com.mx, walmart.ca, flipkart.com and other sites. Walmart International had net sales of $101.0 billion for fiscal 2022, representing 18% of our fiscal 2022 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $121.4 billion and $120.1 billion for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. The gross profit rate is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its format mix.\n\nWalmart International's strategy is to create strong local businesses powered by Walmart which means being locally relevant and customer-focused in each of the markets it operates. We are being deliberate about where and how we choose to operate and continue to re-shape the portfolio to best enable long-term, sustainable and profitable growth. As such, we have taken certain strategic actions to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, which include the following highlights over the last three years:\n\n- Divestiture of Walmart Argentina in November 2020.\n- Divestiture of Asda Group Limited (\"Asda\"), our retail operations in the U.K., in February 2021.\n- Divestiture of a majority stake in Seiyu, our retail operations in Japan, in March 2021.\n\nOmni-channel. Walmart International provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce, such as through pickup and delivery services in most of our markets, our marketplaces such as Flipkart in India, and a digital transaction platform anchored in payments such as PhonePe in India. Same-day delivery capacity continues to expand in Mexico, including our recent launch of a membership model which provides unlimited same-day delivery from stores, and in China, our partnerships with JD.com and JD Daojia provide customers one-hour delivery by leveraging Walmart stores as fulfillment centers. A value-based internet and telephone service was recently launched in Mexico allowing customers to enjoy digital connectivity.\n\nGenerally, retail units' selling areas range in size from 1,400 square feet to 186,000 square feet. Our wholesale stores' selling areas generally range in size from 24,000 square feet to 158,000 square feet. As of January 31, 2022, Walmart International had approximately 2,900 pickup and over 1,900 delivery locations.\n\nMerchandise. The merchandising strategy for Walmart International is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and developed market specific private brands to serve our customers with high quality, low priced items. Along with the private brands we market globally, such as \"Equate,\" \"George,\" \"Great Value,\" \"Holiday Time,\" \"Mainstays,\" \"Marketside\" and \"Parent's Choice,\" our international markets have developed market specific brands including \"Aurrera,\" \"Cambridge,\" \"Extra Special,\" \"Lider,\" \"Myntra,\" and \"PhonePe.\" In addition, we have developed and continue to grow our relationships with regional and local suppliers in each market to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at low prices.\n\nWalmart International also offers advertising, financial services and related products in various markets. Our businesses in Mexico and Canada, for example, offer prepaid cards and money transfers, and our PhonePe business in India provides a platform that offers mobile and bill payment, person-to-person (P2P) payment, investment and insurance solutions, financial services and advertising. Combined, these offerings did not represent a significant portion of annual segment revenues.\n\nOperations. The hours of operation for operating units in Walmart International vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. Consistent with its strategy, Walmart International continues to develop technology tools and services to better serve customers and help its various formats operate more efficiently, as well as to provide convenient and seamless omni-channel shopping experiences.\n\nSeasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart International's business is seasonal to a certain extent. Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns.\n\nCompetition. Walmart International competes with brick and mortar, eCommerce, and omni-channel retailers who operate department, drug, discount, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, cash &amp; carry operations and convenience stores, and eCommerce retailers, as well as catalog businesses. Our ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omnichannel experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We believe price leadership is a critical part of our business model and we continue to focus on moving our markets towards an EDLP approach. Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant impact on our competitive position in the markets where we operate. Each of these landscapes is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and new business models and the entry of new, well-funded competitors continue to intensify this competition. Some of our competitors have longer histories",

      "answer": "Procter & Gamble (PG) sells approximately 15% of its total sales to Walmart (WMT), making WMT one of PG\u2019s most significant customers. Since WMT competes with other grocery stores and operates under intense competitive pressure in the retail space, PG\u2019s financial performance becomes indirectly tied to the competitive dynamics of the grocery retail sector. WMT\u2019s ability to maintain market share and pricing power affects its purchasing behavior and demand for PG\u2019s products.

Business.\n\nThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company (the Company) is focused on providing  branded  products  of  superior  quality  and  value  to improve  the  lives  of  the  world's  consumers,  now  and  for generations to come. The Company was incorporated in Ohio in 1905,  having  first  been  established  as  a  New  Jersey corporation in 1890, and was built from a business founded in Cincinnati  in  1837  by  William  Procter  and  James  Gamble. Today,  our  products  are  sold  in  approximately  180  countries and territories.\n\nAdditional  information  required  by  this  item  is  incorporated herein by reference to Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&amp;A);  and  Notes  1  and  2  to  our  Consolidated  Financial Statements. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms the  \"Company,\"  \"P&amp;G,\"  \"we,\"  \"our\"  or  \"us\"  as  used  herein refer to The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (the registrant) and its subsidiaries.\n\nThroughout  this  Form  10-K,  we  incorporate  by  reference information  from  other  documents  filed  with  the  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe  Company's  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K,  quarterly reports  on  Form  10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments thereto, are filed electronically with the SEC. The SEC maintains an internet site that  contains  these  reports  at: www.sec.gov. Reports can also be accessed through links from our website at: www.pginvestor.com. P&amp;G  includes the website  link  solely  as  a  textual  reference.  The  information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into this report.\n\nCopies of these reports are also available, without charge, by contacting EQ  Shareowner  Services, 1100  Centre Pointe Curve, Suite 101, Mendota, MN 55120-4100.\n\n## Financial Information about Segments\n\nInformation about our reportable segments can be found in the MD&amp;A and Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Narrative Description of Business\n\nBusiness Model .  Our business model relies on the continued growth and success of existing brands and products, as well as the  creation  of  new  innovative  products  and  brands.  The markets and industry segments in which we offer our products are highly competitive. Our products are sold in approximately 180  countries  and  territories  through  numerous  channels  as well  as  direct-to-consumer.  Our  growth  strategy  is  to  deliver meaningful and noticeable superiority across five key vectors of our consumer proposition -product performance, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and consumer  and  customer  value.  We  use  our  research  and development (R&amp;D) and consumer insights to provide superior products and packaging. We utilize our marketing and online  presence  to  deliver  superior  brand  messaging  to  our consumers.  We  work  collaboratively  with  our  customers  to deliver  superior  retail  execution,  both  in-store  and  online.  In conjunction with the above vectors, we provide superior value to consumers and our retail customers in each price tier in which we  compete.  Productivity  improvement  is  also  critical  to delivering  our  objectives  of  balanced  top  and  bottom-line growth and value creation.\n\nKey Product Categories . Information on key product categories  can  be  found  in  the  MD&amp;A  and  Note  2  to  our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nKey Customers .  Our customers include mass merchandisers, e-commerce  (including  social  commerce)  channels,  grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors,  wholesalers,  specialty  beauty  stores  (including airport  duty-free  stores),  high-frequency  stores,  pharmacies, electronics  stores  and  professional  channels.  We  also  sell direct  to  consumers.  Sales  to  Walmart  Inc.  and  its  affiliates represent approximately 15% of our total sales in 2022, 2021 and 2020. No other customer represents more than 10% of our total sales. Our top ten customers accounted for approximately 39% of our total sales in 2022, 39% in 2021 and 38% in 2020.\n\nSources and Availability of Materials . Almost all of the raw and packaging materials used by the Company are purchased from third parties, some of whom are single-source suppliers. We  produce  certain  raw  materials,  primarily  chemicals,  for further  use  in  the  manufacturing  process.  In  addition,  fuel, natural gas and derivative products are important commodities consumed in our manufacturing processes and in the transportation  of  input  materials  and  finished  products.  The prices we pay for materials and other commodities are subject to fluctuation. When prices for these items change, we may or may  not  pass  the  change  to  our  customers.  The  Company purchases  a  substantial  variety  of  other  raw  and  packaging materials, none of which are material to our business taken as a whole.\n\nTrademarks  and  Patents .  We  own  or  have  licenses  under patents and registered trademarks, which are used in connection with our activity in all businesses. Some of these patents  or  licenses  cover  significant  product  formulation  and processes  used  to  manufacture  our  products.  The  trademarks are  important  to  the  overall  marketing  and  branding  of  our products. All major trademarks in each business are registered. In  part,  our  success  can  be  attributed  to  the  existence  and continued protection of these trademarks, patents and licenses.\n\nCompetitive Condition .  The  markets  in  which  our  products are sold are highly competitive. Our products compete against similar products of many large and small companies, including well-known  global  competitors.  In  many  of  the  markets  and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against  other  branded  products  as  well  as  retailers'  privatelabel brands. We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant  market  share  position.  We  support  our  products with advertising, promotions and other marketing vehicles to build awareness",

          "chunk_text": "Walmart Argentina in fiscal 2021 and operated in the United Kingdom and Japan prior to the sale of those operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Refer to Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent divestitures.\n\nWalmart International includes numerous formats divided into two major categories: retail and wholesale. These categories consist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs) and cash &amp; carry, as well as eCommerce through walmart.com.mx, walmart.ca, flipkart.com and other sites. Walmart International had net sales of $101.0 billion for fiscal 2022, representing 18% of our fiscal 2022 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $121.4 billion and $120.1 billion for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. The gross profit rate is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its format mix.\n\nWalmart International's strategy is to create strong local businesses powered by Walmart which means being locally relevant and customer-focused in each of the markets it operates. We are being deliberate about where and how we choose to operate and continue to re-shape the portfolio to best enable long-term, sustainable and profitable growth. As such, we have taken certain strategic actions to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, which include the following highlights over the last three years:\n\n- Divestiture of Walmart Argentina in November 2020.\n- Divestiture of Asda Group Limited (\"Asda\"), our retail operations in the U.K., in February 2021.\n- Divestiture of a majority stake in Seiyu, our retail operations in Japan, in March 2021.\n\nOmni-channel. Walmart International provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce, such as through pickup and delivery services in most of our markets, our marketplaces such as Flipkart in India, and a digital transaction platform anchored in payments such as PhonePe in India. Same-day delivery capacity continues to expand in Mexico, including our recent launch of a membership model which provides unlimited same-day delivery from stores, and in China, our partnerships with JD.com and JD Daojia provide customers one-hour delivery by leveraging Walmart stores as fulfillment centers. A value-based internet and telephone service was recently launched in Mexico allowing customers to enjoy digital connectivity.\n\nGenerally, retail units' selling areas range in size from 1,400 square feet to 186,000 square feet. Our wholesale stores' selling areas generally range in size from 24,000 square feet to 158,000 square feet. As of January 31, 2022, Walmart International had approximately 2,900 pickup and over 1,900 delivery locations.\n\nMerchandise. The merchandising strategy for Walmart International is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and developed market specific private brands to serve our customers with high quality, low priced items. Along with the private brands we market globally, such as \"Equate,\" \"George,\" \"Great Value,\" \"Holiday Time,\" \"Mainstays,\" \"Marketside\" and \"Parent's Choice,\" our international markets have developed market specific brands including \"Aurrera,\" \"Cambridge,\" \"Extra Special,\" \"Lider,\" \"Myntra,\" and \"PhonePe.\" In addition, we have developed and continue to grow our relationships with regional and local suppliers in each market to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at low prices.\n\nWalmart International also offers advertising, financial services and related products in various markets. Our businesses in Mexico and Canada, for example, offer prepaid cards and money transfers, and our PhonePe business in India provides a platform that offers mobile and bill payment, person-to-person (P2P) payment, investment and insurance solutions, financial services and advertising. Combined, these offerings did not represent a significant portion of annual segment revenues.\n\nOperations. The hours of operation for operating units in Walmart International vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. Consistent with its strategy, Walmart International continues to develop technology tools and services to better serve customers and help its various formats operate more efficiently, as well as to provide convenient and seamless omni-channel shopping experiences.\n\nSeasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart International's business is seasonal to a certain extent. Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns.\n\nCompetition. Walmart International competes with brick and mortar, eCommerce, and omni-channel retailers who operate department, drug, discount, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, cash &amp; carry operations and convenience stores, and eCommerce retailers, as well as catalog businesses. Our ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omnichannel experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We believe price leadership is a critical part of our business model and we continue to focus on moving our markets towards an EDLP approach. Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant impact on our competitive position in the markets where we operate. Each of these landscapes is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and new business models and the entry of new, well-funded competitors continue to intensify this competition. Some of our competitors have longer histories",

      "question": "How do PG's and MDLZ's share-based compensation approaches differ in terms of share authorization and vesting mechanisms for performance-based awards?",
      "answer": "PG's share-based compensation plan, approved by shareholders in 2019, authorizes a maximum of 150 million shares of common stock for issuance, with 77 million shares remaining available for grant as of 2023. In contrast, MDLZ does not specify a maximum number of shares authorized for issuance in its filing, but it does describe vesting mechanisms for performance-based awards, such as PSUs, which vest based on varying performance, market, and service conditions and can result in a final award of 0-200% of the target grant. PG's PSUs also include a Relative Total Shareholder Return (R-TSR) modifier, which adjusts the number of shares granted based on the company's shareholder return relative to its consumer products peer set, while MDLZ's PSUs rely on Monte Carlo simulation for market-based components and the market price of its stock for performance-based components.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - MDLZ describes its share-based compensation plan, noting that PSUs vest based on performance, market, and service conditions, with a final award ranging from 0-200% of the target grant. The Monte Carlo simulation model is used for market-based components, while the market price of the company's stock is used for performance-based components.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - PG outlines its share-based compensation plan, which was approved by shareholders in 2019. It specifies that a maximum of 150 million shares of common stock were authorized for issuance, with 77 million shares remaining available for grant as of 2023. PG's PSUs include a Relative Total Shareholder Return (R-TSR) modifier that adjusts the award based on the company's shareholder return relative to its peers.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Comparing the two plans, PG provides a specific share authorization limit (150 million shares) and remaining availability (77 million), while MDLZ does not specify such limits. Both companies use PSUs with vesting tied to performance and market conditions, but PG's plan includes a unique R-TSR modifier for peer comparison, whereas MDLZ relies on Monte Carlo simulation for market-based components."

      "answer": "MDLZ faces significant volatility in commodity prices such as cocoa and dairy due to global competition for resources, which directly affects its input costs and profitability. In contrast, PG operates in highly competitive markets but is often in a leadership position with a diversified product portfolio and strong branding, allowing it to better navigate competitive pressures without direct mention of commodity cost sensitivity. Therefore, while both companies face global competition, MDLZ is more directly exposed to input price fluctuations, whereas PG's competitive strength lies in brand positioning and market share, which buffers it from some of the raw material volatility faced by MDLZ.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from MDLZ_10k_2023.pdf - MDLZ uses large quantities of commodities such as cocoa, dairy, wheat, and edible oils, and faces cost volatility due to global competition for resources.",

MO, on the other hand, emphasizes cybersecurity-related internal control risks, specifically the increased exposure due to the use of artificial intelligence by bad actors and third-party vendors, which could lead to data breaches or regulatory noncompliance.

          "chunk_text": "Commission, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, regulate different aspects of our business, along with parallel authorities at the state and local levels and comparable authorities overseas. In addition, our selling practices are regulated by competition law authorities in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nNew or more stringent legal or regulatory requirements, or more restrictive interpretations of ex isting requirements, could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For example, from time to time, various regulatory authorities around the world review the use of various ingredients and packaging content in consumer products. While we monitor and seek to mitigate the impact of any emerging information, a decision by a regulatory or governmental authority that any ingredient or packaging content in our products should be restricted or should otherwise be newly regulated could adversely impact our business and reputation, as could negative reactions by our consumers, trade customers or non-governmental organizations to our current or prior use of such ingredients or packaging. Additionally, an inability to develop new or reformulated products containing alternative ingredients, to obtain regulatory approval of such products or ingredients on a timely basis or to effectively market and sell such products could likewise adversely affect our business.\n\nBecause of our extensive international operations, we could be adversely affected by violations of worldwide anti-bribery laws, including those that prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and laws that prohibit commercial bribery. We are also subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the U.S. (including, without limitation, those imposed by OFAC) and/or by other jurisdictions that may prohibit us or certain of our affiliates from doing business in certain countries, or restrict the kind of business that may be conducted. While our policies mandate compliance with these laws, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, joint venture partners or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation and our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nWhile it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business, findings that we are in violation of, or out of compliance with, applicable laws or regulations have subjected us to, and could subject us to, civil remedies, including fines, damages, injunctions or product recalls, or criminal sanctions, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Even if a claim is unsuccessful, is without merit or is not fully pursued, the cost of responding to such a claim, including management time and out-ofpocket expenses, and the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products, processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation, brand image and our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For information regarding our legal and regulatory matters, see Item 3 'Legal Proceedings' and Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Legal claims and proceedings could adversely impact our business.\n\nAs a global company serving consumers in more than 200 countries and territories, we are and may continue to be subject to a wide variety of legal claims and proceedings, including disputes relating to intellectual property, contracts, product liability, marketing, advertising, foreign ex change controls, antitrust and trade regulation, as well as labor and employment, pension, data privacy and security, environmental and tax matters and consumer class actions. Regardless of their merit, these claims can require significant time and expense to investigate and defend. Since litigation is inherently uncertain, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or proceedings, or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters, including any reserves taken in connection therewith, will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such matters. In addition, if one of our products, or an ingredient contained in our products, is perceived or found to be defective, or unsafe or have a quality issue, we have had to and may in the future need to withdraw, recall or reformulate some of our products. Whether or not a legal claim or proceeding is successful, or a withdrawal, recall or reformulation is required or advisable, such assertions could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the negative publicity surrounding them could harm our reputation and brand image. The resolution of, or increase in the reserves taken in connection with, one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition for that period. See Item 3 'Legal Proceedings' and Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on certain of our legal claims and proceedings.",

To date, we have not experienced any interruptions of these information systems as a result of infiltration attempts. However, because technology is increasingly complex and cyberattacks are increasingly sophisticated and more frequent, there can be no assurance that such incidents will not cause interruptions that could have a material adverse effect on us in the future. For ex ample, the rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies may intensify our and our service providers', key suppliers' and trade customers' cybersecurity risks. Bad actors around the world use increasingly sophisticated methods, including the use of artificial intelligence, to engage in illegal activities involving the theft and misuse of personal information, confidential information and intellectual property. Any of these outcomes could damage our reputation, result in the loss of valuable property and information and adversely impact our business.\n\nOutsourcing certain business functions pursuant to the Initiative may increase our exposure to risks such as data breaches, which could compromise sensitive information. Implementation of new technology and systems deployment may increase our risk of data security incidents, internal control failures and regulatory noncompliance. Our vendors and third-party partners may incorporate artificial intelligence tools into their offerings with or without disclosing this use to us. The providers of these artificial intelligence tools may not meet ex isting or rapidly evolving regulatory or industry standards concerning privacy and data protection, which may result in a loss of intellectual property or confidential information or cause harm to our reputation and the public perception of the effectiveness of our security measures. Failure of our, or our service providers', key suppliers' or trade customers', information systems to function as intended, or cyber-attacks or security breaches, could result in loss of revenue, assets, personal data, intellectual property, trade secrets or other sensitive and confidential data, financial misstatements, violation of applicable privacy and data security laws, reputational harm to our operating companies and their brands, operational disruptions, legal challenges and significant remediation and other costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\n## Our failure, or the failure of our service providers, key suppliers or trade customers, to comply with personal data protection, privacy, artificial intelligence and information security laws could materially adversely affect our business.\n\nWe and our service providers, key suppliers and trade customers are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions regarding personal data protection, privacy, artificial intelligence and information security.\n\nThese laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country or, within the United States, from state to state, and can create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. For example, as our business expands internationally and we outsource certain business functions to vendors in foreign jurisdictions as part of the Initiative, we may incur additional costs associated with compliance with foreign data protection laws and incur additional risk of noncompliance with such laws. Privacy laws and regulations are also expanding in the United States. Comprehensive state privacy laws are either in effect or have been enacted in a number of states, and similar laws are being considered in several other states, as well as at the federal and local levels. Our efforts, and the efforts of our service providers, key suppliers and trade customers, to comply with the evolving patchwork of differing foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to continue to increase over time, particularly as additional jurisdictions adopt similar regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations or to otherwise protect personal data from unauthorized access, use or other processing, could result in litigation, claims, regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations, damage to our reputation, fines, penalties and business disruptions, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\n## Risks Relating to Our Investments in Equity Securities\n\n## The expected benefits of our investment in ABI may not materialize in the expected manner or timeframe or at all, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position or earnings.\n\nThe expected benefits of our investment in ABI may not materialize in the expected manner or timeframe or at all, including due to foreign currency exchange rates; ABI's business results; ABI's share price; impairment losses on the value of our investment; our incurrence of additional tax liabilities related to our investment in ABI; and potential reductions in the number of directors that we can have appointed to the ABI board of directors.\n\nWe account for our investment in ABI under the equity method of accounting. For purposes of financial reporting, the earnings from and carrying value of our investment in ABI are translated into U.S. dollars ('USD') from various local currencies. In addition, ABI pays dividends in euros, which we convert into USD. During times of a strengthening USD against these currencies, our reported earnings from and carrying value of our investment in ABI will be reduced because these currencies will translate into fewer USD and the dividends that we receive from ABI will convert into fewer USD. Dividends and earnings from and carrying value of our investment in ABI are also subject to the risks encountered by ABI in its business, its business outlook, cash flow requirements and financial performance, the state of the market and the general economic climate. For example, in 2020, as a result of the uncertainty, volatility and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ABI's business, ABI reduced by 50% its final 2019 dividend paid in the second quarter of",

During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company redeemed at maturity $500 of ten-year Medium-Term Notes with a fixed coupon of 3.25%. The redemption was financed with commercial paper borrowings. In March 2023, the Company issued $500 of three-year Senior Notes at a fixed coupon rate of 4.800%, $500 of five-year Senior Notes at a fixed coupon rate of 4.600% and $500 of ten-year Senior Notes at a fixed coupon rate of 4.600%.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of $3,725 (including under the facility discussed below) and could also issue long-term debt pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. In November 2022, the Company entered into an amended and restated $3,000 five-year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks for a five-year term expiring November 2027, which replaced, on substantially similar terms, the Company's $3,000 revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire in August 2026.

We used the proceeds from the ABI Transaction to fund the ASR transactions discussed below.\n\nNJOY Contingent Payments - In the second quarter of 2024, the FDA issued MGOs for four NJOY e-vapor menthol products. As a result, we became obligated to make cash payments totaling $250 million under the acquisition agreement, which we made in July 2024. For further discussion on the NJOY contingent payments, see Note 3 .\n\nIn October 2023, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, under which we may offer debt securities or warrants to purchase debt securities from time to time over a three-year period from the date of filing.\n\n## Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Future Contractual Obligations\n\nWe had no off-balance sheet arrangements, including special purpose entities, other than guarantees and contractual obligations that are discussed below.\n\nGuarantees and Other Similar Matters - As discussed in Note 20, we had unused letters of credit obtained in the ordinary course of business and guarantees (including third-party guarantees) outstanding at December 31, 2024. From time to time, we also issue lines of credit to affiliated entities. As further discussed in Note 5. Supplier Financing to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, as part of the supplier financing program, Altria guarantees the financial obligations of ALCS under the financing program agreement. In addition, as discussed below in Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information and in Note 11, PM USA guarantees our obligations under our outstanding debt securities, any borrowings under our Credit Agreement and any amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. These items have not had, and are not expected to have, a significant impact on our liquidity.\n\nLong-Term Debt and Interest on Borrowings - In addition to maturities of long-term debt, we make interest payments based on stated coupon interest rates. For information on annual debt maturities and interest payments, see Note 11.\n\nPurchase Obligations - We have entered into purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and services, contract manufacturing, packaging, storage and distribution) and other commitments for projected needs to be used in the normal course of business. Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fix ed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). At December 31, 2024, purchase obligations for inventory and production costs for the next 12 months were $0.8 billion and $2.3 billion thereafter.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had $0.9 billion of other purchase obligation commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services, which occur through the ordinary course of business. The majority of these commitments are expected to be satisfied within 12 months. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2024 and are excluded from the amounts above.\n\nPayments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation - PM USA has entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states, the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories that call for certain payments. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. For further discussion of State Settlement Agreements, see Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation in Note 20.\n\nBased on current agreements, estimated annual industry volume decline rates, estimated operating income, estimated market share and inflation, the estimated amounts that we may charge to cost of sales for payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are $3.0 billion on average for the next three years. This estimate no longer includes PM USA's obligations under the State Settlement Agreements to make quarterly payments with respect to settling plaintiffs' attorneys' fees due to the termination of these obligations in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, the amount ex cludes the potential impact of any NPM Adjustment Items.\n\nThe estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in April of the following year. The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred. We paid approximately $3.9 billion and $4.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees, which are primarily paid in the second quarter of each period. The payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, market share and inflation. The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the ex tent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results. For further discussion on the potential impact of inflation on future payments, see Operating Results by Business Segment - Business Environment - State Settlement Agreements above.\n\nLitigation-Related Deposits and Payments - With respect to certain adverse verdicts currently on appeal, to obtain stays of judgments pending appeals, as of December 31, 2024, PM USA had posted appeal bonds totaling $31 million, which have been collateralized with restricted cash that is included in assets on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\nLitigation is subject to uncertainty, and an adverse outcome or settlement of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year, as more fully disclosed in Note 20, Item 3 and Item 1A.",

      "question": "Given the shared dependency on raw material suppliers and the specific risks described in both Colgate-Palmolive's and Philip Morris International's 2024 10-K filings, how would a 10% increase in global raw material costs impact gross margin percentages for both companies, considering Colgate's concerns about supplier financial difficulties and Philip Morris's exposure to tobacco and component part price volatility?",
      "answer": "A 10% increase in global raw material costs would likely compress gross margin percentages for both Colgate-Palmolive and Philip Morris International due to their shared supply chain vulnerabilities. Colgate-Palmolive specifically notes in its 2024 10-K that economic conditions can cause suppliers to suffer financial or operational difficulties, impacting their ability to provide raw materials in a timely manner or at all. This uncertainty would amplify the margin pressure from higher material costs, as alternative sourcing could be more expensive or unavailable. Philip Morris highlights its exposure to price volatility in tobacco and other component parts like wood tips and aluminum, which are critical to its cigar and smoke-free products. With reduced demand already causing supply constraints and increased costs for tobacco leaf, a further 10% increase in raw material prices would exacerbate these challenges. Both companies would face downward pressure on gross margins, with Colgate potentially experiencing margin contraction due to supplier instability and MO facing compounded cost increases in key inputs like tobacco and packaging materials.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Colgate-Palmolive notes that economic conditions can cause suppliers to face financial difficulties, impacting the timely or full provision of raw materials.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Philip Morris International cites specific raw material concerns, including tobacco leaf, wood tips, and aluminum, all of which are critical to its product lines and subject to price volatility.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies depend on stable and affordable raw material supplies. A 10% cost increase would directly affect their cost of goods sold, compressing gross margins. Colgate\u2019s risk of supplier instability compounds the issue, while MO\u2019s reliance on specific agricultural commodities and packaging materials heightens exposure to price fluctuations.",
        "Step 4: Calculate impact - Assuming current gross margins are approximately 55% for CL and 60% for MO, a 10% raw material cost increase (assuming raw materials represent ~30% of COGS for CL and ~35% for MO), would reduce gross margin by approximately 3 percentage points for CL and 3.5 percentage points for MO."

          "chunk_text": "## Financial and Economic Risks\n\n## Uncertain or unfavorable global economic conditions may adversely affect our business.\n\nUncertain or unfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business. Unfavorable global economic conditions, such as a recession, an economic slowdown, inflation, higher interest rates and/or reduced category growth rates, including as a result of the war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East, have negatively impacted and/or could negatively impact our business and result in declining revenues, profitability and/or cash flows. Although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands and market our products at multiple price points, during periods of economic uncertainty or unfavorable economic conditions, consumers may have less consumer confidence, reduce consumption or discretionary spending and/or change their purchasing patterns by foregoing purchasing certain of our products or by switching to 'private label,' or lower-priced product offerings. These changes could reduce demand for our products or result in a shift in our product mix, as consumers may choose products that sell at lower prices. Additionally, our retailers may be impacted and they may increase pressure on our selling prices or increase promotional activity for lower-priced or value offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes and margins. Furthermore, economic conditions can cause our customers, suppliers, distributors, contract manufacturers, logistics providers or other third-party partners to suffer financial or operational difficulties, which may impact their ability to buy our products or provide us with or distribute finished product, raw and packaging materials and/or services in a timely manner or at all. In addition, we could face difficulty collecting or recovering accounts receivables from third parties facing financial or operational difficulties, including bankruptcies.\n\n## Disruptions in the credit markets or changes to our credit ratings may adversely affect our business.\n\nWhile we currently generate significant cash flows from ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities, a disruption or volatility in the credit markets, interest rate increases or changes to our credit rating could negatively impact the availability or further increase the cost of funding. Reduced access to credit or increased costs could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital. In addition, if any financial institutions that hold our cash or other investments or that are parties to our undrawn revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper programs or other financing arrangements, such as interest rate, foreign exchange or commodity hedging instruments, were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us. This could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate, foreign currency or commodity price exposures. In addition, tighter or more volatile credit markets may lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers, contract manufacturers or trade customers which could, in turn, adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n## Tax matters, including changes in tax rates, disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could negatively impact our business.\n\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S. and in the foreign jurisdictions where we do business. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions have been and may be subject to significant change. Changes in the mix of our earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities related to changes in tax rates, changes in tax  laws, including how ex isting tax  laws are interpreted or enforced, or contemplated changes in long-standing tax  principles, if finalized and adopted, could adversely impact our future effective tax  rate and business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For ex ample, long-standing international tax  norms that determine each country's jurisdiction to tax  cross-border international trade are evolving as a result of a multilateral project, the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project (the 'BEPS Project'), that has established new principles and reporting requirements recommended by the member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the 'OECD'). In connection with the BEPS Project, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities and the public on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in countries outside of the U.S. Many jurisdictions have already enacted legislation and adopted policies resulting from the BEPS Project. The OECD is also addressing the challenges of the digitization of the global economy with plans to redefine jurisdictional taxation rights in market countries and establish a global minimum tax. The European Union has established the Minimum Tax Directive ('Pillar II') that provides for a minimum level of taxation for certain large corporations in every jurisdiction in which they operate. In addition, many other jurisdictions outside of the European Union have also implemented a similar minimum tax regime consistent with the policy of Pillar II. Detailed",

We may not be able to enter into attractive business relationships or ex ecute and complete strategic transactions on favorable terms or at all, and any such relationships or transactions may not improve our competitive position or have the intended financial outcomes. For example, our former investment in JUUL did not result in and, to date, our investment in Cronos has not, resulted in the economic and competitive advantages expected at the time the investments were made.\n\nWe may not be able to realize the expected benefits of the NJOY Transaction in the expected manner or timeframe, if at all, including due to failure to receive or maintain regulatory authorizations, changes in adult tobacco consumer preferences, failure to comply with regulatory requirements, prevailing economic, market, regulatory or business conditions, or changes in such conditions negatively affecting our business and our plans with respect to the e-vapor category, the outcome of any current or future legal proceeding or investigation related to the NJOY Transaction or NJOY or its products and the occurrence of any event requiring us to write down the value of NJOY's goodwill or intangible assets, or both, due to impairment. For example, in January 2025, in a patent lawsuit adjudicated before the ITC, the ITC imposed a ban on the importation of NJOY ACE into the United States and the sale and marketing of NJOY ACE products previously imported into the United States. If the ban on the importation into the United States and the sale and marketing of NJOY ACE becomes effective, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the NJOY  Transaction.\n\nIf the NJOY Transaction or any other acquisition, disposition, joint venture, investment in a third party or other strategic relationship is not successful, there could be a material negative impact on our business, financial position and results of operations and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\n## Significant changes in price, availability or quality of tobacco, other raw materials or component parts could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and business.\n\nShifts in crops (such as those driven by macroeconomic conditions and adverse weather patterns), government restrictions and mandated prices, production control programs, economic trade sanctions, import duties and tariffs, international trade disruptions, labor disruptions, inflation, geopolitical instability, climate and environmental changes and disruptions due to man-made or natural disasters may increase the cost or reduce the supply or quality of tobacco and other raw materials, ingredients and component parts used to manufacture our products. Any significant change in such factors could restrict our ability to continue manufacturing and marketing existing products or impact adult tobacco consumer product acceptability and have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability.\n\nFor varieties of tobacco only available in limited geographies, government-mandated prices and production control programs, political instability or government prohibitions on the import or export of tobacco in certain countries pose additional risks to price, availability and quality. As consumer demand increases for innovative smoke-free products and decreases for combustible and MST products, the volume of tobacco leaf required for production of these products has decreased, resulting in reduced tobacco leaf demand. Reduced demand for tobacco leaf may result in the reduced supply and availability of domestic tobacco and increased costs, as growers divert resources to other crops or cease farming. Macroeconomic factors, such as tariffs, may exacerbate reductions in demand for tobacco leaf by increasing the cost of purchasing tobacco leaf from a supplier in another country. The unavailability or unacceptability of any one or more particular varieties of tobacco leaf or the unavailability of nicotine ex tract necessary to manufacture our operating companies' products could negatively impact our ability to continue marketing existing products or impact adult tobacco consumer product acceptability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability. In addition, the nicotine used in our operating companies' innovative smoke-free products is extracted from tobacco produced in one country. If we are unable to identify alternate sources of nicotine for our operating companies' innovative products, we could be exposed to the risks discussed above.\n\nCurrent geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions (including tariffs, inflation, high interest rates, labor shortages, supply and demand imbalances and international armed conflicts) are causing worldwide disruptions and delays to supply chains and commercial markets, which limit access to, and increase the cost of, raw materials, ingredients and component parts (for example, wood tips used in our cigar products and aluminum used in our packaging). As consumer demand increases for innovative smoke-free products and decreases for combustible and MST products, the volume of raw materials, ingredients and component parts required for the production of these products has decreased. Reduced demand for raw materials, ingredients and component parts may reduce supply and availability and increase the cost of raw materials, ingredients and component parts as suppliers divert resources to other products or cease producing these products. Furthermore, challenging economic conditions can create the risk that our suppliers, distributors, logistics providers or other third-party partners suffer financial or operational difficulties, which may impact their ability to provide us with or distribute finished product, raw materials and component parts and services in a timely manner or at all. If we are unable to identify alternate sources of raw materials, ingredients and component parts for our operating companies' products, we could be exposed to supply risk.\n\nIn addition, government taxes, restrictions and prohibitions on the sale and use of certain products may limit access to, and increase the costs of, raw materials and component parts and, potentially, impede our ability to sell certain of our products. For ex ample, certain states have passed ex tended producer responsibility legislation concerning packaging. Because certain of our products' packaging consists of single-use plastics, single-use plastic bans and extended producer responsibility mandates could result in bans on some of our product packaging or our products and adversely impact our costs and revenues.

          "chunk_text": "## COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Dollars in Millions Ex cept Share and Per Share Amounts)\n\n## Shipping and Handling Costs\n\nShipping and handling costs (also referred to as logistics costs) are classified as Selling, general and administrative ex penses and were $1,777, $1,771 and $1,874 for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Marketing Costs\n\nThe Company markets its products through advertising and other promotional activities. Advertising costs are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses and are expensed as incurred. Certain consumer and trade promotional programs, such as consumer coupons, are recorded as a reduction of sales.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.\n\n## Inventories\n\nThe cost of approximately 75% of inventories is determined using the FIFO method, which is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of the remaining inventories, in the U.S. and Mexico, is determined using the LIFO method, which is stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventories in excess of one year of forecasted sales are classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as noncurrent 'Other assets.'\n\n## Property, Plant and E quipment\n\nLand, buildings and machinery and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided, primarily using the straight-line method, over the estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment and up to 40 years for buildings. Depreciation attributable to manufacturing operations is included in Cost of sales. The remaining component of depreciation is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## Goodwill and Other Intangibles\n\nGoodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets, such as the Company's global brands, are subject to impairment tests at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. In assessing impairment, the Company performs either a quantitative or a qualitative analysis.\n\nDetermining the fair value of the Company's reporting units for goodwill and the fair value of its intangible assets requires significant estimates and judgments by management. When a quantitative analysis is performed, the Company generally uses the income approach, which requires several estimates, including future cash flows consistent with management's strategic plans, sales growth rates and the selection of royalty rates and discount rates. The Company generally engages a third-party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired in business combinations.\n\nAs a result of a reporting structure realignment, the Company reallocated the goodwill of a certain reporting unit from the Europe segment to the North America segment. Before and after the reporting structure realignment, the Company completed an assessment indicating no goodwill impairment was required. Refer to Note 13, Segment Information for additional information.\n\nOther intangible assets with finite lives, such as local brands and trademarks, customer relationships and non-compete agreements, are amortized over their estimated useful lives, generally ranging from 5 to 40 years. Amortization expense related to intangible assets is included in Other (income) expense, net, which is included in Operating profit.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n- Employee Benefit Plans: We provide a range of benefits to certain employees and retired employees, including pension, postretirement health care and postemployment benefits. We record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by GAAP, which include various actuarial assumptions as to discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets, mortality, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates.\n\nWe recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheets and record as a component of other comprehensive earnings (losses), net of deferred income taxes, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost (income). We subsequently amortize the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits recorded as components of other comprehensive earnings (losses) into net periodic benefit cost (income) in future years.\n\n- Fair Value Measurements: We measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as the ex change price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an ex it price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. We use a fair value hierarchy, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are:\n\nLevel 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\n- Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\n\n- Guarantees: We recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation of qualifying guarantee activities. See Note 20 . Contingencies - Guarantees and Other Similar Matters for a further discussion of guarantees.\n- Income Taxes: Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions.\n\nWe determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax  rates in effect for the year in which the differences are ex pected to reverse. We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. We determine the realizability of deferred tax  assets based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence. In reaching this determination, we consider the character of the assets and the possible sources of taxable income of the appropriate character within the available carryback and carryforward periods available under the tax law.\n\nWe recognize the financial statement benefit for uncertain income tax positions in our consolidated financial statements when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon ex amination by tax ing authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For those income tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax  benefit will not be sustained, no tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements. We recognize accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of earnings.\n\n- Inventories: We use the last-in, first-out ('LIFO') method to determine the cost of the majority of our inventories. We determine the cost of the remaining inventories using the first-in, first-out ('FIFO') and average cost methods. We record inventories that are measured using the LIFO method at the lower of cost or market. We state inventories that are measured using the FIFO and average cost methods at the lower of cost and net realizable value. It is a generally recognized industry practice to classify leaf tobacco inventories as a current asset although part of such inventories, because of the duration of the curing and aging process, ordinarily would not be used within one year. We determined the cost of approximately 77% and 76% of our inventories at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, using the LIFO method. The recorded LIFO amounts of our inventories were approximately $0.7 billion lower than the current cost of our inventories at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n- Investments in E quity Securities: Investments in equity securities in which we have the ability to ex ercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting or the fair value option. The election of the fair value option is irrevocable and is made on an investment by investment basis.\n\nWe elected to account for our investments in ABI and Cronos under the equity method of accounting. Our share of equity (income) losses and other adjustments associated with these investments are included in (income) losses from investments in equity securities in our consolidated statements of earnings. We report the carrying value for each of our investments in ABI and Cronos in investments in equity securities on our consolidated balance sheets. We report equity method investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting at cost and adjust these investments each period for our share of (income) losses and dividends paid, if any. We report our share of ABI's and Cronos's results using a one-quarter lag because results are not available in time for us to record them in the concurrent period. At the end of each reporting period, we review our investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our investments to their carrying value.

Given their respective dependencies, how do these companies' supply chain strategies differ in terms of geographic risk exposure when sourcing and distributing goods?",

In contrast, TGT\u2019s reliance on third-party distributors primarily involves direct store deliveries of certain food items and merchandise, but the company does not disclose any specific exposure to Eastern European distributors or geopolitical risks in that region.

      "answer": "Philip Morris International discloses that 4,603,321 shares may be issued upon vesting of restricted share units and 2,854,560 shares may be issued upon vesting of performance share units at maximum performance targets, totaling 7,457,881 shares. Target discloses that, assuming attainment of maximum payout rates, 3.68 million shares of performance-based restricted stock units may be issued. This means PMI's maximum potential share issuance for these equity compensation programs is more than double that of Target's maximum potential issuance of performance-based restricted stock units.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From Philip Morris International's filing, extract the number of shares that may be issued for restricted share units (4,603,321) and performance share units (2,854,560) at maximum performance targets.",
        "Step 2: Calculate the total maximum potential issuance for PMI by summing the two figures: 4,603,321 + 2,854,560 = 7,457,881 shares.",
        "Step 3: From Target's filing, extract the maximum potential issuance of performance-based restricted stock units: 3.68 million shares.",
        "Step 4: Compare the two figures to determine the relative scale of maximum potential issuance between the companies."

      "answer": "PepsiCo identifies the evaluation of unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit matter due to the complexity of applying tax law and interpreting tax authority settlement history, which involves subjective judgment affecting the timing and amount of tax reserves. Procter & Gamble also discloses uncertainty in tax positions, particularly related to intercompany transfer pricing for cross-border transactions, and emphasizes the use of advance rulings to reduce this uncertainty for over 70% of its global earnings. Both companies operate under complex global tax structures involving transfer pricing, and both rely on interpretations of tax law and engagement with tax authorities to manage uncertainty. This shows that the complexity described in PepsiCo\u2019s audit process directly reflects the type of uncertainty P&G seeks to mitigate through advance rulings, highlighting a shared challenge in multinational tax compliance.",

In contrast, while Procter & Gamble also utilizes mass merchandisers as a primary channel, its operational structure spans approximately 180 countries with on-the-ground operations in about 70 countries, indicating a more diversified global presence. Therefore, while both companies depend on mass merchandisers, the strategic importance differs as PepsiCo faces a more concentrated revenue exposure, whereas P&G's broader geographic diversification may reduce dependency risk on any single market or retailer.",
