      "question": "How do the different applications of derivatives for hedging economic exposures at EMR and LMT influence their respective financial risk management strategies, particularly in terms of commodity price fluctuations and foreign currency exchange rate volatility?",
      "answer": "EMR uses derivatives to hedge economic exposures related to commodity-based components in manufacturing and foreign-currency-denominated assets and liabilities, with gains or losses recognized immediately in the income statement. This approach exposes EMR to potential earnings volatility when commodity prices or exchange rates fluctuate. In contrast, LMT designates most of its foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges, which reduces earnings volatility by deferring gains or losses to accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged transaction affects earnings. Additionally, LMT\u2019s use of interest rate swaps to convert fixed-rate borrowings to variable or vice versa further stabilizes its interest expense. Therefore, LMT\u2019s broader use of hedge accounting provides more earnings stability compared to EMR, which absorbs more immediate financial impact from market movements.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From EMR\u2019s filing, we learn that derivatives not designated as hedges (e.g., those hedging commodity purchases and foreign-currency-denominated assets/liabilities) are recognized immediately in earnings, leading to potential volatility.",
        "Step 2: From LMT\u2019s filing, we see that foreign currency hedges are predominantly designated as cash flow hedges, which defer gains/losses until the hedged transaction affects earnings, thereby reducing earnings volatility.",
        "Step 3: LMT also uses interest rate swaps to manage exposure from fixed and variable rate borrowings, converting between the two to stabilize interest costs, a strategy not mentioned for EMR.",
        "Step 4: Synthesizing both, we conclude that LMT\u2019s hedging strategy, with greater use of hedge accounting, provides more earnings stability, while EMR\u2019s approach results in more immediate financial exposure to market fluctuations."

          "chunk_text": "that are designated as hedges and qualify for hedge accounting are cash flow hedges. For derivatives hedging the fair value of existing assets or liabilities, both the gain or loss on the derivative and the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item are recognized in earnings each period. Currency fluctuations on non-U.S. dollar obligations that have been designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to income in the same period when a foreign operation is sold or substantially liquidated and the gain or loss related to the sale is included in income. To the extent that any hedge is not fully effective at offsetting changes in the underlying hedged item, there could be a net earnings impact.\n\nThe Company also uses derivatives to hedge economic exposures that do not receive hedge accounting under ASC 815. The underlying exposures for these hedges relate primarily to purchases of commodity-based components used in the Company's manufacturing processes, and the revaluation of certain foreign-currency-denominated assets and liabilities. In addition, in fiscal 2022 AspenTech entered into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange associated with the Micromine purchase price. Gains or losses on derivative instruments not designated as hedges are recognized in the income statement immediately.\n\nCounterparties to derivative arrangements are companies with investment-grade credit ratings. The Company has bilateral collateral arrangements with counterparties with credit rating-based posting thresholds that vary depending on the arrangement. If credit ratings on the Company's debt fall below pre-established levels, counterparties can require immediate full collateralization on all derivatives in net liability positions. The maximum amount that could potentially have been required was immaterial. The Company also can demand full collateralization of derivatives in net asset positions should any counterparty credit ratings fall below certain thresholds. No collateral was posted with counterparties and none was held by the Company at year end. Risk from credit loss when derivatives are in asset positions is not considered material. The Company has master netting arrangements in place with its counterparties that allow the offsetting of certain derivative-related amounts receivable and payable when settlement occurs in the same period. Accordingly, counterparty balances are netted in the consolidated balance sheet and are reported in other current assets or accrued expenses as appropriate, depending on positions with counterparties as of the balance sheet date. See Note 9.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nThe provision for income taxes is based on pretax income reported in the consolidated statements of earnings and tax rates currently enacted in each jurisdiction. Certain income and expense items are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting and income tax filing purposes, and deferred income taxes are provided for the effect of temporary differences. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act subjects the Company to U.S. tax on global intangible low-taxed income earned by certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company has elected to recognize this tax as a period expense when it is incurred. The Company also provides for withholding taxes and any applicable U.S. income taxes on earnings intended to be repatriated from non-U.S. locations. No provision has been made for these taxes on approximately $6.0 billion of undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as of September 30, 2022, as these earnings are considered indefinitely invested or otherwise retained for continuing international operations. Recognition of withholding taxes and any applicable U.S. income taxes on undistributed non-U.S. earnings would be triggered by a management decision to repatriate those earnings. Determination of the amount of taxes that might be paid on these undistributed earnings if eventually remitted is not practicable. See Note 14.",

The fair values of mutual funds and certain other securities are determined by reference to the quoted market price per unit in  active  markets  multiplied  by  the  number  of  units  held  without  consideration  of  transaction  costs.  The  fair  values  of  U.S. Government and certain other securities are determined using pricing models that use observable inputs (e.g., interest rates and yield  curves  observable  at  commonly  quoted  intervals),  bids  provided  by  brokers  or  dealers  or  quoted  prices  of  securities  with similar characteristics. The fair values of derivative instruments, which consist of foreign currency forward contracts, including embedded derivatives, and interest rate swap contracts, are primarily determined based on the present value of future cash flows using model-derived valuations that use observable inputs such as interest rates, credit spreads and foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nWe use derivative instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We do not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. We transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the British pound sterling, the euro, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Norwegian Kroner and the Polish Zloty. These contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges.  We  also  are  exposed  to  the  impact  of  interest  rate  changes  primarily  through  our  borrowing  activities.  For  fixed  rate borrowings, we may use variable interest rate swaps, effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings in order to hedge changes in the fair value of the debt. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges. For variable rate borrowings, we may use fixed interest rate swaps, effectively converting variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on earnings. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. We also may enter into derivative instruments  that  are  not  designated  as  hedges  and  do  not  qualify  for  hedge  accounting,  which  are  intended  to  mitigate  certain economic exposures.\n\nThe aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $500 million and $572 million. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedges at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $4.0 billion and $3.4 billion. The fair values of our outstanding interest rate swaps and foreign currency hedges at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were not significant. Derivative instruments did not have a material impact on net earnings and comprehensive income during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The impact of derivative instruments on our consolidated statements of cash flows  is  included  in  net  cash  provided  by  operating  activities.  Substantially  all  of  our  derivatives  are  designated  for  hedge accounting. See 'Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies - Derivative financial instruments'.\n\nIn addition to the financial instruments listed in the table above, we hold other financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and debt. The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable approximated their fair values. The estimated fair value of our outstanding debt was $15.4 billion and $16.9 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The outstanding principal amount was $12.8 billion and $13.3 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, excluding $1.1 billion of unamortized discounts and issuance costs at both December 31, 2021 and 2020.

      "answer": "For EMR, the percentage-of-completion method is used for approximately 10% of revenues, primarily in the Systems & Software product offering within the Automation Solutions segment. This method measures progress based on costs incurred, which EMR believes closely corresponds with the transfer of control to the customer. For LMT, the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method is central to measuring progress on long-term contracts, where profit booking rates are adjusted based on changes in estimated total costs to complete contracts. When LMT retires risks related to technical, schedule, or cost aspects of a contract, profit booking rates increase, impacting segment operating profit and margin. Conversely, if costs increase or variable consideration decreases, profit booking rates decrease. Therefore, both EMR and LMT rely on cost-based progress measurement, but LMT explicitly ties profit booking rate adjustments to risk retirement or escalation, directly influencing financial reporting outcomes.",

          "chunk_text": "contracts include multiple performance obligations, where revenue is recognized separately for each good or service, as well as contracts where revenue is recognized over time as control transfers to the customer.\n\nRevenue is recognized over time for approximately 10 percent of the Company's revenues. The majority of these revenues relate to projects in the Systems &amp; Software product offering within the Automation Solutions segment where revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method to reflect the transfer of control over time, while a smaller amount is attributable to long-term maintenance and service contracts where revenue is typically recognized on a straight-line basis as the services are provided. Approximately 5 percent of revenues relate to sales arrangements with multiple performance obligations, principally in the Automation Solutions and AspenTech segments. Tangible products represent a large majority of the delivered items in contracts with multiple performance obligations or where revenue is recognized over time, while a smaller portion is attributable to installation, service and maintenance.\n\nFor projects where revenue is recognized over time, the Company typically uses an input method to determine progress and recognize revenue, based on costs incurred. The Company believes costs incurred closely correspond with its performance under the contract and the transfer of control to the customer.\n\nIn sales arrangements that involve multiple performance obligations, revenue is allocated based on the relative standalone selling price for each performance obligation. Observable selling prices from actual transactions are used whenever possible. In other instances, the Company determines the standalone selling price based on third-party pricing or management's best estimate. Generally, contract duration is short-term, and cancellation, termination or refund provisions apply only in the event of contract breach and are rarely invoked.\n\nPayment terms vary but are generally short-term in nature. The Company's long-term contracts, where revenue is generally recognized over time, are typically billed as work progresses in accordance with the contract terms and conditions, either at periodic intervals or upon achievement of certain milestones. The timing of revenue recognition and billings under these contracts results in either unbilled receivables (contract assets) when revenue recognized exceeds billings, or customer advances (contract liabilities) when billings exceed revenue recognized. Unbilled receivables are reclassified to accounts receivable when an unconditional right to consideration exists, typically when a milestone in the contract is achieved. The Company does not evaluate whether the transaction price includes a significant financing component for contracts where the time between cash collection and performance is less than one year.\n\nCertain arrangements with customers include variable consideration, typically in the form of rebates, cash discounts or penalties. In limited circumstances, the Company sells products with a general right of return. In most instances, returns are limited to product quality issues. The Company records a reduction to revenue at the time of sale to reflect the ultimate amount of consideration it expects to receive. The Company's estimates are updated quarterly based on historical experience, trend analysis, and expected market conditions. Variable consideration is typically not constrained at the time revenue is recognized. See Notes 2 and 18 for additional information about the Company's revenues.\n\n## Derivatives and Hedging\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices due to its worldwide presence and diverse business profile. The Company's foreign currency exposures relate to transactions denominated in currencies that differ from the functional currencies of its business units, primarily in euros, Mexican pesos, and Singapore dollars. Primary commodity exposures are price fluctuations on forecasted purchases of copper and aluminum and related products. As part of the Company's risk management strategy, derivative instruments are selectively used in an effort to minimize the impact of these exposures. Foreign exchange forwards and options are utilized to hedge foreign currency exposures impacting sales or cost of sales transactions, firm commitments and the fair value of assets and liabilities, while swap and option contracts may be used to minimize the effect of commodity price fluctuations on the cost of sales. Non-U.S. dollar obligations are utilized to reduce foreign currency risk associated with the Company's net investments in foreign operations. All derivatives are associated with specific underlying exposures and the Company does not hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. The duration of hedge positions is generally two years or less, except for the Company's net investment hedges.\n\nAll derivatives are accounted for under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , and recognized at fair value. For derivatives hedging variability in future cash flows, any gain or loss is deferred in stockholders' equity and recognized when the underlying hedged transaction impacts earnings.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nFor performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the performance obligation(s). For performance obligations to provide services to the customer, revenue is recognized over time based on costs incurred or the right to invoice method (in situations where the value transferred matches our billing rights) as our customer receives and consumes the benefits.\n\nFor performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied. This coincides with the point in time the customer obtains control of the product or service, which typically occurs upon customer acceptance or receipt of the product or service, given that we maintain control of the product or service until that point.\n\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales and costs, including the profit booking rate. At the outset of a long-term contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the  contract,  as  well  as  variable  consideration,  and  assess  the  effects  of  those  risks  on  our  estimates  of  sales  and  total  costs  to complete  the  contract.  The  estimates  consider  the  technical  requirements  (e.g.,  a  newly-developed  product  versus  a  mature product),  the  schedule  and  associated  tasks  (e.g.,  the  number  and  type  of  milestone  events)  and  costs  (e.g.,  material,  labor, subcontractor,  overhead,  general  and  administrative  and  the  estimated  costs  to  fulfill  our  industrial  cooperation  agreements, sometimes  referred  to  as  offset  or  localization  agreements,  required  under  certain  contracts  with  international  customers).  The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated  total  costs  to  complete  the  contract  or  may  increase  the  variable  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  on  the  contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase or our estimates of variable  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  decrease. All  of  the  estimates  are  subject  to  change  during  the  performance  of  the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of the transaction price, a provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.\n\nComparability of our segment sales, operating  profit  and  operating  margin  may  be  impacted  favorably  or  unfavorably  by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost  method  to  measure  progress  towards  completion.  Increases  in  the  profit  booking  rates,  typically  referred  to  as  risk retirements,  usually  relate  to  revisions  in  the  estimated  total  costs  to  fulfill  the  performance  obligations  that  reflect  improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the period they are determined and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring  charges,  except  for  significant  severance  actions,  which  are  excluded  from  segment  operating  results;  reserves  for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.\n\n## Other Contract Accounting Considerations\n\nThe majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. Government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the FAR. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are  allowable  in  establishing  prices  for  goods  and  services  under  U.S.  Government  contracts.  For  example,  costs  such  as  those related  to  charitable  contributions,  interest  expense  and  certain  advertising  and  public  relations  activities  are  unallowable  and, therefore, not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into advance agreements with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For example, most of the environmental costs we incur for environmental remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under FAR provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the U.S. Government.\n\nWe  closely  monitor  compliance  with  and  the  consistent  application  of  our  critical  accounting  policies  related  to  contract accounting.  Costs  incurred  and  allocated  to  contracts  are  reviewed  for  compliance  with  U.S.  Government  regulations  by  our personnel and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.",

Lockheed Martin similarly includes options to terminate leases in the right-of-use (ROU) asset and liability when it is 'reasonably certain' they will be exercised, but it specifically notes that it applies a portfolio approach to recognize ROU assets and liabilities for certain equipment leases. Both companies use the 'reasonably certain' threshold, but Lockheed Martin\u2019s additional use of a portfolio approach for equipment leases introduces a methodological difference in how termination options may affect lease accounting for certain asset categories.",

          "chunk_text": "business. A reporting unit is an operating segment as defined in ASC 280, Segment Reporting , or a business one level below an operating segment if discrete financial information for that business unit is prepared and regularly reviewed by the segment manager. The Company conducts annual impairment tests of goodwill in the fourth quarter. If an initial assessment indicates it is more likely than not goodwill might be impaired, it is evaluated by comparing the reporting unit's estimated fair value to its carrying value. An impairment charge would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value. Goodwill is also tested for impairment between annual tests if events or circumstances indicate the fair value of a unit may be less than its carrying value. Estimated fair values of reporting units are Level 3 measures and are developed generally under an income approach that discounts estimated future cash flows using risk-adjusted interest rates, as well as earnings multiples or other techniques as warranted. Fair values are subject to changes in underlying economic conditions.\n\nAll of the Company's identifiable intangible assets are subject to amortization on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Identifiable intangibles consist of intellectual property such as technology, patents and trademarks, customer relationships and capitalized software. Identifiable intangibles are also subject to evaluation for potential impairment if events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. See Note 8.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe Company leases offices; manufacturing facilities and equipment; and transportation, information technology and office equipment under operating lease arrangements. Finance lease arrangements are immaterial. The Company determines whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at contract inception. An arrangement contains a lease if the Company has the right to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of an identified asset. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at lease commencement based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet and are recorded as short-term lease expense. The discount rate used to calculate present value is the Company's incremental borrowing rate based on the lease term and the economic environment of the applicable country or region.\n\nCertain leases contain renewal options or options to terminate prior to lease expiration, which are included in the measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities when it is reasonably certain they will be exercised. The Company has elected to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for its offices and manufacturing facilities. Some lease arrangements include payments that are adjusted periodically based on actual charges incurred for common area maintenance, utilities, taxes and insurance, or changes in an index or rate referenced in the lease. The fixed portion of these payments is included in the measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at lease commencement, while the variable portion is recorded as variable lease expense. The Company's leases typically do not contain material residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.\n\n## Product Warranty\n\nWarranties vary by product line and are competitive for the markets in which the Company operates. Warranties are largely offered to provide assurance that the product will function as intended and generally extend for a period of one to two years from the date of sale or installation. Provisions for warranty expense are estimated at the time of sale based on historical experience and adjusted quarterly for any known issues that may arise. Product warranty expense is less than one-half of one percent of sales.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nEmerson is a global manufacturer that designs and manufactures products and delivers services that bring technology and engineering together to provide innovative solutions for its customers, largely in the form of tangible products. The Company evaluates its contracts with customers to identify the promised goods or services and recognizes revenue for the identified performance obligations at the amount the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. Revenue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied and control has transferred to the customer, typically when products are shipped or delivered, title and risk of loss pass to the customer, and the Company has a present right to payment. The majority of the Company's revenues relate to a broad offering of manufactured products which are recognized at the point in time when control transfers, generally in accordance with shipping terms. A portion of the Company's revenues relate to the sale of software and post-contract customer support, parts and labor for repairs, and engineering services. In some circumstances,",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nworking capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. The discount rates utilized in the DCF analysis are based on the respective reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. The carrying value of each reporting unit includes the assets and liabilities employed in its operations, goodwill and allocations of certain assets and liabilities held at the business segment and corporate levels.\n\nDuring  the  fourth  quarters  of  2021,  2020  and  2019,  we  performed  our  annual  goodwill  impairment  test  for  each  of  our reporting units. The results of our annual impairment tests of goodwill indicated that no impairment existed.\n\nAcquired intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment testing. This testing  compares carrying value to fair value and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. Finite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over the applicable useful lives, ranging from five to 20 years, based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic benefit as reflected by future net cash inflows. We perform an impairment test of finite-lived intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may be impaired.\n\nLeases - We evaluate whether our contractual arrangements contain leases at the inception of such arrangements. Specifically, we consider whether we can control the underlying asset and have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits or outputs from the asset. Substantially all of our leases are long-term operating leases with fixed payment terms. We do not have significant financing leases. Our right-of-use (ROU) operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease  term,  and  our  operating  lease  liabilities  represent  our  obligation  to  make  lease  payments.  ROU  operating  lease  assets  are recorded  in  other  noncurrent  assets  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheet.  Operating  lease  liabilities  are  recorded  in  other  current liabilities or other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet based on their contractual due dates.\n\nBoth the ROU operating lease asset and liability are recognized as of the lease commencement date at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. Most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate that can readily be determined. Therefore, we use a discount rate based on our incremental borrowing rate, which is determined using our credit rating and information available as of the commencement date. ROU operating lease assets include lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, net of any lease incentives.\n\nOur operating lease agreements may include options to extend the lease term or terminate it early. We include options to extend or  terminate  leases  in  the  ROU  operating  lease  asset  and  liability  when  it  is  reasonably  certain  we  will  exercise  these  options. Operating  lease  expense  is  recognized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  lease  term  and  is  included  in  cost  of  sales  on  our consolidated statement of earnings.\n\nWe have operating lease arrangements with lease and non-lease components. The non-lease components in our arrangements are  not  significant  when  compared  to  the  lease  components.  For  all  operating  leases,  we  account  for  the  lease  and  non-lease components as a single component. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to recognize operating lease ROU assets and liabilities. We evaluate ROU assets for impairment consistent with our property, plant and equipment policy.\n\nPostretirement  benefit  plans -  Many  of  our  employees  and  retirees  participate  in  defined  benefit  pension  plans,  retiree medical and life insurance plans, and other postemployment plans (collectively, postretirement benefit plans). GAAP requires that the amounts we record related to our postretirement benefit plans be computed, based on service to date, using actuarial valuations that are based in part on certain key economic assumptions we make, including the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity (also known as mortality), health care cost trend rates and employee turnover, each as appropriate based on the nature of the plans.\n\nA market-related value of our plan assets, determined using actual asset gains or losses over the prior three year period, is used to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. These asset gains or losses, along with those resulting from adjustments to our benefit obligation, will be amortized to expense using the corridor method, where gains and losses are recognized over a period of years to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater of plan assets or benefit obligations.\n\nWe recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans as either an asset recorded within other noncurrent assets or a liability recorded within noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The GAAP funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan's assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. The funded status under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended, is calculated on a different basis than under GAAP.",

          "chunk_text": "contracts include multiple performance obligations, where revenue is recognized separately for each good or service, as well as contracts where revenue is recognized over time as control transfers to the customer.\n\nRevenue is recognized over time for approximately 10 percent of the Company's revenues. The majority of these revenues relate to projects in the Systems &amp; Software product offering within the Automation Solutions segment where revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method to reflect the transfer of control over time, while a smaller amount is attributable to long-term maintenance and service contracts where revenue is typically recognized on a straight-line basis as the services are provided. Approximately 5 percent of revenues relate to sales arrangements with multiple performance obligations, principally in the Automation Solutions and AspenTech segments. Tangible products represent a large majority of the delivered items in contracts with multiple performance obligations or where revenue is recognized over time, while a smaller portion is attributable to installation, service and maintenance.\n\nFor projects where revenue is recognized over time, the Company typically uses an input method to determine progress and recognize revenue, based on costs incurred. The Company believes costs incurred closely correspond with its performance under the contract and the transfer of control to the customer.\n\nIn sales arrangements that involve multiple performance obligations, revenue is allocated based on the relative standalone selling price for each performance obligation. Observable selling prices from actual transactions are used whenever possible. In other instances, the Company determines the standalone selling price based on third-party pricing or management's best estimate. Generally, contract duration is short-term, and cancellation, termination or refund provisions apply only in the event of contract breach and are rarely invoked.\n\nPayment terms vary but are generally short-term in nature. The Company's long-term contracts, where revenue is generally recognized over time, are typically billed as work progresses in accordance with the contract terms and conditions, either at periodic intervals or upon achievement of certain milestones. The timing of revenue recognition and billings under these contracts results in either unbilled receivables (contract assets) when revenue recognized exceeds billings, or customer advances (contract liabilities) when billings exceed revenue recognized. Unbilled receivables are reclassified to accounts receivable when an unconditional right to consideration exists, typically when a milestone in the contract is achieved. The Company does not evaluate whether the transaction price includes a significant financing component for contracts where the time between cash collection and performance is less than one year.\n\nCertain arrangements with customers include variable consideration, typically in the form of rebates, cash discounts or penalties. In limited circumstances, the Company sells products with a general right of return. In most instances, returns are limited to product quality issues. The Company records a reduction to revenue at the time of sale to reflect the ultimate amount of consideration it expects to receive. The Company's estimates are updated quarterly based on historical experience, trend analysis, and expected market conditions. Variable consideration is typically not constrained at the time revenue is recognized. See Notes 2 and 18 for additional information about the Company's revenues.\n\n## Derivatives and Hedging\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices due to its worldwide presence and diverse business profile. The Company's foreign currency exposures relate to transactions denominated in currencies that differ from the functional currencies of its business units, primarily in euros, Mexican pesos, and Singapore dollars. Primary commodity exposures are price fluctuations on forecasted purchases of copper and aluminum and related products. As part of the Company's risk management strategy, derivative instruments are selectively used in an effort to minimize the impact of these exposures. Foreign exchange forwards and options are utilized to hedge foreign currency exposures impacting sales or cost of sales transactions, firm commitments and the fair value of assets and liabilities, while swap and option contracts may be used to minimize the effect of commodity price fluctuations on the cost of sales. Non-U.S. dollar obligations are utilized to reduce foreign currency risk associated with the Company's net investments in foreign operations. All derivatives are associated with specific underlying exposures and the Company does not hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. The duration of hedge positions is generally two years or less, except for the Company's net investment hedges.\n\nAll derivatives are accounted for under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , and recognized at fair value. For derivatives hedging variability in future cash flows, any gain or loss is deferred in stockholders' equity and recognized when the underlying hedged transaction impacts earnings. The majority of the Company's derivatives",

Cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts provide a fixed fee that is negotiated at the inception of the contract and does not vary with actual costs.\n\nWe assess each contract at its inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contracts. When making this determination, we consider factors such as whether two or more contracts were negotiated and executed at or near the same time or were negotiated with an overall profit objective. If  combined, we treat the combined contracts as a single contract for revenue recognition purposes.\n\nWe evaluate  the  products  or  services  promised  in  each  contract  at  inception  to  determine  whether  the  contract  should  be accounted for as having one or more performance obligations. The products and services in our contracts are typically not distinct from one another due to their complex relationships and the significant contract management functions required to perform under the contract. Accordingly, our contracts are typically accounted for as one performance obligation. In limited cases, our contracts have  more  than  one  distinct  performance  obligation,  which  occurs  when  we  perform  activities  that  are  not  highly  complex  or interrelated or involve different product lifecycles. Significant judgment is required in determining performance obligations, and these decisions could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period. We classify net sales as products or services on our consolidated statements of earnings based on the predominant attributes of the performance obligations.\n\nWe determine the transaction  price  for  each  contract  based  on  the  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  for  the  products  or services being provided under the contract. For contracts where a portion of the price may vary, we estimate variable consideration at  the  most  likely  amount,  which  is  included  in  the  transaction  price  to  the  extent  it  is  probable  that  a  significant  reversal  of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. We analyze the risk of a significant revenue reversal and if necessary constrain the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk.\n\nAt the inception of a contract we estimate the transaction price based on our current rights and do not contemplate future modifications (including unexercised options) or follow-on contracts until they become legally enforceable. Contracts are often subsequently  modified  to  include  changes  in  specifications,  requirements  or  price,  which  may  create  new  or  change  existing enforceable  rights  and  obligations.  Depending  on  the  nature  of  the  modification,  we  consider  whether  to  account  for  the modification as an adjustment to the existing contract or as a separate contract. Generally, modifications to our contracts are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration and interrelated tasks provided in the context of the contract. Therefore,  such  modifications  are  accounted  for  as  if  they  were  part  of  the  existing  contract  and  recognized  as  a  cumulative adjustment to revenue.\n\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated standalone selling price of the product or service underlying each performance obligation. The standalone selling price represents the amount we would sell the product or service to a customer on a standalone basis (i.e., not bundled with any other  products  or  services).  Our  contracts  with  the  U.S.  Government,  including  FMS  contracts,  are  subject  to  the  Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and the price is typically based on estimated or actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. As a result of these regulations, the standalone selling price of products or services in our contracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts are typically equal to the selling price stated in the contract.\n\nFor non-U.S. Government contracts with multiple performance obligations, we evaluate whether the stated selling prices for the products or services represent their standalone selling prices. We primarily sell customized solutions unique to a customer's specifications.  When  it  is  necessary  to  allocate  the  transaction  price  to  multiple  performance  obligations,  we  typically  use  the expected cost plus a reasonable profit margin to estimate the standalone selling price of each product or service. We occasionally sell standard products or services with observable standalone sales transactions. In these situations, the observable standalone sales transactions are used to determine the standalone selling price.\n\nWe recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. In determining when performance obligations are satisfied, we consider factors such as contract terms, payment terms and whether there is an alternative future use of the product or service. Substantially all of our revenue is recognized over time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfers continuously to the customer. For most contracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts, this continuous transfer of control of the work in process to the customer is supported by clauses in the contract that give the customer ownership of work in process and allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience  and  pay  us  for  costs  incurred  plus  a  reasonable  profit.  For  most  non-U.S.  Government  contracts,  primarily international direct commercial contracts, continuous transfer of control to our customer is supported because we deliver products that  do  not  have  an  alternative  use  to  us  and  if  our  customer  were  to  terminate  the  contract  for  reasons  other  than  our  nonperformance  we  would  have  the  right  to  recover  damages  which  would  include,  among  other  potential  damages,  the  right  to payment for our work performed to date plus a reasonable profit.",

In contrast, Union Pacific explicitly structures its Section 16(a) compliance disclosure within its 10-K under a dedicated section titled 'Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance' and also incorporates it by reference from its Proxy Statement. This shows that while both companies comply with Section 16(a) disclosure requirements, they differ in the presentation and labeling of this regulatory requirement within their filings.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, Lockheed Martin states that information required by Item 405 of Regulation S-K (which governs Section 16(a) reporting) is included under 'Delinquent Section 16(a) Reports' in the 2022 Proxy Statement and is incorporated by reference in the 10-K, but it is not presented directly in the provided chunk.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, Union Pacific explicitly references Section 16(a) compliance under a clearly labeled segment titled 'Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance' in its Proxy Statement, which is then incorporated by reference into the 10-K filing.",
        "Step 3: Comparing both, the key distinction lies in the labeling and structure of Section 16(a) compliance within the 10-K document, even though both companies rely on incorporation by reference from their Proxy Statements."

      "answer": "ASU 2021-10 requires both Lockheed Martin and Union Pacific to enhance their financial statement disclosures regarding government assistance. Specifically, the standard mandates entities to disclose the nature of the assistance, the related accounting policies used, the effect of the assistance on the financial statements, and any significant terms and conditions of the agreements, including commitments and contingencies. For Lockheed Martin, the adoption of ASU 2021-10 became effective on January 1, 2022, and it only impacts annual financial statement footnote disclosures without having a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Similarly, Union Pacific is currently evaluating the effect of the new guidance on its disclosures, as the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nReference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting\n\nIn  2017,  the  United  Kingdom's  Financial  Conduct Authority  (FCA)  announced  that  after  2021  it  would  no  longer  compel banks  to  submit  the  rates  required  to  calculate  the  London  Interbank  Offered  Rate  (LIBOR),  which  have  been  widely  used  as reference rates for various securities and financial contracts, including loans, debt and derivatives. This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis is not guaranteed after 2021. Subsequently in March 2021, the FCA announced some USD LIBOR tenors (overnight, 1 month, 3 month, 6 month and 12 month) will continue to be published until June 30, 2023. Regulators in the U.S. and other jurisdictions have been working to replace these rates with alternative reference interest rates that are supported by transactions in liquid and observable markets, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) for USD LIBOR. Currently, our credit facility and certain of our derivative instruments reference LIBOR-based rates. Our credit facility contains  provisions  specifying  alternative  interest  rate  calculations  to  be  employed  when  LIBOR  ceases  to  be  available  as  a benchmark and we have adhered to the ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol, which will govern our derivatives upon the final cessation of USD LIBOR. ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on  Financial  Reporting ,  as  amended,  helps  limit  the  accounting  impact  from  contract  modifications,  including  hedging relationships, due to the transition from LIBOR to alternative reference rates that are completed by December 31, 2022. We do not expect a significant impact to our operating results, financial position or cash flows from the transition from LIBOR to alternative reference interest rates, but we will continue to monitor the impact of this transition until it is completed.\n\nBusiness Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers\n\nIn  October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers , which requires entities to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities  acquired in a business combination in accordance with ASC 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) .  The update will generally result in an entity recognizing contract assets and contract liabilities at amounts consistent with those recorded by the acquiree immediately before the acquisition date rather than at fair value. The new standard is effective on a prospective basis for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. We adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2022. The adoption of the new standard did not have an impact to our operating results, financial position, or cash flows.\n\n## Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities About Government Assistance\n\nIn  November  2021,  the  FASB  issued ASU  2021-10, Government Assistance  (Topic  832) , Disclosures  by  Business  Entities About Government Assistance, which requires entities to provide disclosures on material government assistance transactions for annual reporting periods. The disclosures include information around the nature of the assistance, the related accounting policies used  to  account  for  government  assistance,  the  effect  of  government  assistance  on  the  entity's  financial  statements,  and  any significant terms and conditions of the agreements, including commitments and contingencies. The new standard is effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2022 and only impacts annual financial statement footnote disclosures. Therefore, the adoption will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Note 2 - Pending Acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc.\n\nOn December 20, 2020, we entered into an agreement to acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. (Aerojet Rocketdyne) for $51.00 per share, which is net of a $5.00 per share special cash dividend Aerojet Rocketdyne paid to its stockholders on March 24, 2021. At the time of announcement, this represented a post-dividend equity value of approximately $4.6 billion, on a fully diluted as-converted  basis,  and  a  transaction  value  of  approximately  $4.4  billion  after  the  assumption  of  Aerojet  Rocketdyne's  thenprojected net cash. If the transaction is completed, we expect to finance the acquisition primarily through new debt issuances. The transaction was approved by Aerojet Rocketdyne's stockholders on March 9, 2021. As part of the regulatory review process of the transaction,  on  September  24,  2021,  we  and Aerojet  Rocketdyne  each  certified  substantial  compliance  with  the  Federal  Trade Commission's (FTC) requests for additional information, known as a 'second request.' On January 11, 2022, the parties provided an updated notice of their intended closing date under their timing agreement with the FTC, whereby the parties agreed that they would not close the transaction before January 27, 2022, to enable the parties to discuss the scope and nature of the merchant supply and firewall commitments previously offered to the FTC by Lockheed Martin. We have been advised by the FTC that its concerns regarding the transaction cannot be addressed adequately by the terms of a consent order. We believe it is highly likely that the FTC will vote to sue to block the transaction and expect they will make a decision before January 27, 2022. If the FTC sues to block the transaction, we could elect to defend the lawsuit within 30 days or terminate the merger agreement. If the FTC does not file a lawsuit to block the transaction before January 27, 2022, the parties could proceed to close the transaction, but there is no assurance that the FTC would not file a lawsuit",

The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after  December 15, 2021. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the new guidance will have on our related disclosures.\n\n## 4.

      "question": "How do the environmental remediation obligations of Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Union Pacific (UNP) differ in terms of financial exposure and operational impact, based on their respective disclosures in their 2022 10-K filings?",
      "answer": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) states that while the extent of its financial exposure for environmental remediation cannot always be reasonably estimated, the costs are not expected to have a material adverse effect on its earnings, financial position, or cash flow, primarily because these costs are generally allowable in pricing its government contracts. In contrast, Union Pacific (UNP) acknowledges that it could incur significant costs for environmental remediation obligations, and such costs could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. This indicates that while LMT has a contractual mechanism to offset these costs, UNP lacks such protections and faces a higher financial and operational risk from its environmental liabilities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - LMT states that environmental compliance costs are not expected to have a material adverse effect on earnings, financial position, or cash flow because these costs are generally allowable under U.S. Government contracts.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - UNP states that it could incur significant environmental remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The difference in financial exposure and operational impact lies in the contractual allowance of costs for LMT versus the lack of such allowance for UNP, leading to differing levels of risk despite both being subject to environmental remediation obligations."

As a result of these environmental protection laws, we are involved in environmental remediation at some of our current and former facilities  and  at  third-party-owned  sites  where  we  have  been  designated  a  potentially  responsible  party  as  a  result  of  our  prior activities  and  those  of  our  predecessor  companies. While the extent of our financial exposure cannot in all cases be reasonably estimated, the costs of environmental compliance have not had, and we do not expect that these costs will have, a material adverse effect on our earnings, financial position and cash flow, primarily because substantially all of our environmental costs are allowable in  establishing the price of our products and services under our contracts with the U.S. Government. For information regarding these matters, including current estimates of the amounts that we believe are required for remediation or cleanup to the extent that they  are  probable  and  estimable,  see  'Critical Accounting  Policies  -  Environmental  Matters'  in  Management's  Discussion  and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and 'Note 15 - Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

We  generate  and  transport  hazardous  and  nonhazardous waste in our operations. Environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties, leased properties, properties owned by third-parties, as well as properties we currently own. Environmental liabilities have  arisen  and  may  also  arise  from  claims  asserted  by  adjacent  landowners  or  other  third-parties  in  toxic  tort litigation. We have been and may be subject to allegations or findings that we have violated, or are strictly liable under,  these  laws  or  regulations.  We  currently  have  certain  obligations  at  existing  sites  for  investigation, remediation,  and  monitoring,  and  we  likely  will  have  obligations  at  other  sites  in  the  future.  Liabilities  for  these obligations  affect  our  estimate  based  on  our  experience  and,  as  necessary,  the  advice  and  assistance  of  our consultants.  However,  actual  costs  may  vary  from  our  estimates  due  to  any  or  all  of  several  factors,  including changes to environmental laws or interpretations of such laws, technological changes affecting investigations and remediation,  the  participation  and  financial  viability  of  other  parties  responsible  for  any  such  liability,  and  the corrective action or change to corrective actions required to remediate any existing or future sites. We could incur significant  costs  as  a  result  of  any  of  the  foregoing,  and  we  may  be  required  to  incur  significant  expenses  to investigate  and  remediate  known,  unknown,  or  future  environmental  contamination,  which  could  have  a  material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\n\n## Macroeconomic and Industry Risks\n\nWe Face Competition from Other Railroads and Other Transportation Providers - We face competition from other railroads, motor carriers, ships, barges, and pipelines. Our main railroad competitor is Burlington Northern Santa Fe LLC. Its primary subsidiary, BNSF Railway Company (BNSF), operates parallel routes in many of our main traffic corridors. In addition, we operate in corridors served by other railroads and motor carriers. Motor carrier competition exists for all three of our commodity groups (excluding most coal shipments). Because of the proximity of our routes to  major  inland  and  Gulf  Coast  waterways,  barges  can  be  particularly  competitive,  especially  for  grain  and  bulk commodities in certain areas where we operate. In addition to price competition, we face competition with respect to transit times, quality, and reliability of service from motor carriers and other railroads. Motor carriers in particular can have an advantage over railroads with respect to transit times and timeliness of service. However, railroads are much more fuel-efficient than trucks, which reduces the impact of transporting goods on the environment and public infrastructure, and we have been making efforts to convert truck traffic to rail. Additionally, we must build or acquire and  maintain  our  rail  system,  while  trucks,  barges,  and  maritime  operators  are  able  to  use  public  rights-of-way maintained  by  public  entities.  Any  of  the  following  could  also  affect  the  competitiveness  of  our  transportation services for some or all of our commodities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity: (i) improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the costs of these alternative modes of transportation, such as autonomous or more fuel efficient trucks, (ii) legislation that eliminates or significantly increases the size or weight limitations applied to motor carriers, or (iii) legislation or regulatory changes that impose operating restrictions on railroads or that adversely affect the profitability of some or all railroad traffic. Many movements face product or geographic competition where our customers can use different products (e.g., natural gas instead of coal, sorghum instead of corn) or commodities from different locations (e.g., grain from states or countries that we do not serve, crude oil from different regions). Sourcing different commodities or different locations allows shippers to substitute different carriers and such competition may reduce our volume or constrain  prices. Additionally,  any  future  consolidation  of  the  rail  industry  could  materially  affect  our  competitive environment.\n\nWe  May  Be  Affected  by  Climate  Change  and  Market  or  Regulatory  Responses  to  Climate  Change -  Climate change, including the impact of global warming, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Restrictions, caps, taxes, or other controls on emissions of GHGs, including diesel exhaust, could significantly increase our operating costs. Restrictions on emissions could also affect our customers that  (a)  use  commodities that we carry to produce energy, (b) use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering  the  commodities  we  carry,  or  (c)  manufacture  or  produce  goods  that  consume  significant  amounts  of energy or burn fossil fuels, including chemical producers, farmers and food producers, and automakers and other manufacturers. Significant cost increases, government regulation, or changes of consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy, emissions reductions, and GHG emissions could materially affect the markets for the commodities we carry and demand for our services, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Government incentives encouraging the use of alternative  sources  of  energy  also  could  affect  certain  of  our  customers  and  the  markets  for  certain  of  the commodities  we  carry  in  an  unpredictable  manner  that  could  alter  our  traffic  patterns,  including,  for  example, increasing royalties charged to producers of PRB coal by the U.S. Department of Interior and the impacts of ethanol incentives  on  farming  and  ethanol  producers.  We  could  face  increased  costs  related  to  defending  and  resolving legal  claims  and  other  litigation  related  to  climate  change  and  the  alleged  impact  of  our  operations  on  climate change.  Violent  weather  caused  by  climate  change,  including  earthquakes,  hurricanes,  fires,  floods,  extreme temperatures,  avalanches,  and  significant  precipitation  could  cause  line  outages  and  other  interruptions  to  our infrastructure.  Any  of  these  factors,  individually  or  in  operation  with  one  or  more  of  the  other  factors,  or  other unforeseen impacts of climate change could reduce the amount of traffic we handle and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. While we work to implement our Climate Action Plan, our efforts to achieve emission reduction targets could significantly increase our operational costs and capital expenditures.",

      "question": "How does the use of comparable company data in goodwill impairment testing differ between 3M and UPS, and what specific financial implications arise from these differences in their 2024 reporting?",
      "answer": "3M uses comparable company EBITDA multiples in its market approach for goodwill impairment testing and reported $6.3 billion in total goodwill as of December 31, 2024, with impairment testing based on whether the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. UPS also uses a market approach with comparable company data but applies it to enterprise value to net sales multiples rather than EBITDA. UPS noted that three reporting units (Roadie, Global Freight Forwarding, and Global Logistics and Distribution) totaling $1.1 billion of its $4.3 billion consolidated goodwill balance showed limited excess of fair value over carrying value, indicating a higher risk of future impairment if forecasts are not met or the cost of capital increases. Thus, while both companies use comparable company data in goodwill impairment testing, the financial implication for UPS is a more immediate risk of impairment on a significant portion of its goodwill, whereas 3M's $6.3 billion in goodwill was not reported to have any impairment in 2024, though it acknowledged potential future non-cash impairment charges.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - 3M uses EBITDA multiples from comparable companies for goodwill impairment testing and reported $6.3 billion in total goodwill as of December 31, 2024.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies use a market approach with comparable company data for goodwill impairment testing, but the specific financial metrics and risk profiles differ: 3M\u2019s total goodwill is higher ($6.3B) and no impairment was recorded in 2024, while UPS has a portion of its goodwill ($1.1B) at risk due to limited excess of fair value over carrying value."

          "chunk_text": "\n## Expected return on plan assets\n\nThe expected return on plan assets for the primary U.S. qualified pension plan is based on strategic asset allocation of the plan, long-term capital market return expectations, and expected performance from active investment management. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2025 is 8.00%, an increase from the weighted average of 7.63% in 2024. Return on assets assumptions for international pension and other postretirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions. The weighted average expected return for the international pension plans is 5.00% for 2025 compared to 5.31% for 2024. Changes in asset allocation and market performance over time, among other factors, cause these estimates to be subject to uncertainty.\n\nIn 2024 for continuing operations, the Company recognized pre-tax defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit service cost expense of $194 million and nonservice pension and postretirement net benefit costs (including settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) of $828 million for a total pre-tax continuing operations defined benefit pension and postretirement expense of $1,022 million, up from $113 million in 2023. The 2024 amounts include the impacts of remeasurements of pension and postretirement pension plans during the year and $0.8 billion pension settlement charge associated the pension risk transfer special item (all discussed in Note 15).\n\nAssessments of Goodwill: The Company makes certain estimates and judgments in impairment assessments of goodwill. As of December 31, 2024, 3M goodwill totaled approximately $6.3 billion. G oodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year and is tested between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. If future non-cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3M would expect that only a portion of the goodwill would be impaired.\n\nImpairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but are required to be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. At 3M, reporting units correspond to a division. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit's net assets ex ceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, and the loss would equal that difference. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined based on a market approach using comparable company information such as EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) multiples. 3M also performs a discounted cash flow analysis for certain reporting units if the market approach indicates additional review is warranted. A discounted cash flow analysis involves key assumptions including projected sales, EBITDA margins, capital expenditures, and discount rates. Changes in reporting unit earnings, comparable company information, and expected future cash flows, as well as underlying market and overall economic conditions, among other factors, make these estimates subject to uncertainty.",

The projections that we use in our DCF model are updated annually, or more often if necessary, and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units.\n- The market approach uses observable market data of comparable public companies to estimate fair value utilizing financial metrics (such as enterprise value to net sales). We apply judgment to select appropriate comparison companies based on the business operations, size and operating results of our reporting units. Changes to our selection of comparable companies or market multiples may result in changes to the estimates of fair value of our reporting units.\n\nIn 2024, we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing using both qualitative and quantitative methods. As of our July 1 testing date, we concluded the fair value of each reporting unit ex ceeded its carrying value; however, three reporting units (Roadie, G lobal Freight Forwarding, and Global Logistics and Distribution) exhibited limited ex cess of fair value and thus reflect a greater risk of impairment occurring in future periods. Approx imately $1.1 billion of our consolidated goodwill balance of $4.3 billion is represented by these three reporting units.\n\nIn addition to forecasted and actual business performance, our valuation estimates are most sensitive to changes in cost of capital. For the reporting units we have identified as having limited cushion above, if the cost of capital were increased by 100 basis points or our projected cash flows were reduced by 10 percent, it is reasonably possible that these reporting units would be impaired. We believe the fair values of our Roadie, Global Freight Forwarding, and Global Logistics and Distribution reporting units continue to exceed their respective carrying values. However, if the businesses do not meet forecasts or cost of capital requirements increase, we may incur future impairment charges. We continue to monitor all of our reporting units between annual testing dates.\n\nWe did not record any goodwill impairments during 2024. During 2023, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $56 million related to Roadie and $61 million related to Delivery Solutions. The Delivery Solutions impairment represented all of the goodwill associated with this reporting unit. These charges are included within Other expenses in the statement of consolidated income. We did not incur any goodwill impairment charges in 2022.\n\nOur finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. These assets are tested for impairment as part of asset groups that may include other long-lived assets. See \"Critical Accounting Estimates - Depreciation, Residual Value and Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment\" for a discussion of estimates impacting asset groups. In addition, a reduction in expected useful life, or a decision to sell or abandon an intangible asset before the end of its useful life, may increase amortization expense, which could have a material impact on our results of operations. As a result of our strategic actions under our Efficiency Reimagined initiatives, we are reviewing our software application infrastructure and ex pect that as result of this review, it is reasonably possible that revisions to the useful lives of certain finite-lived intangible assets will occur in future periods. See note 7 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for a discussion of finitelived intangible asset impairments.\n\n## Self-Insurance Accruals\n\nWe base self-insurance reserves on actuarial estimates, which are determined with the assistance of a third-party actuary through a complex process that includes the application of various actuarial methods and assumptions. The process incorporates actual loss experience and judgments about expected future development based on historical experience, recent and projected trends in claim frequency and severity, changes in the level of risk retained under our programs and changes in claims handling practices, among other factors.\n\nWorkers' compensation, automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take a number of years to resolve. Consequently, actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to resolve a claim. Several factors can affect the actual cost, or severity, of a claim, including:\n\n- Risk retention limits;\n- Length of time a claim remains open;\n- Trends in healthcare and litigation costs;\n- Results of any related litigation; and\n- Changes in legislation.",

While both companies include these obligations in accounts payable, the difference in scale and structure\u2014such as UPS\u2019s lack of guarantees or direct financial relationships with institutions\u2014suggests that UPS takes a more hands-off approach to supplier financing, whereas 3M has a more active program with early payment arrangements facilitated through participating banks.",

Supplier Finance Program Obligations\n\nUnder supplier finance programs, 3M agrees to pay participating banks the stated amount of confirmed invoices from its designated suppliers on the original maturity dates of the invoices, generally within 90 days of the invoice date. 3M or the banks may terminate the agreements with advance notice. Separately, the banks may have arrangements with the suppliers that provide them the option to request early payment from the banks for invoices confirmed by 3M. 3M's outstanding balances of confirmed invoices in the programs as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were approximately $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively. These amounts are included within accounts payable on 3M's consolidated balance sheet. The activity in 2024 included approximately $1.5 billion of invoices confirmed and $1.5 billion of invoices paid and other adjustments.\n\n## NOTE 17. Derivatives\n\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated with interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The information that follows explains the various types of derivatives and financial instruments used by 3M, how and why 3M uses such instruments, how such instruments are accounted for, and how such instruments impact 3M's financial position and performance.\n\nAdditional information with respect to derivatives is included elsewhere as follows:\n\n- Impact on other comprehensive income of non-derivative hedging and derivative instruments is included in Note 9.\n- Fair value of derivative instruments is included in Note 18.\n- Derivatives and/or hedging instruments associated with the Company's long-term debt are also described in Note 14.\n\nRefer to the section below titled Location on Statement of Income (Loss) and Impact of Cash Flow and Fair Value Derivative Instruments and Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments for details on the location within the consolidated statements of income (loss) for amounts of gains and losses related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow or fair value hedges (along with similar information relative to the hedged items) and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. Additional information relative to cash flow hedges, fair value hedges, net investment hedges and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is included below as applicable.\n\nCash Flow Hedges: For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.\n\nCash Flow Hedging - Foreign Currency Forward and Option Contracts: The Company may enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of ex change rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. The settlement or extension of these derivatives will result in reclassifications (from accumulated other comprehensive income) to earnings in the period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. 3M may de-designate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction. The Company may de-designate a cash flow hedge if the forecasted transaction is no longer probable, if 3M determines that the hedge is no longer expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the forecasted transaction, or in certain other circumstances. The portion of gains or losses on the derivative instrument previously included in accumulated other comprehensive income for de-designated hedges remains in accumulated other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs or becomes probable of not occurring. Changes in the value of derivative instruments after de-designation are recorded in earnings and are included in the Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments section below. The maximum length of time over which 3M hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions is 36 months.\n\nCash Flow Hedging - Interest Rate Contracts: The Company may use forward starting interest rate contracts and treasury rate lock contracts to hedge exposure to variability in cash flows from interest payments on forecasted debt issuances.\n\nThe amortization of gains and losses on forward starting interest rate swaps is included in the tables below as part of the gain/(loss) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into income.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had a balance of $15 million associated with the after-tax net unrealized loss associated with cash flow hedging instruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). This includes a remaining balance of $80 million (after-tax loss) related to forward starting interest rate swap and treasury rate lock contracts terminated in 2019 concurrent with associated debt issuances, which is being amortized over the respective lives of the underlying notes. Based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2024, of the total after-tax net unrealized balance as of December 31, 2024, 3M expects to reclassify approximately $44 million after-tax  net unrealized gain over the nex t 12 months (with the impact offset by earnings/losses from underlying hedged items).",

Capitalized software is generally amortized over 7 years. Finite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment as part of asset groups whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable.\n\n## Assets Held for Sale\n\nWe classify long-lived assets or disposal groups as held for sale in the period when all of the following conditions have been met:\n\n- we have approved and committed to a plan to sell the assets or disposal group;\n- the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition;\n- an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the sale have been initiated;\n- the sale of the asset or disposal group is probable and expected to be completed within one year;\n- the asset or disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and\n- it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.\n\nWe initially measure a long-lived asset or disposal group that is classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell and recognize any loss in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met. G ains are not recognized until the date of sale. We cease depreciation and amortization of a long-lived asset, or assets within a disposal group, upon their designation as held for sale and subsequently assess fair value less any costs to sell at each reporting date until the asset or disposal group is no longer classified as held for sale.\n\n## Supplier Finance Programs\n\nAs part of our working capital management, certain financial institutions offer a Supply Chain Finance (\"SCF\") program to certain of our suppliers. We agree to commercial terms with our suppliers, including prices, quantities and payment terms, regardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in the SCF program. Suppliers issue invoices to us based on the agreed-upon contractual terms. If they participate in the SCF program, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, determine which invoices, if any, to sell to the financial institutions. Our suppliers' voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms. No guarantees are provided by us under the SCF program. We have no economic interest in a supplier's decision to participate, and we have no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions, as it relates to the SCF program.\n\nAmounts due to our suppliers that participate in the SCF program are included in Accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets.

SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION\n\nWe have two reportable segments: U.S. Domestic Package and International Package, which are together referred to as our global small package operations. Our remaining businesses are reported as Supply Chain Solutions. Global small package operations represent our most significant business and are broken down into regional operations around the world. Regional operations managers are responsible for both domestic and export products within their geographic area. Supply Chain Solutions comprises the results of non-reportable operating segments that do not meet the quantitative and qualitative criteria of a reportable segment as defined under ASC Topic 280.\n\n## U.S. Domestic Package\n\nU.S. Domestic Package operations include the time-definite delivery of letters, documents and packages throughout the United States.\n\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2024, based on a change in our management reporting structure, we began presenting our U.S. air cargo product within our U.S. Domestic Package segment. This activity was previously reported within Supply Chain Solutions. This change aligns with how our chief operating decision maker reviews operating results to assess performance and allocate resources. Prior periods have been recast to conform to current year presentation with no changes to consolidated results.\n\n## International Package\n\nInternational Package operations include delivery to more than 200 countries and territories worldwide, including shipments wholly outside the United States, as well as shipments with either origin or destination outside the United States. Our International Package reporting segment includes the aggregation of our operations in Europe, the Indian sub-continent, Middle East and Africa (together \"EMEA\"), Canada and Latin America (together \"Americas\") and Asia.\n\n## Supply Chain Solutions\n\nSupply Chain Solutions includes our Forwarding, Logistics, digital and other businesses. Our Forwarding and Logistics businesses provide services in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide and include international air and ocean freight forwarding, customs brokerage, mail services, healthcare logistics, distribution and post-sales services. Our digital businesses leverage technology to enable a range of on-demand services such as same-day delivery, end-to-end return services and integrated supply chain and high-value shipment insurance solutions.\n\n## Segment information\n\nWe consider our Chief Executive Officer to be our chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\"). The CODM is responsible for setting the Company's strategic direction, managing overall operations, and is the main point of communication between the board of directors and key operational personnel within the organization.\n\nThe CODM utilizes operating profit as a primary measure of segment performance because it reflects the underlying business performance and provides the CODM with a basis for making resource allocation decisions. Operating profit is defined as income before investment income (expense) and other, interest expense and income tax expense. Operating profit is considered to be a primary measure of segment performance.\n\nThe CODM regularly reviews segment level expense details which include compensation, benefits and purchased transportation expenses when assessing operating segment performance. Compensation and benefits are separately assessed for Domestic Package whereas these categories are assessed together for International Package. These categories are the primary segment expenses used by the CODM to assesses segment performance.\n\nCertain expenses are allocated between the segments using activity-based costing methods. These activity-based costing methods require us to make estimates that impact the amount of each expense category that is attributed to each segment. Changes in these estimates directly impact the amount of expense allocated to each segment, and therefore the operating profit of each reporting segment. Our allocation methodologies are refined periodically, as necessary, to reflect changes in our businesses.\n\nAs we operate an integrated, global multimodal network, we evaluate many of our capital expenditure decisions at a network level. Accordingly, expenditures on property, plant and equipment by segment are not presented.",

      "answer": "MMM is significantly impacted by monetary policy through its 56% international revenue exposure, where foreign exchange fluctuations can materially affect its sales and earnings growth projections. UPS, while also affected by monetary policy indirectly through global trade and regulatory changes, faces increasing compliance costs due to international climate regulations such as ReFuelEU Aviation, which mandates a 2% SAF target in 2025 rising to 70% by 2050, potentially increasing fuel costs and operating expenses significantly.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - MMM's 56% of revenues come from outside the U.S., making it highly sensitive to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and global economic conditions influenced by monetary policy.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - UPS faces rising operating costs due to international regulations like ReFuelEU Aviation, which mandates increasing use of sustainable aviation fuel starting at 2% in 2025, and is also impacted by trade policies and monetary policy through compliance and cost structures.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are affected by monetary policy, but through different mechanisms: MMM through foreign exchange and global demand volatility, and UPS through regulatory-driven cost increases and trade policy uncertainty."

Actual future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those reflected in any such forward-looking statements depending on a variety of factors. Important information as to these factors can be found in this document, including, among others, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' under the headings of 'Overview,' 'Financial Condition and Liquidity' and annually in 'Critical Accounting Estimates.' Discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference from Part I, Item 1A, 'Risk Factors,' of this document, and should be considered an integral part of Part II, Item 7, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.' For additional information concerning factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements, see our reports on Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filed with the SEC from time to time.\n\n## Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\nProvided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the Company. Discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of Part II, Item 7, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.'\n\n## Risks Related to the Global Economy and External Conditions\n\n* The Company's results are impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic, political, regulatory, international trade, geopolitical, and other external conditions.\n\nDuring 2024, the Company derived approximately 56 percent of its revenues from outside the United States. Accordingly, the Company's operations and the execution of its business strategies and plans are subject to global competition and economic and geopolitical risks that are beyond its control, such as, among other things, disruptions in financial markets, economic downturns, military conflicts, terrorism, public health emergencies, political changes and trends such as protectionism, economic nationalism resulting in government actions impacting international trade agreements or imposing trade restrictions such as tariffs and retaliatory counter measures, and government deficit reduction and other austerity measures in locations or industries in which the Company operates. Further escalation of specific trade tensions, including those between the U.S. and China, or more broadly in global trade conflict, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and operations around the world. The Company's business is also impacted by social, political, and labor conditions in locations in which the Company or its suppliers or customers operate; adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital; monetary policy; interest rates; inflation; recession; commodity prices; currency volatility or exchange control; ability to expatriate earnings; and other laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company or its suppliers or customers operate. For example, changes in local economic condition or outlooks, such as lower economic growth rates in China, Europe, or other key markets, impact the demand or profitability of the Company's products.\n\nThe global economy has been impacted by geopolitical tensions. The U.S. and other governments have imposed export controls on certain products and financial and economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in certain conflict zones. These geopolitical tensions could result in, among other things, cyberattacks, supply chain disruptions, higher energy and other commodity costs, lower consumer demand, and changes to foreign exchange rates and financial markets, any of which may have a material adverse effect the Company's business and supply chain.\n\nClimate change and severe weather events, including related environmental and social regulations, as well as natural disasters, may negatively impact the Company or its customers and suppliers, in terms of availability and cost of natural resources, sources and supply of energy, product demand and manufacturing, compliance costs, and the health and well-being of individuals and communities in which we or our suppliers or customers operate.\n\n* Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company's ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings.\n\nThe Company's financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and, as noted above, the Company derives a significant percentage of its revenues from outside the United States. As a result, the Company's results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be materially adversely impacted if the U.S. dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies, and the Company's results of operations may experience volatility related to changes in ex change rates. For a discussion of the impact of foreign currency ex change rates on the Company, see Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\n\n## Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Proceedings\n\n* The Company faces liabilities related to certain fluorochemicals, which could have a material adverse effect on our results.\n\nAs previously reported, governments in the United States and internationally have increasingly been regulating a broad group of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances produced by the Company, collectively known as 'PFAS,' including some presently or historically produced by the Company.",

          "chunk_text": "We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in many jurisdictions. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue may make resolving tax disputes more difficult. The final determination of tax  audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax  provisions and accruals. In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax  laws, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, and changes in taxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions may materially adversely impact our tax  ex pense and cash flows.\n\n## Regulatory and Legal Risks\n\n## Increasingly complex and stringent laws, regulations and policies could materially increase our operating costs.\n\nWe are subject to complex and stringent aviation, transportation, environmental, security, labor, employment, safety, privacy, disclosure and data protection and other governmental laws, regulations and policies, both in the U.S. and internationally. In addition, we are impacted by laws, regulations and policies that affect global trade, including tariff and trade policies, ex port requirements, embargoes, sanctions, tax es, monetary policies and other restrictions and charges. Trade discussions and arrangements between the U.S. and various of its trading partners are fluid, and existing and future trade agreements are, and are expected to continue to be, subject to a number of uncertainties, including the imposition of new tariffs or adjustments and changes to the products covered by existing tariffs. The impact of new laws, regulations and policies or decisions or interpretations by authorities applying those laws and regulations, cannot be predicted. Compliance with any new laws, regulations or policies may increase our operating costs or require significant capital ex penditures. Any failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or policies in the U.S. or other countries could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations, which could materially adversely affect us. For ex ample, as previously disclosed, the SEC recently investigated our controls and practices surrounding impairment analyses in connection with the divestiture of UPS Freight in April 2021. On November 22, 2024, we entered into a settlement with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC's findings in connection with alleged violations of Section 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (and related provisions), resolving the investigation. Under the terms of the settlement, we agreed to pay a civil penalty, and agreed to remedial actions, training and process changes.\n\n## Increasingly stringent regulations related to climate change, including reporting obligations, could materially increase our operating costs.\n\nRegulation and required disclosures of greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions and related matters exposes us to potentially significant new taxes, fees, disclosure and compliance obligations and other costs. Compliance with such regulation, and any increased or additional regulation, or the associated costs is further complicated by the fact that various countries and regions may adopt different approaches to climate change regulation and disclosures.\n\nIn the U.S., Congress has considered but, to date, not passed various bills that would regulate GHG emissions. Nevertheless, we believe some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future. Even in the absence of such legislation, the Environmental Protection Agency could determine to regulate GHG emissions, especially aircraft or diesel engine emissions, and this could impose substantial costs on us.\n\nInternational regulations also continue to increase and could materially increase our operating costs. For example, the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, a European regulation, mandates jet fuel suppliers in Europe supply a target percentage of sustainable aviation fuel ('SAF') at airports inside the European Union. The SAF target percentage starts at 2% in 2025 and increases to 70% by 2050. The cost of SAF can be higher than conventional jet fuel, and these suppliers can pass this cost along to purchasers, which can increase our operating costs, potentially significantly. In addition, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (\"CORSIA\"), a global, market-based emissions offset program to encourage carbon-neutral growth began a voluntary pilot phase in 2021, with mandatory participation scheduled to begin in 2027. Details regarding implementation of CORSIA continue to develop, and compliance may increase our operating costs, potentially significantly.\n\nIn addition, in January 2025, the President of the U.S. signed an ex ecutive order indicating that the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris Climate Accords. The effect that the withdrawal may have on future U.S. policy regarding GHG emissions, on CORSIA and on other GHG regulation remains uncertain. The extent to which other countries implement those accords could also have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nIncreased regulation relating to GHG emissions in the U.S. or abroad, especially aircraft, gasoline or diesel engine emissions, could, among other things, increase the cost of fuel and other energy we purchase and the capital costs associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicles prematurely. We cannot predict the impact any future regulation will have on our cost structure or our operating results. It is likely that such regulation could significantly increase our operating costs and",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Foreign Currency Translation and Remeasurement\n\nWe translate the results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries using average exchange rates for each period, whereas balance sheet accounts are translated using exchange rates at the end of each period. Balance sheet currency translation adjustments are recorded in other comprehensive income. Pre-tax foreign currency transaction gains (losses) from remeasurement, net of hedging, included in Investment income (expense) and other were $(38), $(53) and $72 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nShare-based awards are measured based on their fair values and expensed over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (the vesting period), less estimated forfeitures. We have issued employee share-based awards under various incentive compensation plans that contain vesting conditions, including service conditions, where the awards cliff vest after one or three years or vest ratably over periods up to five years (the \"nominal vesting period\") or at the date the employee retires (as defined by the plan), if earlier. As of December 31, 2023, we had no outstanding share-based awards cliff vesting after one year. See note 13 for further discussion of our share-based awards. Compensation cost is generally recognized immediately for certain awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, or over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved, if that is ex pected to occur during the nominal vesting period. For awards with a performance-based condition, expense is recognized based on probability of performance achievement. We estimate forfeiture rates based on historical rates of forfeitures for awards with similar characteristics, historical and projected rates of employee turnover and the nature and terms of the vesting conditions of the awards. We reevaluate our forfeiture rates on an annual basis.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nOur financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis have been categorized based upon a fair value hierarchy. Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are based on other observable market data, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as interest rates and yield curves. Level 3 inputs are developed from unobservable data reflecting our own assumptions, and include situations where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability. Certain investments described further in note 5, that do not have a readily determinable fair value, are measured at net asset value (\"NAV\") using NAV as a practical expedient or an equivalent developed consistent with the measurement principles in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820. Plan assets that are measured using NAV as a practical expedient are excluded from the fair value hierarchy.\n\nCertain non-financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including property, plant, and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. These assets are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is an impairment.\n\nFor business acquisitions, we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and identified intangible assets based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. During the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Following the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\n\n## Derivative Instruments\n\nWe recognize all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, further, on the type of hedging relationship. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, we designate the derivative as a cash flow hedge, a fair value hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation based upon the exposure being hedged.\n\n- A cash flow hedge refers to hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income, and reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.",

      "answer": "Global supply chain disruption had measurable financial effects on both 3M and UPS. For 3M, the disruption contributed to increased raw materials and logistics costs, which were further magnified by extreme weather events such as the February 2021 winter storm Uri in the U.S. These factors led to a 1.5 percentage point decrease in 3M's operating income margins year-on-year for the year ending December 31, 2021. For UPS, global supply chain disruption caused capacity constraints that drove higher transportation costs, particularly in its Supply Chain Solutions business segment. These disruptions directly affected UPS's operations, contributing to increased costs and influencing its overall financial performance.",

Refer to the Performance by Business Segment section later in MD&amp;A for additional discussion of sales by segment.\n\n3M's operating income margins decreased 1.5 percentage points year-on-year for the year ending December 31, 2021. Factoring out the impact on operating income of special items as described in the Certain amounts adjusted for special items -(non-GAAP measures) section below, operating income margins decreased 0.5 percentage points to 20.8 percent for the year ending December 31, 2021 when compared to 2020. Various COVID-19 implications contributed in part to these results.\n\nOverall, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 3M's consolidated results of operations was primarily driven by factors related to changes in demand for products and disruption in global supply chains. While it is not feasible to identify or quantify all the other direct and indirect implications on 3M's results of operations, below are factors that 3M believes have also affected its 2021 results when compared to 2020:\n\nFactors contributing to charges or other impacts:\n\n- Increased raw materials and logistics costs from ongoing COVID-19 related global supply chain challenges further magnified by extreme weather events, such as February 2021 winter storm Uri in the United States.\n- Cost management in discretionary spending in areas such as travel, professional services, and advertising/merchandising resulting in lower spending in 2020.\n- Government-sponsored COVID-response stimulus and relief initiatives in 2020, including certain employee retention benefits under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act in the United States.\n- Lower incentive compensation and self-insured medical visit/insurance expense in 2020.\n\n## Factors providing benefits or other impacts:\n\n- Continued productivity efforts, including year-on-year savings from restructuring actions taken in 2020 and 2021.\n- Period expenses of unabsorbed manufacturing costs and increased expected credit losses on customer receivables in 2020.\n- Restructuring actions addressing structural enterprise costs and operations in certain end markets as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic impact resulting in a 2020 charge of $58 million.\n- Committed financial support in 2020 to various COVID-relief and medical research initiatives.\n- Charge of $22 million in 2020 related to equity securities as discussed in the 'Assets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis' section of Note 15 that use the measurement alternative described therein in addition to an immaterial pre-tax charge related to impairment of certain indefinite lived tradenames.\n\nRefer to the Financial Condition and Liquidity section below for more information on the Company's liquidity position.\n\nDue to the speed with which the COVID-19 situation is developing and evolving and the uncertainty of its duration and the timing of recovery, 3M is not able at this time to predict the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition.",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n## Overview\n\nWe are on a journey to execute our Customer First, People Led, Innovation Driven strategy within our Better not Bigger framework. We are focused on improving revenue quality, reducing our cost to serve, growing operating profit and allocating capital in a disciplined fashion. The Customer First component of our strategy focuses on, among other things, enhancing the capabilities that we believe our customers value the most: speed and ease of access to our services. The People Led component of our strategy aims to enhance the employee value proposition. Our Innovation Driven strategic approach utilizes technology and automation to deliver sustainable improvements to our network and to enhance the customer experience.\n\nWe have two reportable segments: U.S. Domestic Package and International Package, which are together referred to as our global small package operations. Our remaining businesses are reported as Supply Chain Solutions. For the year, we increased average daily volume, revenue per piece and operating margin within global small package operations, with growth led by smalland medium-sized businesses (\"SMBs\") as we executed on our strategy. The COVID-19 pandemic continued to have, and is expected to continue to have, an impact on our business. We experienced a year-over-year increase in commercial volume as business returned to pre-pandemic levels, while business-to-consumer volume declined, partly due to the surge in e-commerce at the onset of the pandemic. In the second half of the year, COVID-19 resulted in a reduction in the number of flights we operated in Asia relative to our expectations, which contributed to an overall decline in international volume in the fourth quarter. Within Supply Chain Solutions, operating margin increased with demand for our services particularly strong in Forwarding and healthcare logistics, including COVID-19 relief efforts.\n\nThe overall economic environment continues to be challenging. Global supply chain disruption continues, and resulted in capacity constraints that drove higher transportation costs, particularly in our Supply Chain Solutions businesses. Rising inflation and labor market challenges continue to cause wage pressures in certain markets. We continue to monitor the impacts of these external conditions on our business; however, we anticipate that demand for our services will remain strong.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, following enactment of the American Rescue Plan Act (\"ARPA\"), we remeasured the UPS/IBT Full Time Employee Pension Plan. This resulted in a $3.3 billion pre-tax mark-to-market gain in the first quarter. We completed the divestiture of UPS Freight on April 30, 2021, and used the cash proceeds of $848 million to reduce outstanding indebtedness. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $46 million for the year in respect of this transaction. The divestiture triggered a remeasurement of certain of our U.S. defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans, which had only an immaterial impact on results of operations for the year. For additional information on this divestiture, see note 4 to the audited, consolidated financial statements. Following the divestiture, we renamed our Supply Chain &amp; Freight businesses Supply Chain Solutions.\n\nIn October 2021, we completed the acquisition of Roadie, a technology platform focused on same-day delivery services, for $586 million. The results of Roadie are reported within Supply Chain Solutions. The acquisition did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the year. See note 9 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for additional information on this transaction.",

These swaps, as well as $700 million of notional amount in existing outstanding swaps had been designated as hedges against interest rate volatility associated with forecasted issuances of fixed rate debt. Concurrent with the issuance of the medium-term notes in February 2019 and the additional issuance of registered notes in August 2019, 3M terminated all outstanding interest rate swaps related to forecasted issuances of debt. These terminations resulted in a net loss of $143 million within accumulated other comprehensive income that will be amortized over the respective lives of the debt.\n\nIn March 2020, the Company entered into treasury rate lock contracts with a notional amount of $500 million that were terminated concurrently with the March 2020 issuance of registered notes as discussed in Note 12. The termination resulted in an immaterial net loss within accumulated other comprehensive income that will be amortized for the respective lives of the debt.\n\nThe amortization of gains and losses on forward starting interest rate swaps is included in the tables below as part of the gain/(loss) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into income.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had a balance of $54 million associated with the after-tax net unrealized loss associated with cash flow hedging instruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. This includes a remaining balance of $100 million (after-tax loss) related to the forward starting interest rate swap and treasury rate lock contacts, which will be amortized over the respective lives of the notes. Based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2021, of the total after-tax net unrealized balance as of December 31, 2021, 3M expects to reclassify approximately $22 million after-tax net unrealized gain over the next 12 months (with the impact offset by earnings/losses from underlying hedged items).\n\nThe amount of pretax gain (loss) recognized in other comprehensive income related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges is provided in the following table.\n\n",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nWe also hedge portions of our anticipated cash settlements of intercompany transactions and interest payments on certain debt subject to foreign currency remeasurement using foreign currency forward contracts. We normally designate and account for these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions; therefore, the resulting gains and losses from these hedges are recognized as a component of Investment income (expense) and other when the underlying transactions are subject to currency remeasurement.\n\nWe hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations with foreign currency denominated debt instruments. The use of foreign denominated debt as the hedging instrument allows the debt to be remeasured to foreign currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive income to offset the translation risk from those investments. Balances in the cumulative translation adjustment accounts remain until the sale or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity, upon which they are recognized as a component of Investment income (expense) and other .\n\n## Interest Rate Risk Management\n\nOur indebtedness under our various financing arrangements creates interest rate risk. We use a combination of derivative instruments as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. Interest rate swaps allow us to maintain a target range of floating-rate debt within our capital structure. The notional amount, interest payment date and maturity date of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt being hedged.\n\nWe have designated and account for the majority of our interest rate swaps that convert fixed-rate interest payments into floating-rate interest payments as fair value hedges of the associated debt instruments. Therefore, the gains and losses resulting from fair value adjustments to the interest rate swaps and fair value adjustments to the associated debt instruments are recorded to interest expense in the period in which the gains and losses occur. We have designated and account for interest rate swaps that convert floating-rate interest payments into fixed-rate interest payments as cash flow hedges of the forecasted payment obligations. The gains and losses resulting from fair value adjustments to these interest rate swaps are recorded to other comprehensive income.\n\nWe periodically hedge the forecasted fixed-coupon interest payments associated with anticipated debt offerings by using forward starting interest rate swaps, interest rate locks or similar derivatives. These agreements effectively lock a portion of our interest rate exposure between the time the agreement is entered into and the date when the debt offering is completed, thereby mitigating the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense. These derivatives are settled commensurate with the issuance of the debt, and any gain or loss upon settlement is amortized as an adjustment to the effective interest yield on the debt.\n\n## Outstanding Positions\n\nThe notional amounts of our outstanding derivative positions as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

During the third quarter of 2020, the Company paid the outstanding balances and closed these credit facilities.\n\nThe Company also had an additional $266 million in stand-alone letters of credit and bank guarantees issued and outstanding at December 31, 2021. These instruments are utilized in connection with normal business activities.\n\n## Long-Term Debt Issuances and Fixed-to-Floating Interest Rate Swaps\n\nThe principal amounts, interest rates and maturity dates of individual long-term debt issuances can be found in the long-term debt table found at the beginning of this note.\n\nDuring the second and third quarters of 2021, 3M entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $800 million. These swaps converted $500 million and $300 million of 3M's $1.0 billion and $650 million principal amount of fixed rate notes due 2049 and 2050, respectively, into floating rate debt for the portion of their terms through mid-2028 with an interest rate based on a three-month LIBOR index.\n\nIn March 2020, 3M issued $1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed rate registered notes. These were comprised of $500 million of 5-year notes due 2025 with a coupon rate of 2.65%, $600 million of 10-year notes due 2030 with a coupon rate of 3.05%, and $650 million of 30-year notes due 2050 with a coupon rate of 3.70%.\n\nIn February 2019, 3M issued $2.25 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed rate medium-term notes. These were comprised of $450 million of 3-year notes due 2022 with a coupon rate of 2.75%, $500 million of remaining 5-year notes due 2024 with a coupon rate of 3.25%, $800 million of 10-year notes due 2029 with a coupon rate of 3.375%, and $500 million of remaining 29.5year notes due 2048 with a coupon rate of 4.00%. Issuances of the 5-year and 29.5-year notes were pursuant to a reopening of existing securities issued in September 2018.\n\nIn August 2019, 3M issued $3.25 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed rate registered notes. These were comprised of $500 million of 3.5-year notes due 2023 with a coupon rate of 1.75%, $750 million of 5.5-year notes due 2025 with a coupon rate of 2.00%, $1.0 billion of 10-year notes due 2029 with a coupon rate of 2.375%, and $1.0 billion of 30-year notes due 2049 with a coupon rate of 3.25%.\n\n## Long-Term Debt Maturities and Extinguishments\n\nIn November 2021, 3M repaid 600 million euros aggregate principal amount of Eurobonds that matured.\n\nIn March 2021, 3M, via a make-whole-call offer, redeemed $450 million principal amount of 2.75% notes due 2022. The Company recorded an early debt extinguishment pre-tax charge of approximately $11 million within interest expense. This charge reflected the differential between the carrying value and the amount paid to reacquire the notes and related expenses.\n\nIn December 2020, 3M, via make-whole-call offers, repaid $1 billion aggregate principal amount of its outstanding notes. This included $400 million aggregate principal amount of 3.00% notes and $600 million aggregate principal amount of 1.625% notes, both of which were due to mature in 2021. The Company recorded an early debt extinguishment pre-tax charge of approximately $10 million within interest expense. This charge reflected the differential between the carrying value and the amount paid to reacquire the notes and related expenses.\n\nIn May 2020, 3M repaid 650 million euros aggregate principal amount of floating-rate medium-term notes that matured. In August 2020, 3M repaid $500 aggregate principal amount of floating rate medium-term notes that matured.\n\nIn June 2019, 3M repaid $625 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate medium-term notes that matured.\n\nIn 2019, 3M also assumed approximately $2.6 billion of debt in connection with the acquisitions of Acelity and M*Modal (See Note 3) of which $2.1 billion was immediately redeemed or paid at close.\n\n## In-Substance Defeasance\n\nIn conjunction with the October 2019 acquisition of Acelity (see Note 3), 3M assumed outstanding debt of the business, of which $445 million in principal amount of third lien senior secured notes (Third Lien Notes) maturing in 2021 with a coupon rate of 12.5% was not immediately redeemed at closing.

The amount of commercial paper outstanding under these programs in 2022 is expected to fluctuate.\n\n## Debt Repayments\n\nOn January 15, 2021, our 3.125% senior notes with a principal balance of $1.5 billion matured and were repaid in full. On April 1, 2021, our 2.050% fixed-rate senior notes with a principal balance of $700 million and our floating rate senior notes with a principal balance of $350 million matured and were both repaid in full.\n\n## Fixed-Rate Senior Notes\n\nAll of our fixed-rate notes pay interest semi-annually, and allow for redemption by UPS at any time by paying the greater of the principal amount or a 'make-whole' amount, plus accrued interest. We subsequently entered into interest rate swaps on certain of these notes, which effectively converted the fixed interest rates on the notes to variable interest rates. The average interest rates payable on the notes where fixed interest rates were swapped to variable interest rates, including the impact of the interest rate swaps, for 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How does Caterpillar's use of its captive insurance subsidiary Caterpillar Insurance Co. Ltd. for General Liability Insurance differ from 3M's approach in mitigating potential liabilities arising from compliance violations, and what does this imply about their respective risk management strategies?",
      "answer": "Caterpillar utilizes its captive insurance subsidiary, Caterpillar Insurance Co. Ltd., to directly self-insure general liability risks as part of its internal risk management structure. This Bermuda-based subsidiary insures Caterpillar and its affiliates for general liability, among other coverages, allowing Caterpillar to retain control over claims management and potentially reduce premium costs by avoiding external insurers. In contrast, 3M discloses that while it maintains general liability insurance, it acknowledges that potential liabilities from compliance violations\u2014such as those arising from FCPA investigations or data breaches\u2014are unlikely to be fully covered by insurance and may exceed policy limits. This implies that Caterpillar's captive model is designed to proactively internalize and manage risk exposure, while 3M's reliance on traditional insurance is seen as insufficient for full risk transfer in high-severity scenarios, necessitating additional internal compliance measures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, Caterpillar Insurance Co. Ltd. is a captive insurer that provides general liability insurance directly to Caterpillar and its affiliates, indicating an internalized risk management strategy.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, 3M states that general liability insurance is maintained but acknowledges that liabilities from compliance risks are unlikely to be fully covered and may exceed policy limits.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the two approaches: Caterpillar's captive model allows for internal risk retention and control, whereas 3M recognizes gaps in external insurance coverage and must supplement with compliance investments and reserves."

The development and use of artificial intelligence may present risks to the Company's business. Also, the rapidly evolving legal and regulatory environment relating to artificial intelligence, in the United States and internationally, could impact the Company's implementation of artificial intelligence technology, and increase compliance costs and the risk of non-compliance. While the Company will seek to develop and use artificial intelligence responsibly, and will attempt to identify and mitigate ethical, privacy, legal or other issues presented by its use, there can be no assurance that the Company will be fully successful in doing so, and may be subject to data breaches, allegations of unauthorized access to, or use of, third party data, information, or intellectual property rights, or other risks, which may lead to financial losses, legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational damage.\n\nThe failure to comply with the FCPA and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations could result in significant civil fines and penalties or criminal sanctions against the Company, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition. These laws and regulations prohibit corrupt payments by the Company's employees, suppliers, vendors, channel partners or agents. The Company is also required to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls under the FCPA's accounting provisions. From time to time, the Company receives reports internally and externally, via various reporting channels deployed by its Ethics and Compliance function or otherwise (such as shareholder communications), about business and other activities that raise compliance or other legal or litigation issues. The Company has in the past, and in the future could be, required to investigate such reports and cooperate with U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities in such investigations, audit, monitor compliance or alter its practices as part of such investigations, and the Company has in the past and may in the future be required to pay fines or penalties related to its practices. While the Company maintains and implements U.S. and international compliance programs, including policies and procedures, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of noncompliance, the Company's employees, suppliers, vendors, channel partners or agents may violate such policies and procedures and engage in practices that contravene relevant laws and regulations.\n\nThe Company's results of operations could experience a material adverse effect if the costs to comply with these evolving treaties, laws, regulations, and requirements are greater than projected by the Company. In addition, the outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings related to compliance with these treaties, laws, regulations, and requirements are difficult to reliably predict, may differ from the Company's ex pectations, and have resulted and may in the future result in, one or more of the following: criminal or civil sanctions, including fines; limitations on the ex tent to which the Company can conduct business; employee and business partner terminations due to policy violations; and private rights of action that result in litigation ex posure, including ex penses and costs incurred in connection with settlement or court proceedings, for the Company. In addition, detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations of these acts is ex pensive and could consume significant time and attention of our senior management. Although the Company maintains general liability insurance to mitigate monetary exposure, the amount of the liability that may result from certain of these risks is unlikely to be fully covered by applicable insurance, and to the ex tent covered, will ex ceed the applicable limits of such insurance. Various factors or developments can lead the Company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or cash flows or its consolidated financial position. In addition, negative publicity related to the matters noted above or other matters involving the Company may negatively impact the Company's reputation. The Company also relies on patent and other intellectual property protection, and challenges to the Company's intellectual property rights, or claims that the Company's activities interfere with the intellectual property rights of a third party, could cause the Company to incur significant expenses to assert or defend against such claims, could result in reduced revenue, and could damage the Company's reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.

      "answer": "MMM updated its mortality assumption in 2023 to the Pri-2012 Mortality Table with White Collar Adjustment, which increased its U.S. pension projected benefit obligation (PBO) and accumulated postretirement benefit obligations by approximately $450 million. This change directly affected MMM\u2019s financial reporting by increasing liabilities. Meanwhile, CAT uses mortality assumptions as part of its actuarial modeling for defined benefit pension plans and recognizes actuarial gains or losses immediately through earnings upon annual remeasurement. If CAT had experienced a similar mortality assumption update, it would have similarly impacted its consolidated financial statements through changes in benefit obligations and earnings volatility. Therefore, both companies are exposed to financial statement variability due to changes in mortality assumptions, with MMM\u2019s update already resulting in a $450 million increase in obligations.",

We determine the product warranty liability by applying historical claim rate ex perience to the current field population and dealer inventory.  G enerally, we base historical claim rates on actual warranty ex perience for each product by machine model/engine size by customer or dealer location (inside or outside North America).  We develop specific rates for each product shipment month and update them monthly based on actual warranty claim experience.  Warranty costs may differ from those estimated if actual claim rates are higher or lower than our historical rates.\n\nProduct liability and insurance loss reserve - We determine these reserves based upon reported claims in process of settlement and actuarial estimates for losses incurred but not reported. Loss reserves, including incurred but not reported reserves, are based on estimates, and ultimate settlements may vary significantly from such estimates due to increased claims frequency or severity over historical levels. The amount of these reserves totaled $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The majority of the balance in both 2024 and 2023 consisted of unearned insurance premiums.\n\nPostretirement benefits -  We  sponsor  defined  benefit  pension  plans  and/or  other  postretirement  benefit  plans  (retirement  healthcare  and  life  insurance)  to employees in many of our locations throughout the world. There are assumptions used in the accounting for these defined benefit plans that include discount rate, expected return on plan assets, expected rate of compensation increase, the future health care trend rate, mortality and other economic and demographic assumptions. The  actuarial  assumptions  we  use  may  change  or  differ  significantly  from  actual  results,  which  may  result  in  a  material  impact  to  our  consolidated  financial statements.\n\nThe effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions are considered actuarial gains or losses. We utilize a mark-tomarket approach in recognizing actuarial gains or losses immediately through earnings upon the annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement.\n\nPrimary actuarial assumptions were determined as follows:\n\n- We use the assumed discount rate to discount future benefit obligations back to today's dollars.  The U.S. discount rate is based on a benefit cash flowmatching approach and represents the rate at which our benefit obligations could effectively be settled as of our measurement date, December 31. The benefit cash flow-matching approach involves analyzing Caterpillar's projected cash flows against a high quality bond yield curve, calculated using a wide population of corporate Aa bonds available on the measurement date. We use a similar approach to determine the assumed discount rate for our most significant  non-U.S.  plans. In estimating the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost, we utilize a full yield curve approach in determining a discount rate. This approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. Discount rates are sensitive to changes in interest rates.\n- The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on our estimate of long-term returns for equities and fixed income securities weighted by the allocation of our plan assets. This rate is impacted by changes in general market conditions, but because it represents a long-term rate, it is not significantly impacted  by  short-term  market  swings. Changes in our allocation of plan assets would also impact this rate. For example, a shift to more fixed income securities would lower the rate. The expected return on plan assets is based on the fair value of plan asset allocations as of our measurement date, December 31.\n- We use the expected rate of compensation increase to develop benefit obligations using projected pay at retirement. It represents average long-term salary increases. This rate is influenced by our long-term compensation policies.\n- The assumed health care trend rate represents the rate at which health care costs are assumed to increase and is based on historical and expected experience. Changes in our projections of future health care costs due to general economic conditions and those specific to health care (e.g., technology driven cost changes) will impact this trend rate.\n- We use the mortality assumption to estimate the life expectancy of plan participants.",

          "chunk_text": "\nThe Company provides a savings account-based postretirement health care benefit to eligible retirees in the U.S. The contributions provided by the Company to the health savings accounts increase 3 percent per year for employees who retired prior to January 1, 2016 and increase 1.5% for employees who retire on or after January 1, 2016. Therefore, the Company no longer has material exposure to health care cost inflation.\n\nThe Company determines the discount rate and related assumption used to measure plan liabilities as of the applicable measurement date for the pension and postretirement benefit plans. The annual measurement date is December 31, but certain events may require a remeasurement as of a particular date. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. The Company sets its rate to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality, fix ed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. Using this methodology, the Company determined a discount rate of 5.64% for the U.S. pension plans and 5.68% for the postretirement benefit plans as of December 31, 2024, which is an increase of 66 percentage points and an increase 0.62 percentage points, respectively, from the rates used as of December 31, 2023. An increase in the discount rate decreases the Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO). The increase in the discount rates during 2024 resulted in an approximate $0.7 billion decrease in benefit obligation for the U.S. pension and postretirement plans in relation to those plans' December 31, 2023 remeasurement. As discussed further below, during 2024 certain events required remeasurements of particular plans.\n\nThe Company measures service cost and interest cost separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. Service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income.\n\nFor the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the Company's assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 7.63% in 2024. Projected returns are based primarily on broad, publicly traded equity and fix ed-income indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management. As of December 31, 2024, the Company's 2025 expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is 8.00%. The expected return assumption is based on the strategic asset allocation of the plan, long term capital market return ex pectations and ex pected performance from active investment management. The 2024 expected long-term rate of return is based on an initial asset allocation assumption of 11% global equities, 13% private equities, 63% fix ed-income securities, and 13% absolute return investments independent of traditional performance benchmarks, along with positive returns from active investment management. The actual net rate of return on plan assets in 2024, 2023 and 2022 was 2.3%, 10.4% and -17.4%, respectively. The average annual actual return on the plan assets over the past 10 and 25 years has been 4.6% and 6.3%, respectively. Return on assets assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions.\n\nThe Society of Actuaries did not release an update to the Scale MP-2021 in 2023 or 2024. For the December 31, 2023 annual valuation, the Company updated the plans' mortality assumption to use the Pri-2012 Mortality Table with White Collar Adjustment. The December 31, 2023 update resulted in an approximate $450 million increase to the U.S. pension PBO and U.S. accumulated postretirement benefit obligations.\n\nIn 2024, primarily in the second quarter, 3M recorded a non-cash pension settlement charge of approximately $808 million reflected in other expense (income), net as a result of transferring approx imately $2.5 billion of its U.S. pension payment obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company. The pension risk transfer required remeasurement of the plan prior to the calculation of the settlement charge. The net impact of the pension risk transfer and the second quarter 2024 remeasurement was a decrease of approximately $220 million in the non-current liability for pensions (and corresponding decrease in accumulated comprehensive loss, before deferred tax es). Assumptions used for this remeasurement included discount rates determined using June 30, 2024 market conditions and calculated using the same methodology as discussed above. Using this methodology, the Company determined a discount rate of 5.43% for the U.S. pension plan as of June 30, 2024. The Company also reduced the expected return on assets assumption determined using June 30, 2024 market conditions and calculated using the same methodology as used at the annual measurement as of December 31, 2023. All other assumptions were consistent with the December 31, 2023 disclosures. This remeasurement impacted net periodic benefit cost for the remainder of 2024.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nUnder certain environmental laws, including the United States Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ('CERCLA') and similar state laws, the Company may be jointly and severally liable, sometimes with other potentially responsible parties, for the costs of investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at current or former facilities and at off-site locations where substances designated as 'hazardous substances' have been released or disposed of. The Company has identified numerous locations, many of which are in the United States, at which it may have some liability for remediation of contamination under applicable environmental laws. As a result of the CERCLA designation of PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances in 2024, and to the ex tent EPA finalizes additional proposals related to PFAS, 3M may be required to undertake additional investigative or remediation activities, including where 3M conducts operations or where 3M has disposed of waste. 3M may also face additional litigation from other entities that have liability under these laws for claims seeking contribution for clean-up costs other entities might have.\n\nThe Company has been voluntarily cooperating with various local, state, federal (primarily the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)), and international agencies in their reviews of the environmental and health effects of certain PFAS produced by the Company. 3M currently is defending lawsuits concerning various PFAS-related products and chemistries, and is subject to unasserted and asserted claims and governmental regulatory proceedings and inquiries related to the production and use of PFAS in a variety of jurisdictions, as discussed in Note 19, 'Commitments and Contingencies,' within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 3M has seen increased public and private lawsuits being filed on behalf of states, counties, cities, and utilities alleging, among other things, harm to the general public and damages to natural resources, some of which are pending in the AFFF multi-district litigation and some of which are pending in other jurisdictions. Various factors or developments in these and other disclosed actions could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on 3M. For example, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $897 million, inclusive of legal fees and other related obligations, in the first quarter of 2018 with respect to the settlement of a matter brought by the State of Minnesota involving the presence of PFAS in the groundwater, surface water, fish or other aquatic life, and sediments in the state. In addition, as described in greater detail in Note 19, 'Commitments and Contingencies,' within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in June 2023, the Company entered into a class-action settlement ('PWS Settlement') to resolve a wide range of drinking water claims by public water suppliers in the United States regarding PFAS. The court approved that settlement in March 2024. 3M will pay $10.5 billion to $12.5 billion in total to resolve the claims released by the PWS Settlement, with payments to be made from 2024 through 2036, in exchange for a release of certain claims, as described further in Note 19. Unexpected events related to the PWS Settlement, including the potential impact of the PWS Settlement on other PFAS-related matters, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or consolidated financial position. In addition, as previously disclosed, in connection with the separation of Solventum, the Company agreed to retain liabilities related to PFAS for certain products sold by the Company's health care businesses prior to the separation and by Solventum for a limited period of time following the separation.\n\nGovernmental inquiries, lawsuits, or laws and regulations involving PFAS could lead to the Company incurring liability for damages or other costs, civil or criminal proceedings, the imposition of fines and penalties, or other remedies, including orders to conduct remediation, as well as restrictions on or added costs for business operations going forward, including in the form of restrictions on discharges at manufacturing facilities, requiring the installation of control technologies, suspension or shutdown of facility operations, switching costs in seeking alternative sources of supply, potential customer damage claims due to supply disruptions or otherwise, restoration of and/or compensation for damages to natural resources, personal injury and property damages, and reporting requirements or bans on PFAS and PFAS-containing products manufactured by the Company. The Company may also record asset retirement obligations, some of which may be material, depending in part on how the Company manages related assets in connection with these activities. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or consolidated financial position.\n\n* The Company is subject to risks related to international, federal, state, and local treaties, laws, and regulations, as well as compliance risks related to legal or regulatory requirements, contract requirements, policies and practices, or other matters that require or encourage the Company or its suppliers, vendors, or channel partners to conduct business in a certain way. The outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings related to compliance with these treaties, laws, regulations, and requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Company's reputation, ability to execute its strategy and its results of operations.\n\nThe Company operates globally, including in some jurisdictions that pose potentially elevated risks of fraud or corruption or increased risk of internal control issues, and is subject to risks related to international, federal, state, and local treaties, laws, and regulations, including those involving product liability; securities and corporate governance; antitrust and competition; intellectual property; environmental, health, and safety; tax; the FCPA and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws; international import and export requirements and trade sanctions compliance; laws and regulations that apply to industries served by the Company, including the False Claims Act, anti-kickback laws, and the Sunshine Act; and other matters. The Company is also subject to compliance risks related to legal or regulatory requirements, contract requirements, policies and practices, or other matters that require or encourage the Company and its suppliers, vendors, or channel parties, to conduct business in a certain way. Legal compliance risks also include third-party risks where the Company's suppliers, vendors, or channel partners, or trade associations to which the Company belongs, have business practices that are inconsistent with 3M's Supplier Responsibility Code, 3M performance requirements, or with legal requirements.",

The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the fair value of plan assets.\n\nEquities consist primarily of mandates in public equity securities managed to various public equity indices. Publicly traded equities are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded.\n\nFixed Income investments include domestic and foreign government, and corporate debt securities. The debt securities are valued at the closing price reported if traded on an active market or at yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings or valued under a discounted cash flow approach that utilizes observable inputs, such as current yields of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks.\n\nPrivate equity funds consist of partnership interests in a variety of funds which are valued at NAV as described above. Real estate consists of property funds and REITS (Real Estate Investment Trusts). REITS are valued at NAV with published prices provided by the custodians.\n\nAbsolute return consists primarily of private partnership interests in hedge funds, insurance contracts and derivative instruments. Partnerships and hedge funds are valued at NAV as described above. Insurance consists of insurance contracts, which are valued using cash surrender values which is the amount the plan would receive if the contract was cashed out at year end. Derivative instruments consist of various swaps and bond futures that are used to help manage risks and are valued by the custodian using closing market swap curves and market derived input\n\nOther items to reconcile to fair value of plan assets include the net of interest receivables, amounts due for securities sold, amounts payable for securities purchased and interest payable.

These swaps converted $500 million and $300 million of 3M's $1 billion and $650 million principal amount of fix ed rate notes due 2049 and 2050, respectively, into floating rate debt for the portion of their terms through mid-2028 with an original interest rate based on a three-month LIBOR index, which since was amended to a rate based on a SOFR index.\n\nLong-Term Debt Maturities and Extinguishments: In 2024, 3M repaid $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes that matured.\n\nIn 2023, 3M repaid $500 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate registered notes that matured, $650 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate mediumterm notes that matured and 600 million euros aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate medium-term notes that matured.\n\nIn 2022, 3M repaid 500 million euros aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate medium-term notes that matured and $600 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate medium-term notes that matured.\n\nFloating Rate Notes: At various times, 3M has issued floating rate notes containing put provisions, amounting to $0.2 billion in total. 3M would be required to repurchase these securities at various prices ranging from 99 percent to 100 percent of par value according to the reduction schedules for each security. Under the terms of this floating rate note due in 2044, holders have an annual put feature at 100 percent of par value from 2014 and every anniversary thereafter until final maturity. Under the terms of the floating rate notes due in 2027, 2040 and 2041, holders have put options that commence ten years from the date of issuance and each third anniversary thereafter until final maturity at prices ranging from 99 percent to 100 percent of par value. For the periods presented, 3M was required to repurchase an immaterial amount of principal on the aforementioned floating rate notes.",

      "question": "How does Boeing's $2 unrealized gain on Level 3 corporate fixed income securities relate to its 'balanced index fund' pension investment approach, and how does this contrast with FedEx's 'liability-driven investment strategy' that emphasizes corporate fixed income securities?",
      "answer": "Boeing reported only a $2 unrealized gain on Level 3 corporate fixed income securities in 2023, which aligns with its pension plan's 'balanced index fund' approach that is comprised of approximately 60% equities and 40% debt securities. This suggests a more diversified, market-indexed strategy with limited active management in complex fixed income instruments like Level 3 corporate securities. In contrast, FedEx's pension plan explicitly follows a 'liability-driven investment strategy' that emphasizes corporate fixed income securities as a core asset class, benchmarked against indices like the Bloomberg Barclays Long Corporate, to better align plan assets with liabilities. FedEx's approach involves active management strategies aimed at outperforming market indices, which is different from Boeing's more passive, balanced approach that does not focus on aligning assets with specific liability durations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From Boeing's 10-K, identify the specific unrealized gain of $2 million on Level 3 corporate fixed income securities and note the 'balanced index fund' composition (60% equities, 40% debt).",
        "Step 2: From FedEx's 10-K, extract the mention of a 'liability-driven investment strategy' and the emphasis on corporate fixed income securities as a major asset class, benchmarked against specific indices.",
        "Step 3: Contrast Boeing's passive, diversified strategy with FedEx's active, liability-aligned approach, noting the different roles Level 3 corporate fixed income securities play in each."

      "answer": "Boeing provides spare parts through its Global Services segment as part of a full spectrum of aerospace products and services, which includes supply chain and logistics management. FedEx, which reports spare parts (principally aircraft-related) at weighted-average cost, provides allowances for obsolescence based on spare parts identified as excess or obsolete, as well as those expected to be on hand when aircraft are retired. Since FedEx relies on suppliers like Boeing for spare parts, Boeing's continued production and support of aircraft directly affect FedEx's inventory planning and spare parts lifecycle management. If Boeing discontinues or modifies aircraft models, FedEx may face increased obsolescence risk for parts obtained from Boeing, thereby increasing its allowances.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Boeing's Global Services segment provides spare parts and supply chain management services to commercial and defense customers.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Boeing's provision of spare parts affects FedEx's inventory planning and lifecycle management. If Boeing discontinues or modifies aircraft models, FedEx may face increased obsolescence risk for parts sourced from Boeing, leading to higher allowances."

      "answer": "Boeing's exposure to government-to-government relations is primarily through its commercial aircraft business, where trade policies, geopolitical stability, and international agreements significantly influence airline purchasing decisions and the financial health of its airline customers. For example, deterioration in global economic conditions or instability in customer financial stability could lead to order cancellations or delays, directly affecting Boeing\u2019s revenues, backlog, and cash flows. FedEx, on the other hand, is affected by government-to-government relations through global trade dynamics and airspace restrictions. Conflicts such as those between Russia and Ukraine or in the Middle East have led to airspace bans and route changes, which impact FedEx\u2019s global transportation volumes and operational flexibility. Additionally, shifts in international trade policies, such as tariffs, can reduce global freight volumes and negatively affect FedEx\u2019s business levels and yields.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Boeing's 10-K indicates that government-to-government relations influence airline demand for commercial aircraft, with economic and political stability affecting customer purchasing decisions and Boeing\u2019s backlog.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - FedEx's 10-K highlights that geopolitical conflicts and airspace restrictions, such as those related to Russia-Ukraine and Middle East tensions, impact global transportation volumes and operational efficiency.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are impacted by government-to-government relations, but the nature of the impact differs: Boeing through trade policy and airline financial health affecting aircraft orders, and FedEx through airspace access and global trade policy affecting freight volumes."

      "question": "How do geopolitical developments specifically impact both Boeing's supply chain operations and FedEx's transportation demand, and what is the combined effect on their respective financial positions?",
      "answer": "Geopolitical developments impact Boeing's supply chain by potentially causing service disruptions from suppliers, especially those located in unstable regions, which could lead to increased operating costs and delays in product delivery. Boeing depends on suppliers for raw materials like aluminum, titanium, and composites, and any disruption due to geopolitical issues could have a material adverse effect on its financial position. Similarly, geopolitical developments affect FedEx by reducing global trade volumes and shifting manufacturing closer to consumer markets, which leads to shorter shipping distances and lower yields. FedEx notes that geopolitical conflicts, such as those in Ukraine and the Middle East, have already negatively affected its results of operations. The combined effect is that both companies face financial risks: Boeing from supply chain instability and FedEx from reduced transportation demand and shifting service preferences.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Boeing relies on suppliers for raw materials like aluminum, titanium, and composites, and geopolitical developments could disrupt this supply chain, leading to increased operating costs and production delays.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - FedEx experiences reduced demand for transportation services due to geopolitical developments, including shifts in manufacturing closer to consumers and reduced global trade volumes, which has already negatively affected its results of operations.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both Boeing and FedEx are negatively impacted by geopolitical developments, but through different mechanisms: Boeing through supply chain disruptions and FedEx through reduced transportation demand. These impacts influence their respective financial positions by increasing costs and reducing revenue potential."

      "answer": "FDX offers a Supply Chain Finance (SCF) program where suppliers can sell their invoices to financial institutions for early discounted payments. As of May 31, 2024, suppliers have been approved to sell $94 million of FDX's outstanding payment obligations under this program. FDX guarantees payments to the financial institutions and includes the amounts due to suppliers in accounts payable on its consolidated balance sheets. In contrast, GE evaluates its SCF programs to ensure that the involvement of third-party intermediaries in settling trade payables does not alter the nature, existence, amount, or timing of those payables or provide GE with any direct economic benefit. If any of these conditions were to change or if GE were to receive a direct economic benefit, it would reclassify the trade payables as borrowings. This indicates that GE maintains stricter controls over the classification of its obligations under SCF arrangements compared to FDX, which treats the obligations as accounts payable without reclassification.",

        "Step 1: Extract from FDX's filing - FDX's SCF program allows suppliers to sell invoices to financial institutions for early payment, with $94 million approved for outstanding obligations as of May 31, 2024.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - FDX treats SCF-related obligations as standard accounts payable, while GE explicitly states conditions under which such obligations would be reclassified as borrowings, indicating a more cautious accounting approach."

          "chunk_text": "## FEDEX CORPORATION\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nFor real estate leases, we account for lease components and non-lease components (such as common area maintenance) as a single lease component. Certain real estate leases require additional payments based on sales volume and index-based rate increases, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance, and insurance, which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs. Certain leases contain fixed lease payments for items such as real estate taxes, common area maintenance, and insurance. These fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use asset and lease liability. See Note 7 for additional information.\n\nDERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting, and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. We may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of our risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or we elect not to apply hedge accounting. We are not subject to any master netting agreements.\n\nSUPPLIER FINANCE PROGRAM. We offer voluntary Supply Chain Finance ('SCF') programs through financial institutions to certain of our suppliers. We agree to commercial terms with our suppliers, including prices, quantities, and payment terms, and they issue invoices to us based on the agreed-upon contractual terms. If our suppliers choose to participate in the SCF programs, they determine which invoices, if any, to sell to the financial institutions to receive an early discounted payment, while we settle the invoice amount with the financial institutions on the payment due dates. We guarantee these payments with the financial institutions.\n\nAmounts due to our suppliers that participate in the SCF programs are included in accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets. We have been informed by the participating financial institutions that as of May 31, 2024 and May 31, 2023, suppliers have been approved to sell to them $94 million and $83 million, respectively, of our outstanding payment obligations. A rollforward of obligations confirmed and paid during the year is presented below (in millions):\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "INSURANCE. Our run-off insurance operations include providing insurance and reinsurance for life and health risks and providing certain annuity products. Primary product types include long-term care, structured settlement annuities, life and disability insurance contracts and investment contracts. Insurance contracts are contracts with significant mortality and/or morbidity risks, while investment contracts are contracts without such risks. Insurance revenue is comprised primarily of premiums and investment income. For traditional long-duration insurance contracts, we report premiums as revenue when due. Premiums received on non-traditional long-duration insurance contracts and investment contracts, including annuities without significant mortality risk, are not reported as revenue but rather as deposit liabilities. We recognize revenue for charges and assessments on these contracts, mostly for mortality, administration and surrender. Interest credited to policyholder accounts is charged to expense.\n\nFuture policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums. The liability is measured for each group of contracts (i.e., cohorts) using current cash flow assumptions. A s a run-off insurance operation consisting substantially all of reinsurance, contracts are grouped into cohorts by legal entity and product type, based on the date the reinsurance contract was consummated. Future policy benefit reserves are adjusted each period as a result of updating lifetime net premium ratios for differences between actual and expected experience with the retroactive effect of those variances recognized in current period earnings. We review at least annually in the third quarter, future policy benefit reserves cash flow assumptions, except related claim expenses which remain locked-in, and if the review concludes that the assumptions need to be updated, future policy benefit reserves are adjusted retroactively based on the revised net premium ratio using actual historical experience, updated cash flow assumptions, and the locked-in discount rate with the effect of those changes recognized in current period earnings.\n\nAs our insurance operations are in run-off, the locked-in discount rate is used for the computation of interest accretion on future policy benefit reserves recognized in earnings. However, cash flows used to estimate future policy benefit reserves are also discounted using an upper-medium grade (i.e., low credit risk) fixedincome instrument yield reflecting the duration characteristics of the liabilities and is updated each reporting period with changes recorded in A ccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI). As a result, changes in the current discount rate at each reporting period are recognized as an adjustment to A OCI and not earnings each period, whereas, changes relating to cash flow assumptions are recognized in the Statement of Earnings (Loss).\n\nLiabilities for inv estment contracts equal the account value, that is, the amount that accrues to the benefit of the contract or policyholder including credited interest and assessments through the financial statement date. See Note 12 for further information.\n\nPOSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. We sponsor a number of pension and retiree health and life insurance benefit plans that we present in three categories, principal pension plans, other pension plans and principal retiree benefit plans. We use a December 31 measurement date for these plans. On our Statement of Financial Position, we measure our plan assets at fair value and the obligations at the present value of the estimated payments to plan participants. Participants earn benefits based on their service and pay. Those estimated future payment amounts are determined based on assumptions. Differences between our actual results and what we assumed are recorded in a separate component of equity each period. These differences are amortized into earnings over the remaining average future service of active employees or the expected life of inactive participants, as applicable, who participate in the plan. See Note 13 for further information.\n\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES. Loss contingencies are existing conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when future events occur or fail to occur. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to environmental obligations, litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability  in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. When there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. Disclosure is provided for material loss contingencies when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We regularly review contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. See Note 24 for further information.\n\nSUPPLY CHAIN FINANCE PROG RAMS. We evaluate supply chain finance programs to ensure where we use a third-party intermediary to settle our trade payables, their inv olv ement does not change the nature, existence, amount or timing of our trade payables and does not provide the Company with any direct economic benefit. If any  characteristics of the trade pay ables change or we receive a direct economic benefit, we reclassify the trade payables as borrowings.\n\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. The following sections describe the valuation methodologies we use to measure financial and non-financial instruments accounted for at fair value including certain assets within our pension plans and retiree benefit plans. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions. These inputs establish a fair value hierarchy: Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable; and Level 3 Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable.\n\n46 2024 FORM  10-K",

          "chunk_text": "distributed throughout the world, there are concentrations of key assets within our networks that are exposed to adverse weather conditions or localized risks from natural or manmade disasters such as earthquakes, volcanoes, wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, severe winter weather, heat waves, extended droughts, conflicts or unrest, terrorist attacks, or other disturbances, actual or threatened. Additionally, shifts in weather patterns caused by climate change could increase the frequency, severity, or duration of certain adverse weather conditions. We may experience reduced availability and/or increases in the cost of insurance due to such changes. Prolonged interruptions or disruptions at a key location such as our FedEx Memphis World Hub or one of our information-technology centers could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We also may incur significant costs to reestablish or relocate these functions. Moreover, resulting economic dislocations, including supply chain and fuel disruptions, could adversely affect demand for our services resulting in an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\n## Other Legal, Regulatory, and Miscellaneous Risks\n\nGovernment regulation and enforcement are evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business. We are subject to regulation under a wide variety of U.S. federal, state, and local and non-U.S. government regulations, laws, policies, and actions. There can be no assurance that such regulations, laws, policies, and actions will not be changed in ways that will decrease the demand for our services, subject us to escalating costs, or require us to modify our business models and objectives (such as our DRIVE transformation program, including Network 2.0), harming our financial results. In particular, legislative, regulatory, or other actions that U.S. and non-U.S. governments have undertaken or could take in areas such as data privacy and sovereignty, the use of artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies, taxes, foreign ex change intervention in response to currency volatility, currency controls that could restrict the movement of liquidity from particular jurisdictions, trade controls, tariffs, quotas, embargoes, or sanctions in the U.S. or other countries, complex  economic sanctions, import and ex port controls, customs standards, additional security or workplace and transportation health and safety requirements, labor and employment standards (including with respect to our pilots), worker classification, joint employment and benefits, government contracting, antitrust, regulated commodities, environmental, climate-related, or emission standards, and accounting may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, effective tax rate, and service levels. Furthermore, some of our operations are in high-risk legal compliance environments, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the 'FCPA'), similar anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions, and other compliance-related laws or regulations could result in litigation, assessment of damages, imposition of penalties, or other consequences. For additional discussion, see 'Item 1. Business' of this Annual Report under the caption 'Regulation.' Additionally, in light of the recently held and upcoming elections in the U.S. and various international jurisdictions, there is considerable uncertainty regarding reforms of various aspects of ex isting laws, regulations, and enforcement priorities and strategies that could affect trade policies, labor matters, tax es, and technological advancements, among other areas, and have a material effect on our business and results of operations, as well as on the price of our common stock.\n\nWe could be subject to adverse changes in regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions. We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, changes in tax  laws or regulations may be enacted that could significantly affect our overall tax  liabilities and our effective tax rate. U.S. and foreign governmental agencies maintain focus on the taxation of multinational companies, including statutory tax rates, digital tax es, global minimum taxes (such as the framework agreed to by members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development), and transactions between affiliated companies. Such changes may require new and complex computations to be performed, significant judgments, estimates, and calculations to be made, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced.\n\nStandard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of certain tax laws and regulations will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation, and we may be required to make adjustments to amounts that we have recorded that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. See 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition-Results of Operations and Outlook -Consolidated Results-Income Taxes' of this Annual Report for additional information regarding ongoing tax examinations and challenges. Additionally, see 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition-Critical Accounting Estimates-Income Taxes' of this Annual Report for information regarding estimates and potential adjustments related to our tax positions.\n\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding data protection. There has recently been heightened regulatory and enforcement focus relating to the collection, use, retention, transfer, and processing of personal data in the U.S. (at both the state and federal level) and internationally, including the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, the California Privacy Rights Act, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, and other similar laws that have been or will be enacted by other jurisdictions. In addition, in the U.S. and internationally, there has been increased legislative and regulatory activity related to artificial intelligence and the risks and challenges artificial intelligence poses, including the European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act and the current U.S. presidential administration's ex ecutive order to, among other things, establish artificial intelligence safety and security. Also, China and certain other jurisdictions have enacted more stringent data localization requirements. An actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable U.S. or foreign data protection laws, regulations, or other data protection standards may expose us to litigation (including, in some instances, class action litigation), fines, sanctions, or other penalties, which",

In addition, changes in environmental and climate change laws, regulations or policies (including emissions pricing and taxes, emissions standards or sustainable finance, among others) affecting the aerospace and defense sector could lead to additional costs or compliance requirements, a need for additional investment in product designs, require carbon offset investments or otherwise negatively impact our business or competitive position. Other legislative and regulatory areas of significance for our business that U.S. and non-U.S. governments have focused and continue to focus on include cybersecurity, data privacy and sovereignty, artificial intelligence, anti-corruption, competition law, public procurement law, compliance with complex trade controls and economic sanctions laws, technical regulations or local content requirements that could result in market access criteria that our products cannot or do not meet, restrictions related to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFA S), foreign exchange intervention in response to currency volatility and currency controls that could restrict the movement of liquidity  from particular jurisdictions. Potential changes to tax  laws, including changes to taxation of global income, may have an effect on our subsidiaries' structure, operations, sales, liquidity, cash flows, capital requirements, effective tax rate and performance. For example, legislative or regulatory measures by U.S. federal, state or non-U.S. governments, or rules, interpretations or audits under new or existing tax laws such as global minimum taxes or other changes to the treatment of global income, could increase our cash tax costs and effective tax rate. Regulation or government scrutiny may impact the requirements for marketing our products and slow our ability to introduce new products, resulting in an adverse impact on our business. Furthermore, we make sales to U.S. and non-U.S. governments and other public sector customers, and we participate in various governmental financing programs, that require us to comply with strict governmental regulations. As a U.S. government contractor, we are also subject to risks relating to U.S. government audits and investigations that in the past have led, and in the future may lead, to cash withholds, fines, damages or other penalties under civil or criminal laws. Inability to comply with applicable regulations could adversely affect our status with government customers or our ability to participate in projects and could have collateral consequences such as suspension or debarment. Suspension or debarment, depending on the entity involved and length of time, can limit our ability to bid for new U.S. government contracts or business with other government-related customers, and this could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nLegal proceedings - We are subject to a variety of legal proceedings, disputes, investigations and legal compliance risks, including contingent liabilities from businesses that we have exited or are inactive. We are subject to a variety of legal proceedings, commercial disputes, legal compliance risks and environmental, health and safety compliance risks in virtually every part of the world. We, our representatives and our industry are subject to continuing scrutiny by regulators, other governmental authorities and private sector entities or individuals in the U.S., the European Union and other jurisdictions, which have led or may, in certain circumstances, lead to enforcement actions, adverse changes to our business practices, fines and penalties, required remedial actions such as contaminated site clean-up or other environmental claims, or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages that could be material. For example, we remain subject to shareholder lawsuits related to the Company's financial performance, accounting and disclosure practices and related legacy matters from several years ago. These types of proceedings involving claims about past financial performance and reporting, as well as any future claims that may arise about past or current misconduct, even if unfounded, may have a significant impact on our reputation and how we are viewed by investors, customers and others. We also from time to time are involved in commercial discussions, disputes or proceedings in which, given the nature of our business that often involves large equipment and service orders and long-term commercial relationships, the claims asserted can be for significant amounts. The estimation of legal reserves or possible losses involves significant judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes inherent in litigation, disputes and investigations, and the actual losses arising from particular matters may exceed our current estimates and adversely affect our financial results. The risk management and compliance programs we have adopted and related actions that we take may not fully mitigate legal and compliance risks that we face, particularly in light of the global and div erse nature of our operations and the current enforcement environments in many jurisdictions. For example, when we investigate potential noncompliance under U.S. and non-U.S. law involving our employees, partners or third parties we work with, in some circumstances we make self-disclosures about our findings to the relevant authorities who may pursue or decline to pursue enforcement proceedings against us in connection with those matters. We are also subject to material trailing legal liabilities from businesses that we have exited or are inactive. We also expect that additional legal proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time. M oreover, we sell products and services in growth markets where claims arising from alleged violations of law, product failures or other incidents involving our products and services are adjudicated within legal systems that are less developed and less reliable than those of the U.S. or other more developed markets, and this can create additional uncertainty about the outcome of proceedings before courts or other governmental bodies in those markets. See Note 24 for further information about legal proceedings and other loss contingencies.\n\nLEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

      "question": "How do the differences in scale and structure of the Supply Chain Finance programs between FDX and GE reflect contrasting financial strategies in managing supplier liquidity, and what does this suggest about their respective supply chain dependencies?",
      "answer": "FDX's Supply Chain Finance (SCF) program had $94 million in approved supplier obligations as of May 31, 2024, indicating a relatively modest level of supplier financing activity where FDX guarantees payments to financial institutions upon invoice sale by suppliers. In contrast, GE reported $494 million in collected receivables from customer-sponsored SCF programs in 2024, showing a significantly larger volume of SCF participation, primarily in its Commercial Engines & Services business, where GE transfers receivables with no continuing involvement and receives cash at invoice value. The difference in scale suggests that GE is more deeply integrated into SCF mechanisms as a tool for facilitating sales and managing customer relationships, particularly in long-term engine programs with partners. FDX, on the other hand, uses SCF more selectively to support supplier liquidity without the same level of embeddedness in ongoing program financing. This contrast implies that GE's supply chain is more financially interdependent with its partners, while FDX maintains a more arms-length financial relationship with its suppliers.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from FDX's 10-K that suppliers were approved to sell $94 million of FDX's obligations under the SCF program as of May 31, 2024.",
        "Step 2: Extract from GE's 10-K that the company collected $494 million in receivables from customer-sponsored SCF programs in 2024, primarily in Commercial Engines & Services, with no continuing involvement after invoice transfer.",
        "Step 3: Compare the scale and operational role of SCF programs between the two companies \u2014 FDX\u2019s program is smaller and involves payment guarantees, while GE\u2019s is larger and embedded in long-term engine programs with revenue-sharing partners.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize how these differences reflect contrasting financial strategies \u2014 FDX uses SCF to support supplier liquidity selectively, whereas GE integrates SCF into broader sales and partnership financing."

Certain real estate leases require additional payments based on sales volume and index-based rate increases, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance, and insurance, which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs. Certain leases contain fixed lease payments for items such as real estate taxes, common area maintenance, and insurance. These fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use asset and lease liability. See Note 7 for additional information.\n\nDERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting, and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. We may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of our risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or we elect not to apply hedge accounting. We are not subject to any master netting agreements.\n\nSUPPLIER FINANCE PROGRAM. We offer voluntary Supply Chain Finance ('SCF') programs through financial institutions to certain of our suppliers. We agree to commercial terms with our suppliers, including prices, quantities, and payment terms, and they issue invoices to us based on the agreed-upon contractual terms. If our suppliers choose to participate in the SCF programs, they determine which invoices, if any, to sell to the financial institutions to receive an early discounted payment, while we settle the invoice amount with the financial institutions on the payment due dates. We guarantee these payments with the financial institutions.\n\nAmounts due to our suppliers that participate in the SCF programs are included in accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets. We have been informed by the participating financial institutions that as of May 31, 2024 and May 31, 2023, suppliers have been approved to sell to them $94 million and $83 million, respectively, of our outstanding payment obligations.

To test the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. pension plans, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the methodologies used, the significant actuarial assumptions described above, and the underlying data used by the Company. Wecompared the actuarial assumptions used by management to historical trends and evaluated the change in the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. pension plans fromthe prior year due to the change in service cost, interest cost, actuarial gains, and benefit payments. In addition, we involved our actuarial specialists to assist in evaluating management's methodology for determining the discount rate. As part of this assessment, we compared management's selected discount rate to an independently developed range of reasonable discount rates. Additionally, we compared the projected future cash flows of the U.S. pension plans to the prior year projections and compared the current year benefits paid to the prior year projected cash flows.

These accrued liabilities are primarily based on the actuarially estimated cost of claims, including incurred-but-not-reported (IBNR) claims.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit   | Weobtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over management's process for estimating self-insurance accruals, including management's review of the significant assumptions used, results of calculations and assessment of data underlying the accruals. To evaluate the self-insurance accruals, our audit procedures included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying claims data used by the Company. Weinvolved our actuarial specialists to assist in our evaluation of the methodologies applied by management in establishing the actuarially determined accrual and in reviewing the Company's reinsurance contracts by policy year to assess the Company's self-insured retentions, deductibles, and coverage limits. Wecompared the Company's accrued amounts to a range developed by our actuarial specialists. Furthermore, we compared the Company's historical estimates of expected incurred losses to actual losses experienced during the current year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",

Fair value adjustments, including impairments, recorded in earnings were $159 million and $70 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and insignificant for December 31, 2022. These are primarily limited partnership investments in private equity, infrastructure and real estate funds that are measured at net asset value per share (or equivalent) as a practical expedient to estimated fair value and are excluded from the fair value hierarchy. These limited partnership investments are generally not eligible for redemption and generally cannot be sold without approval of the general partner. Distribution from each fund will be received as the underlying investments of the funds are liquidated at the discretion of the general partner. These investments are generally considered illiquid and our ability to receive the most recent net asset value in a sale would be determined by external market factors.\n\nOur run-off insurance operations have approximately $700 million of assets held by states or other regulatory bodies in statutorily required deposit accounts, and approximately $29,800 million of assets held in trust accounts associated with reinsurance contracts and reinsurance security trust agreements in place between either Employers Reassurance Corporation (ERAC) or Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC) as the reinsuring entity and a number of ceding insurers. Assets in these trusts are held by an independent trustee for the benefit of the ceding insurer, and are subject to various investment guidelines as set forth in the respective reinsurance contracts and trust agreements. Some of these trust agreements may allow a ceding company to withdraw trust assets from the trust and hold these assets on its balance sheet, in an account under its control for the benefit of ERA C or UFLIC which might allow the ceding company to exercise investment control over such assets.",

      "answer": "GE structures its Performance Stock Unit Grants under the General Electric Company 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan with specific forms of agreements referenced in filings, indicating a formalized and plan-specific approach to executive compensation tied to long-term incentives. In contrast, UNP explicitly ties its Performance Stock Units to measurable performance criteria such as annual return on invested capital (ROIC) and operating income growth (OIG), benchmarked against companies in the S&P 100 Industrials Index and Class I railroads, with two-thirds of the fair value of units tied to forecasted ROIC and one-third to relative OIG performance. This shows that UNP emphasizes quantifiable financial metrics and external benchmarking in its incentive alignment, while GE's approach appears more procedural and less explicitly tied to external performance benchmarks.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - GE uses formal agreements for Performance Stock Unit Grants under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan, indicating a structured procedural approach.",

      "answer": "The use of the December 31 measurement date ensures consistency in financial reporting for both GE and UNP by aligning the valuation of pension plan assets and obligations to a common point in time. GE measures its plan assets at fair value and obligations at the present value of estimated payments to participants as of December 31, incorporating assumptions about future payments and service. UNP similarly uses December 31 to measure both plan assets and obligations, with its PBO (Projected Benefit Obligation) reflecting the present value of benefits earned to date, including assumed future compensation increases. This shared measurement date allows both companies to capture the funded status of their plans accurately at year-end, though differences in assumptions and methodologies (e.g., GE\u2019s equity amortization approach vs. UNP\u2019s PBO calculation) may still affect the precision and comparability of their reported liabilities and pension costs.",

UNP, on the other hand, incorporates its cybersecurity incident response into its Crisis Management Plan and conducted a tabletop exercise in 2023 specifically involving the Board of Directors and certain management employees. While both companies emphasize structured incident response and cross-functional involvement, GE's approach includes broader enterprise and business-level simulations, whereas UNP focused on executive-level engagement through a specific 2023 tabletop exercise.",

      "answer": "Boeing faces potential uninsured liabilities from international use of its products like aircraft technologies and missile systems, as the SAFETY Act only shields them domestically. This lack of international protection could lead to significant liabilities that Boeing may have to bear directly. In contrast, Lockheed Martin relies on various indemnifications, including SAFETY Act protections, and seeks insurance coverage for its advanced defense systems, but acknowledges that coverage may not be sufficient or available for all risks. The financial implication for Boeing is the potential for substantial uncovered costs, while Lockheed Martin faces uncertainty in coverage renewals and exposure to hazardous risks that insurance may not fully protect against.",

For  example,  liabilities  arising  from  the  use  of  certain  of  our  products,  such  as  aircraft technologies, space systems, spacecraft, satellites, missile systems, weapons, cybersecurity, border security systems, anti-terrorism technologies and/or air traffic management systems may not be insurable on commercially reasonable terms. While some of these products are shielded from liability within the U.S. under the SAFETY Act provisions of the 2002  Homeland  Security  Act,  no  such  protection  is  available  outside  the  U.S.,  potentially  resulting  in  significant liabilities.  The  amount  of  insurance  coverage  we  maintain  may  be  inadequate  to  cover  these  or  other  claims  or liabilities.\n\n## A  significant  portion  of  our  customer  financing  portfolio  is  concentrated  among  certain  customers  and  in certain types of Boeing aircraft, which exposes us to concentration risks.\n\nA  significant  portion  of  our  customer  financing  portfolio  is  concentrated  among  certain  customers  and  in  distinct geographic regions. Our portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft, and among customers that we believe have less than investment-grade credit. If one or more  customers  holding  a  significant  portion  of  our  portfolio  assets  experiences  financial  difficulties  or  otherwise defaults  on  or  does  not  renew  its  leases  with  us  at  their  expiration,  and  we  are  unable  to  redeploy  the  aircraft  on reasonable terms, or if the types of aircraft that are concentrated in our portfolio suffer greater than expected declines in value, our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Risks Related to Labor\n\nSome  of  our  and  our  suppliers'  workforces  are  represented  by  labor  unions,  which  may  lead  to  work stoppages.\n\nApproximately  47,000  employees,  which  constitute  33%  of  our  total  workforce,  were  union  represented  as  of December 31, 2021. We experienced a work stoppage in 2008 when a labor strike halted commercial aircraft  and certain BDS program production. We may experience additional work stoppages in the future, which could adversely affect our business. We cannot predict how stable our relationships, currently with 11 U.S. labor organizations and 12 non-U.S. labor organizations, will be or whether we will be able to meet the unions' requirements without impacting our financial condition. The unions may also limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. Union actions at suppliers can also affect us. Work stoppages and instability in our union relationships could delay the production and/or development of our products, which could strain relationships with customers and cause a loss of revenues which would adversely affect our operations.\n\n## Item 1B.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Our estimates and projections may prove to be inaccurate and certain of our assets may be at risk of future impairment.\n\nThe accounting for some of our most significant activities is based on judgments and estimates, which are complex and subject to many variables. For example, accounting for sales using the percentage-of-completion method requires that we assess risks and make assumptions regarding future schedule, cost, technical and performance issues for thousands of contracts, many of which are long-term in nature. Additionally, we initially allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses based on a preliminary assessment of  the  fair  value  of  identifiable  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed.  For  significant  acquisitions  we  may  use  a  one-year measurement period to analyze and assess a number of factors used in establishing  the  asset  and  liability  fair  values  as  of  the acquisition date which could result in adjustments to asset and liability balances.\n\nWe have $10.8 billion of goodwill assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 from previous acquisitions,  which  represents  approximately  21%  of  our  total  assets.  These  goodwill  assets  are  subject  to  annual  impairment testing  and  more  frequent  testing  upon  the  occurrence  of  certain  events  or  significant  changes  in  circumstances  that  indicate goodwill may be impaired. If we experience changes or factors arise that negatively affect the expected cash flows of a reporting unit, we may be required to write off all or a portion of the reporting unit's related goodwill assets. The carrying value and fair value  of  our  Sikorsky  reporting  unit  are  closely  aligned.  Therefore,  any  business  deterioration,  contract  cancellations  or terminations, or market pressures could cause our sales, earnings and cash flows to decline below current projections and could cause  goodwill  and  intangible  assets  to  be  impaired.  Additionally,  Sikorsky  may  not  perform  as  expected,  or  demand  for  its products may be adversely affected by global economic conditions, including oil and gas trends that are outside of our control.\n\nActual financial results could differ from our judgments and estimates. See 'Critical Accounting Policies' in the MD&amp;A and Results  of  Operations  and  'Note  1  -  Organization  and  Significant Accounting  Policies'  included  in  our  Notes  to  Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies and use of estimates.\n\n## Changes in tax laws and regulations or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial results.\n\nChanges in U.S. (federal or state) or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including those with retroactive effect, could result in increases in our tax expense and affect profitability and cash flows. For example, beginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures immediately in the  year  incurred  and  requires  taxpayers  to  amortize  such  expenditures  over  five  years.  If  these  provisions  are  not  deferred, modified, or repealed by Congress with retroactive effect to January 1, 2022, they will materially decrease our cash from operations beginning  in  2022.  We  currently  estimate  an  approximately  $500  million  impact  to  2022  cash  from  operations  based  on  the provisions currently in effect. The actual impact on 2022 cash from operations will depend on if and when these provisions are deferred, modified, or repealed by Congress, including if retroactively, and the amount of research and development expenses paid or incurred in 2022 among other factors. In addition, recent proposals to increase the U.S. corporate income tax rate would require us to increase our net deferred tax assets upon enactment of new tax legislation, with a corresponding material, one-time, noncash decrease in  income tax expense, but our income tax expense and payments would likely be materially increased in subsequent years. See \"Consolidated Results of Operations - Income Tax Expense\" in the MD&amp;A for additional detail on the potential effect of tax rate increases. In addition to future changes in tax laws, the amount of net deferred tax assets will change periodically based on several  factors,  including  the  measurement  of  our  postretirement  benefit  plan  obligations,  actual  cash  contributions  to  our postretirement  benefit  plans,  and  future  changes  in  tax  laws.  In  addition,  we  are  regularly  under  audit  or  examination  by  tax authorities, including foreign tax authorities. The final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could similarly result in unanticipated increases in our tax expense and affect profitability and cash flows.\n\n## Our business involves significant risks and uncertainties that may not be covered by indemnity or insurance.\n\nA significant  portion  of  our  business  relates  to  designing,  developing  and  manufacturing  advanced  defense  and  technology products and systems. New technologies may be untested or unproven. Failure of some of these products and services could result in extensive loss of life or property damage. Accordingly, we may incur liabilities that are unique to our products and services. In some but not  all  circumstances,  we  may  be  entitled  to  certain  legal  protections  or  indemnifications  from  our  customers,  either through U.S. Government indemnifications under Public Law 85-804, 10 U.S.C. 2354, the Commercial Space Launch Act or the Price-Anderson Act, qualification of our products and services by the Department of Homeland Security under the SAFETY Act provisions of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, contractual provisions or otherwise. We seek to obtain insurance coverage from established and reputable insurance carriers to cover these risks and liabilities. The amount of insurance coverage that we maintain may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities. Insurance coverage is subject to the terms and conditions of the insurance contract and is further subject to any sublimits, exclusions, restrictions, or defenses. Existing coverage is renewed annually and may be canceled while we remain exposed to the risk and it is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all operational risks, natural hazards and liabilities. For example, we are limited in the amount of insurance we can obtain to cover unusually hazardous risks or certain natural hazards such as earthquakes, fires or extreme",

The $168 million reach-forward loss in the first quarter of 2020 on VC-25B was associated with engineering inefficiencies from the COVID-19 environment.\n\nBDS  earnings  from  operations  in  2020  decreased  by  $1,076  million  compared  with  2019  primarily  due  to  the unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $828 million higher than the prior year, largely due to higher charges in 2020 of $1,320 million on KC-46A Tanker and $168 million on VC-25B, offset by $489 million in charges on Commercial Crew in 2019. The lower earnings in 2020 also reflect lower gains on property sales compared to the same period in 2019. These current period decreases were partially offset by the volume increases described above.\n\nBDS earnings from operations includes our share of income or loss from equity method investments of $53 million, $141 million and $128 million primarily from our ULA and non-U.S. joint ventures in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## Backlog\n\nTotal backlog of $59,828 million at December 31, 2021 was $1,019 million lower than December 31, 2020 due to the timing of awards and revenue recognized.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\nOur BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense, Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.\n\nSome of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis, and BDS customers are increasingly seeking fixed-price proposals for new programs. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include Commercial Crew,  KC-46A  Tanker,  MQ-25,  T-7A  Red  Hawk,  VC-25B,  and  commercial  and  military  satellites.  A  number  of  our ongoing fixed-price development programs have reach-forward losses. New programs could also have risk for reachforward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. Many development programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which  could  result  in  a  material  charge  or  otherwise  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition.  These  programs  are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery  dates  could  be  extended,  which  could  trigger  termination  provisions,  the  loss  of  satellite  in-orbit incentive payments or other financially significant exposure. Risk remains that we may be required to record additional reach-forward losses in future periods.",

The $168 million reach-forward loss in the first quarter of 2020 on VC-25B was associated with engineering inefficiencies from the COVID-19 environment.\n\nBDS  earnings  from  operations  in  2020  decreased  by  $1,076  million  compared  with  2019  primarily  due  to  the unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $828 million higher than the prior year, largely due to higher charges in 2020 of $1,320 million on KC-46A Tanker and $168 million on VC-25B, offset by $489 million in charges on Commercial Crew in 2019. The lower earnings in 2020 also reflect lower gains on property sales compared to the same period in 2019. These current period decreases were partially offset by the volume increases described above.\n\nBDS earnings from operations includes our share of income or loss from equity method investments of $53 million, $141 million and $128 million primarily from our ULA and non-U.S. joint ventures in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## Backlog\n\nTotal backlog of $59,828 million at December 31, 2021 was $1,019 million lower than December 31, 2020 due to the timing of awards and revenue recognized.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\nOur BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense, Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.\n\nSome of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis, and BDS customers are increasingly seeking fixed-price proposals for new programs. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include Commercial Crew,  KC-46A  Tanker,  MQ-25,  T-7A  Red  Hawk,  VC-25B,  and  commercial  and  military  satellites.  A  number  of  our ongoing fixed-price development programs have reach-forward losses. New programs could also have risk for reachforward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. Many development programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which  could  result  in  a  material  charge  or  otherwise  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition.  These  programs  are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery  dates  could  be  extended,  which  could  trigger  termination  provisions,  the  loss  of  satellite  in-orbit incentive payments or other financially significant exposure. Risk remains that we may be required to record additional reach-forward losses in future periods.",

If U.S. government policy shifts result in contract terminations, both companies could face financial strain\u2014Boeing could lose reimbursement for incomplete work beyond allowable termination costs, while Lockheed Martin could face unilateral definitization of contracts or penalties under offset agreements.

We aspire to achieve zero workplace injuries and provide a safe, open and accountable work environment for our employees. We provide several channels for all employees to speak up, ask for guidance and report concerns related to ethics or safety violations. We address employee concerns and take appropriate actions that uphold our Boeing values.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe  commercial  jet  aircraft  market  and  the  airline  industry  remain  extremely  competitive.  We  face  aggressive international  competitors  who  are  intent  on  increasing  their  market  share,  such  as  Airbus  and  other  entrants  from Russia, China and Japan. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts. We intend to continue to compete with other airplane manufacturers by providing customers with higher quality products.\n\nBDS faces strong competition in all market segments, primarily from Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Raytheon Technologies Corporation, General Dynamics Corporation and SpaceX. Non-U.S. companies such as BAE Systems and Airbus Group continue to build a strategic presence in the U.S. market by strengthening their  North American  operations  and  partnering  with  U.S.  defense  companies.  In  addition,  certain  competitors  have occasionally formed teams with other competitors to address specific customer requirements. BDS expects the trend of strong competition to continue into 2022.\n\nThe commercial and defense services markets are extremely challenging and are made up of many of the same strong U.S. and non-U.S. competitors facing BCA and BDS along with other competitors in those markets. BGS leverages our extensive services network offering products and services which span the life cycle of our defense and commercial airplane programs: training, fleet services and logistics, maintenance and engineering, modifications and upgrades, as well as the daily cycle of gate-to-gate operations. BGS expects the market to remain highly competitive in 2022, and intends to grow market share by leveraging a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity.\n\n## Regulatory Matters\n\nOur businesses are heavily regulated in most of our markets. We work with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including but not limited to, all of the branches of the U.S. military, NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exist in our non-U.S. markets.\n\nGovernment Contracts. The U.S. government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience, as well as for default based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. If any of our  U.S.  government  contracts  were  to  be  terminated  for  convenience,  we  generally  would  be  entitled  to  receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the U.S. government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and could require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. The U.S. government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default.\n\nCommercial  Aircraft. In  the  U.S.,  our  commercial  aircraft  products  are  required  to  comply  with  FAA  regulations governing production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. New aircraft models and new derivative aircraft are required to obtain FAA certification prior to entry into  service.  Outside  the  U.S.,  similar  requirements  exist  for  airworthiness,  installation  and  operational  approvals. These requirements are generally",

International competitions also may be subject to different laws or contracting practices of international governments that may affect how we structure our bid for the procurement. In many international procurements, the purchasing government's relationship with the U.S. and its industrial cooperation programs are important factors in determining the outcome of a competition. It is common for international customers to require contractors to  comply with their industrial  cooperation  regulations,  sometimes  referred  to  as  offset  requirements,  and  we  have  entered  into foreign offset agreements as part of securing some international business. For more information concerning offset agreements, see 'Contractual Commitments' in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 1A - Risk Factors.\n\n## Government Contracts and Regulations\n\nOur business is heavily regulated. We contract with numerous U.S. Government agencies and entities, principally all branches of the U.S. military and NASA. We also contract with similar government authorities in other countries and they regulate our nonFMS  international  sales.  Additionally,  our  commercial  aircraft  products  are  required  to  comply  with  U.S.  and  international regulations governing production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety.\n\nWe must comply with, and are affected by, laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S.  Government  and  other  governments'  contracts,  including  foreign  governments.  These  laws  and  regulations,  among  other things:\n\n- require certification and disclosure of all cost or pricing data in connection with certain types of contract negotiations;\n- impose  specific  and  unique  cost  accounting  practices  that  may  differ  from  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles (GAAP);\n- impose acquisition regulations, which may change or be replaced over time, that define which costs can be charged to the U.S. Government,  how  and  when  costs  can  be  charged,  and  otherwise  govern  our  right  to  reimbursement  under  certain  U.S. Government and foreign contracts;\n- require  specific  security  controls  to  protect  U.S.  Government  controlled  unclassified  information  and  restrict  the  use  and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the export of certain products, services and technical data; and compliance with cyber security regulations by our supply chain; and\n- require  the  review  and  approval  of  contractor  business  systems,  defined  in  the  regulations  as:  (i)  Accounting  System; (ii)  Estimating  System;  (iii)  Earned  Value  Management  System,  for  managing  cost  and  schedule  performance  on  certain complex programs; (iv) Purchasing System; (v) Material Management and Accounting System, for planning, controlling and accounting for the acquisition, use, issuing and disposition of material; and (vi) Property Management System.\n\nThe U.S. Government and other governments may terminate any of our government contracts and subcontracts either at its convenience or for default based on our performance. If a contract is terminated for convenience, we generally are protected by provisions  covering  reimbursement  for  costs  incurred  on  the  contract  and  profit  on  those  costs.  If  a  contract  is  terminated  for default, we generally are entitled to payments for our work that has been accepted by the U.S. Government or other governments; however, the U.S. Government and other governments could make claims to reduce the contract value or recover its procurement costs and could assess other special penalties. For more information regarding the U.S. Government's and other governments' right to terminate our contracts and the risks of doing work internationally, see Item 1A - Risk Factors. For more information regarding government  contracting  laws  and  regulations,  see  Item  1A  -  Risk  Factors  as  well  as  'Critical  Accounting  Policies  -  Contract Accounting / Sales Recognition' in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\nAdditionally,  our  programs  for  the  U.S.  Government  often  operate  for  periods  of  time  under  undefinitized  contract  actions (UCAs),  which  means  that  we  begin  performing  our  obligations  before  the  terms,  specifications  or  price  are  finally  agreed  to between  the  parties. Although  in  most  cases  we  historically  have  reached  mutual  agreement  to  definitize  our  UCAs,  the  U.S. Government has the ability  to  unilaterally  definitize  contracts  and  has  done  so  in  the  past. Absent  a  successful  appeal  of  such action,  the  unilateral  definitization  of  the  contract  obligates  us  to  perform  under  terms  and  conditions  imposed  by  the  U.S. Government.  The  U.S.  Government's  power  to  unilaterally  definitize  a  contract  can  affect  our  ability  to  negotiate  mutually agreeable contract terms and, if a contract is unilaterally imposed upon us, it may negatively affect our expected profit and cash flows on a program or impose burdensome terms.\n\nA portion of our business is classified by the U.S. Government and cannot be specifically described. The operating results of these  classified  contracts  are  included  in  our  consolidated  financial  statements.  The  business  risks  and  capital  requirements associated with classified contracts historically have not differed materially from those of our other U.S. Government contracts. Our internal controls addressing the financial reporting of classified contracts are consistent with our internal controls for our nonclassified contracts.",

      "answer": "Both Emerson and UPS rely on Safe Harbor provisions to protect themselves from liability related to forward-looking statements in their 2023 10-K filings. Emerson specifically uses non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted EBITA and adjusted EBITDA, which exclude restructuring expenses, acquisition-related items, and transaction fees, to provide investors with a clearer view of its operational performance.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Emerson uses non-GAAP financial measures like adjusted EBITA and adjusted EBITDA, which exclude restructuring expenses, acquisition-related items, and transaction fees.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - UPS includes forward-looking statements subject to Safe Harbor provisions, which protect the company from liability as long as the statements are accompanied by cautionary language.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies reference Safe Harbor provisions to disclose forward-looking statements, but Emerson goes further by adjusting financial metrics to clarify operational performance, aligning with the Safe Harbor intent of providing meaningful forward-looking insights without liability for unforeseen outcomes."

In contrast, UPS presents goodwill allocation only at an aggregated level without specifying business unit details, making it more difficult to evaluate unit-level impairment exposure.

      "answer": "EMR recognizes revenue for long-term contracts over time using an input method based on costs incurred, particularly in projects where control transfers gradually to the customer. This means EMR reports earnings progressively as work is completed. In contrast, UPS recognizes revenue over time as it performs transportation services, benefiting from the fact that customers receive value incrementally during the delivery process. If delivery is interrupted, UPS would not need to re-perform the service, affecting its earnings recognition pattern differently than EMR, which relies on cost-based progress toward completion.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - EMR uses an input method for revenue recognition over time, based on costs incurred, which closely corresponds with performance under the contract and transfer of control to the customer.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - UPS recognizes revenue over time as it performs transportation services because customers receive the benefit of the service during the delivery process, and UPS does not need to re-perform services if delivery is interrupted.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The difference in revenue recognition timing affects how each company reports earnings during contract execution: EMR bases its recognition on incurred costs, while UPS recognizes revenue as value is delivered, influencing the pattern and timing of earnings reported in their financial statements."

      "answer": "Program delays negatively impact both General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin, but through different mechanisms. For General Dynamics, program delays are tied directly to U.S. government budget cycles and contract funding availability. If the annual budget is delayed or not approved on time, it can lead to program reductions, delays, or terminations, affecting 70% of GD's consolidated revenue from the U.S. government. For Lockheed Martin, program delays are more closely linked to supplier disruptions and subcontractor performance issues, which can result in increased costs, reduced operating profits, or cash flow delays. Both companies are exposed to risks from program delays, but GD's exposure is primarily through federal budget uncertainty, while LMT's is through supply chain and subcontractor dependencies.",

          "chunk_text": "## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nAn investment in our common stock or debt securities is subject to risks and uncertainties. Investors should consider the following factors, in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10K, before deciding whether to purchase our securities.\n\nInvestment risks can be market-wide as well as unique to a specific industry or company. The market risks faced  by  an  investor  in  our  stock  are  similar  to  the  uncertainties  faced  by  investors  in  a  broad  range  of industries. There are some risks that apply more specifically to our business.\n\nOur revenue is concentrated with the U.S. government. This customer relationship involves some specific risks. In addition, our sales to non-U.S. customers expose us to different financial and legal risks. Despite the varying nature of our government and commercial operations and the markets they serve, each segment shares some common risks, such as the ongoing development of high-technology products and the price, availability and quality of commodities and subsystems.\n\n## Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry\n\nThe  U.S.  government  provides  a  significant  portion  of  our  revenue. In  2021,  70%  of  our  consolidated revenue  was  from  the  U.S.  government.  Levels  of  U.S.  defense  spending  are  driven  by  threats  to  national security.  Competing  demands  for  federal  funds  can  pressure  various  areas  of  spending.  Decreases  in  U.S. government defense and other spending or changes in spending allocation or priorities could result in one or more of our programs being reduced, delayed or terminated, which could impact our financial performance.\n\nFor  additional  information  relating  to  U.S.  budget  matters,  see  the  Business  Environment  section  of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7.\n\nU.S.  government  contracts  are  not  always  fully  funded  at  inception,  and  any  funding  is  subject  to disruption or delay. Our U.S. government revenue is funded by agency budgets that operate on an October-toSeptember fiscal year. Early each calendar year, the President of the United States presents to the Congress the budget for the upcoming fiscal year. This budget proposes funding levels for every federal agency and is the result of months of policy and program reviews throughout the executive branch. For the remainder of the year, the Appropriations and Authorization Committees of the Congress review the President's budget proposals and establish the funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year. Once these levels are enacted into law, the Executive Office of the President administers the funds to the agencies.\n\nThere are two primary risks associated with the U.S. government budget cycle. First, the annual process may be delayed or disrupted. If the annual budget is not approved by the beginning of the government fiscal year, portions of the U.S. government can shut down or operate under a continuing resolution that maintains spending at prior-year levels, which can impact funding for our programs and timing of new awards. Second, the Congress typically appropriates funds on a fiscal-year basis, even though contract performance may extend over  many  years.  Future  revenue  under  existing  multi-year  contracts  is  conditioned  on  the  continuing availability  of  congressional  appropriations.  Changes  in  appropriations  in  subsequent  years  may  impact  the funding available for these programs. Delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of available funds or lead to changes in program content.\n\nOur  government  contracts  are  subject  to  termination  rights  by  the  customer. U.S.  government contracts  generally  permit  the  government  to  terminate  a  contract,  in  whole  or  in  part,  for  convenience.  If  a contract is terminated for convenience, a contractor usually is entitled to receive payments for its",

While we do not anticipate material problems regarding the supply of  our  raw  materials  and  believe  that  we  have  taken  appropriate  measures to mitigate these variations, if key materials become unavailable or if pricing fluctuates widely in the future, it could result in delay of one or more of our programs, increased costs or reduced operating profits or cash flows.\n\nWe rely on other companies to provide materials, major components and products, including advanced microelectronics such as  semiconductors, and to perform a portion of the services that are provided to our customers under the terms of most of our contracts. A failure by one or more of these suppliers or subcontractors to provide the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreedupon services on a timely basis, according to specifications, or at all, may affect our ability to perform our obligations. While we believe we have taken appropriate measures to mitigate these risks, supplier disruptions, including as a result of COVID-19, could result  in  delays,  increased  costs,  or  reduced  operating  profits  or  cash  flows.  For  more  information  on  the  risks  related  to  our suppliers and raw materials, see Item 1A - Risk Factors.\n\nNo material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal. Various factors can affect the distribution of our sales between accounting  periods,  including  the  timing  of  government  awards,  the  availability  of  government  funding,  product  deliveries  and customer acceptance.\n\n## Human Capital Resources\n\nDue to the specialized nature of our business, our performance depends on identifying, attracting, developing, motivating and retaining  a  highly  skilled  workforce  in  multiple  areas,  including  engineering,  science,  manufacturing,  information  technology, cybersecurity, business development and strategy and management. Our human capital management strategy, which we refer to as our people strategy, is tightly aligned with our business needs and technology strategy. During 2021, our human capital efforts were focused  on  continuing  to  accelerate  the  transformation  of  our  technology  for  workforce  management  through  investments  in upgraded systems and processes, and continuing to increase our agility to meet the quickly changing needs of the business, all while  maintaining  a  respectful,  challenging,  supportive  and  inclusive  working  environment. We  use  a  variety  of  human  capital measures  in  managing  our  business,  including:  workforce  demographics;  hiring  metrics;  talent  management  metrics,  including retention rates of top talent; and diversity metrics with respect to representation, attrition, hiring, promotions and leadership.\n\n## Workforce Demographics\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2021,  we  had  a  highly  skilled  workforce  made  up  of  approximately  114,000  employees,  including approximately  59,000  engineers,  scientists  and  information  technology  professionals. As  of  December  31,  2021,  approximately 93% of our workforce was located in the U.S. and approximately 20% of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various unions. A number of our existing collective bargaining agreements expire in any given year. Historically, we have been successful in negotiating renewals to expiring agreements without any material disruption of operating activities, and management considers employee and union relations to be good.\n\n## Diversity and Inclusion\n\nDiversity and inclusion is a business imperative for us, as we believe that it is key to our future success. We have focused our diversity  and  inclusion  initiatives  on  employee  recruitment,  including  investments  in  minority-serving  institutions  and  outreach, employee training and development, such as efforts focused on expanding the diverse talent pipeline, and employee engagement, including  through  participation  in  our  employee  Business  Resource  Groups.  Our  Business  Resource  Groups  are  voluntary, employee-led groups that are open to all employees while focusing on workplace issues specific to racial/ethnic, gender, sexual orientation/gender identity, disability or veteran status. The Business Resource Groups foster a diverse and inclusive workplace aligned  with  our  organizational  mission,  values,  goals  and  business  practices  and  drive  awareness  and  change  within  our organization. Through these and other focused efforts, we have improved the diversity of our overall U.S. workforce and within leadership positions, specifically in the representation of women, people of color and people with disabilities. Additionally, our representation  of  veterans  remains  outstanding,  at  almost  four  times  the  current  annual  national  percentage  of  veterans  in  the civilian workforce.",

The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  and  the  Cost Accounting  Standards  (CAS)  govern  the  majority  of  our  contracts.  The  FAR  mandates uniform  policies  and  procedures  for  U.S.  government  acquisitions  and  purchased  services.  Also,  individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the FAR or that supplement the  FAR.  For  example,  the  DoD  implements  the  FAR  through  the  Defense  Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement  (DFARS).  For  all  federal  government  entities,  the  FAR  regulates  the  phases  of  any  product  or service acquisition, including:\n\n- acquisition planning;\n- competition requirements;\n- contractor qualifications;\n- protection of source selection and supplier information; and\n- acquisition procedures.\n\nIn addition, the FAR addresses the allowability of our costs, while the CAS addresses the allocation of those costs to contracts.

We are also subject to regulations governing investments, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings and import-export control.\n\n## BUSINESS JET AIRCRAFT\n\nThe Aerospace segment is subject to FAA regulation in the United States and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally, including the Civil Aviation Administration of Israel (CAAI), the European Aviation Safety  Agency  (EASA)  and  the  Civil  Aviation  Administration  of  China  (CAAC).  For  an  aircraft  to  be manufactured and sold, the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority, and each  aircraft  must  receive  a  certificate  of  airworthiness.  Aircraft  outfitting  and  completions  also  require approval  by  the  appropriate  aviation  authority,  which  is  often  accomplished  through  a  supplemental  type certificate. Aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval. Maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL\n\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and  regulations  cover  the  discharge,  treatment,  storage,  disposal,  investigation  and  remediation  of  materials, substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations.

International sales are subject to numerous political and economic factors, budget uncertainty, regulatory requirements, significant competition, taxation, and other risks associated with doing business outside the U.S. In international sales, we face substantial competition from both  U.S.  manufacturers  and  international  manufacturers  whose  governments  sometimes  provide  research  and  development assistance, marketing subsidies and other assistance for their products and services.\n\nOur international business is conducted through foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government and by direct commercial sales (DCS) to international customers. FMS contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to the FAR and the DFARS. In contrast, DCS transactions represent sales by us directly to international customers and are not subject to the FAR or the DFARS, although they are subject to the procurement regulations of the international customer. Sales to international customers are subject  to  U.S.  and  foreign  laws  and  regulations,  including  import-export  control,  technology  transfer  restrictions,  investments, taxation,  repatriation  of  earnings,  exchange  controls,  the  Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act  and  other  anti-corruption  laws  and regulations, and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Control Reform Act of 2018. While we have extensive policies in place to comply with such laws and regulations, failure by us, our employees or others working on our behalf to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities, including suspension, debarment from bidding for or performing government contracts, or suspension of our export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We frequently team with international subcontractors and suppliers who also are exposed to similar risks.\n\nInternational  sales  present  risks  that  are  different  and  potentially  greater  than  those  encountered  in  our  U.S.  business.  We believe DCS transactions present the greatest potential risks because they involve direct commercial relationships with parties with whom we typically have less familiarity. Additionally, international procurement and local country rules and regulations, contract laws, and judicial systems differ from those in the U.S. and, in some cases, may be less developed than in the U.S., which could impair our ability to enforce contracts and increase the risk of adverse or unpredictable outcomes, including the possibility that certain matters that would be considered civil matters in the U.S. are treated as criminal matters in other countries.\n\nIn  conjunction  with  defense  procurements,  some  international  customers  require  contractors  to  comply  with  industrial cooperation regulations, including entering into industrial participation or industrial development agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services. Industrial participation or development agreements generally extend over several years and obligate the contractor to perform certain commitments, which may include incountry  purchases,  technology  transfers,  local  manufacturing  support,  consulting  support  to  in-country  projects,  investments  in joint ventures and financial support projects. The customer's expectations in respect of the scope of offset commitments can be substantial, including high-value content, and may exceed existing local technical capability. Failure to meet these commitments, which can be subjective and outside of our control, may result in significant penalties, and could lead to a reduction in sales to a country. Furthermore, certain of our existing industrial development agreements are dependent upon the successful operation of joint ventures that we do not control and involve products and services that are outside of our core business, which may increase the risk that we fail to meet our industrial cooperation agreements, expose us to compliance risks of the joint venture and impair our ability to recover our investment. For more information on our industrial development obligations, including the notional value of our remaining industrial development obligations and potential penalties for non-compliance, see 'Contractual Commitments' in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&amp;A).\n\n## Geopolitical issues and considerations could have a significant effect on our business.\n\nOur international  business  is  highly  sensitive  to  changes  in  regulations  (including  tariffs,  sanctions,  embargoes,  export  and import controls and other trade restrictions), political environments or security risks that may affect our ability to conduct business outside of the U.S., including those regarding investment, procurement, taxation and repatriation of earnings.\n\nOn July 14, 2020 and again on October 26, 2020, the People's Republic of China (China) announced it may impose sanctions against Lockheed Martin in response to Congressional Notifications of potential Foreign Military Sales to Taiwan, which included sales of Lockheed Martin products. We will continue to follow official U.S. Government guidance as it relates to sales to Taiwan and do not see a material impact on our sales at this time. China has not specified the nature of any such sanctions, but could seek to restrict our commercial sales or supply chain, including the supply of rare earth or other raw materials, and could also impose sanctions on our suppliers, teammates or partners. The nature, timing and potential impact of any sanctions that may be imposed by China or any other related actions that may be taken are uncertain.",

      "question": "How do the Phantom Stock Unit programs at General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin differ in terms of payout mechanics and employee eligibility, based on their 2022 disclosures?",
      "answer": "General Dynamics' Phantom Stock Units are participation units tied to the value of company stock and are payable in cash or common stock, with vesting typically occurring over a three-year period. Recipients of restricted stock receive cash dividends and can vote shares, while RSU recipients receive dividend-equivalent units instead. In contrast, Lockheed Martin's Phantom Stock Units are part of the Deferred Management Incentive Compensation Plan (DMICP), where deferred annual incentive bonuses and LTIP payments are credited as phantom stock units at the closing stock price on the deferral date. Dividend equivalents are also credited as stock units. Upon termination, employees receive shares equal to the number of stock units in their DMICP account, with distributions historically sourced from a trust, not newly issued shares, thereby avoiding dilution.",

        "Step 1: From General Dynamics' 2022 10-K, extract details about Phantom Stock Units being participation units tied to stock value, payable in cash or stock, with vesting over three years and mention of dividend treatment differences between restricted stock and RSUs.",
        "Step 2: From Lockheed Martin's 2022 10-K, extract that Phantom Stock Units are part of the DMICP, tied to deferred bonuses, credited at closing stock price, with dividend equivalents, and that distributions come from a trust to avoid dilution.",

(1)\n\nThe shares represent annual incentive bonuses and Long-Term Incentive Performance (LTIP) payments earned and voluntarily deferred by employees. The deferred amounts are payable under the Deferred Management Incentive Compensation Plan (DMICP). Deferred amounts are credited as phantom stock units at the closing price of our stock on the date the deferral is effective. Amounts equal to our dividend are credited as stock units at the time we pay a dividend. Following termination of employment, a number of shares of stock equal to the number of stock units credited to the employee's DMICP account are distributed to the employee. There is no discount or value transfer on the stock distributed. Distributions may be made from newly issued shares or shares purchased on the open market. Historically, all distributions have come from shares held in a separate trust and, therefore, do not further dilute our common shares outstanding. As a result, these shares also were not considered in calculating the total weighted average exercise price in the table. Because the DMICP shares are outstanding, they should be included in the denominator (and not the numerator) of a dilution calculation. (2)\n\n## ITEM 13.

Moreover, after the transaction is completed, the Company will be smaller and less diversified, with a narrower business focus, including a focus on software, innovation and disruptive technologies, and may encounter more volatility and be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, which could adversely affect our business. We also may not be able to redeploy the net proceeds from our divestitures on the timing or with the benefits anticipated.\n\nWe Use a Variety of Raw Materials and Components in Our Businesses, and Significant Shortages or Price Increases Could Increase Our Operating Costs and Adversely Impact the Competitive Positions of Our Products\n\nOur major requirements for raw materials include steel, copper, cast iron, electronics, rare earth metals, aluminum, brass and, to a lesser extent, plastics and petroleum-based chemicals. The Company seeks multiple sources of supply for each of its major requirements in order to avoid significant dependence on any one or a few suppliers. However, the supply of materials or other items could be disrupted by natural disasters, a health epidemic or pandemic, or other events. Significant shortages or price increases could impact the prices our affected businesses charge, their operating costs and the competitive position of their products and services, which could adversely affect our results of operations. While we monitor market prices of the commodities we require and attempt to mitigate price exposure through hedging activities, this risk could adversely affect our operating results.\n\nOur Operations Depend on Production Facilities Throughout the World, a Majority of Which Are Located Outside the United States and Subject to Increased Risks of Disrupted Production, Causing Delays in Shipments and Loss of Customers and Revenue\n\nWe manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide, a majority of which are located outside the United States, and also source certain materials globally. Emerging market sales represent over one-third of total sales and serving a global customer base requires that we place more materials sourcing and production in emerging markets to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain a best-cost position. Our and our suppliers' non-U.S. production facilities and operations could be disrupted by weather and natural disaster (including the potential effects of climate change), labor strife, war (including the Russia-Ukraine conflict), political unrest, terrorist activity or public health concerns such as an epidemic or pandemic, particularly in emerging countries that are not well-equipped to handle such occurrences.\n\nOur manufacturing facilities abroad are dependent on the stability of governments and business conditions and may be more susceptible to changes in laws, policies and regulations in host countries, as well as economic and political upheaval, than our domestic facilities. These facilities face increased risks of nationalization as well as operational disruptions which could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers, and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate us.\n\nAccess to Funding Through the Capital Markets is Essential to the Execution of Our Business Plan, and if We Are Unable to Maintain Such Access We Could Experience a Material Adverse Effect on Our Business and Financial Results\n\nOur ability to invest in our businesses, make strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations requires access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support short-term borrowings. Volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments, or affect the Company's ability to access those markets. If we are unable to continue to access the capital markets, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Additionally, if our customers, suppliers or financial institutions are unable to access the capital markets to meet their commitments to the Company, our business could be adversely impacted.\n\nOur Business Success Depends on the Ability to Attract, Develop and Retain Key Personnel\n\nOur success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management and key employees. Their skills, experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance. The failure to attract, develop and retain highly qualified personnel could adversely affect our ability to succeed in our human capital goals and priorities as well as negatively impact our business and operating results.",

We had $7.0 billion available under our various credit facilities at December 31, 2021.\n\nAlthough our business has been and will continue to be impacted by COVID-19, we currently believe we have sufficient liquidity to withstand the potential impacts.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, we had Cash and cash equivalents of $7.8 billion, of which approximately 34% was held by RTC's foreign subsidiaries.  We  manage  our  worldwide  cash  requirements  by  reviewing  available  funds  among  the  many  subsidiaries  through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. The Company does not intend to reinvest certain undistributed earnings of its international subsidiaries that have been previously taxed in the U.S. Taxes associated with the future remittance of these earnings have been recorded. For the remainder of the Company's undistributed international earnings, unless tax effective to repatriate, RTC will continue to permanently reinvest these earnings.\n\nHistorically, our strong credit ratings and financial position have enabled us to issue long-term debt at favorable market rates.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, our maximum commercial paper borrowing limit was $5.0 billion as the commercial paper is backed by our $5.0 billion revolving credit agreement. We had no commercial paper borrowings as of December 31, 2021. The daily average amount of short-term commercial paper borrowings outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2021 was $175 million. We use  our  commercial  paper  borrowings  for  general  corporate  purposes,  including  the  funding  of  potential  acquisitions,  pension contributions,  debt  refinancing,  dividend  payments  and  repurchases  of  our  common  stock.  The  commercial  paper  notes  have original maturities of not more than 90 days from the date of issuance.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had revolving credit agreements with various banks permitting aggregate borrowings of up to $7.0 billion, consisting of a $5.0 billion revolving credit agreement, which matures in April 2025, and a $2.0 billion revolving credit agreement,  which  we  renewed  in  May  2021  and  expires  in  May  2022. As  of  December  31,  2021,  there  were  no  borrowings outstanding under these agreements.\n\nWe have an existing universal shelf registration statement, which we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on September  27,  2019,  for  an  indeterminate  amount  of  debt  and  equity  securities  for  future  issuance,  subject  to  our  internal limitations on the amount of debt to be issued under this shelf registration statement.\n\nThe  Company  offers  a  voluntary  supply  chain  finance  (SCF)  program  with  a  global  financial  institution  which  enables  our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the Company to the financial institution at a rate that leverages our credit rating, which might be beneficial to them. Our suppliers' participation in the SCF program does not impact or change our terms and conditions with those suppliers, and therefore, we have no economic interest in a supplier's decision to participate in the program. In addition, we provide no guarantees or otherwise pay for any of the costs of the program incurred by those suppliers that choose to participate, and have no direct financial relationship with the financial institution, as it relates to the program. As such, the SCF program does not impact our overall liquidity.\n\nWe believe our cash on hand and future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. Further, we continue to have access to the commercial paper markets and our existing credit facilities, and our ability to obtain debt or",

Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Sufficiency of Audit Evidence over Net Sales\n\nAs discussed in Notes 1, 2 and 18 to the Company's consolidated financial statements, and disclosed in the consolidated statement of earnings, the Company recorded $19.6 billion of net sales in 2022.\n\nWe identified the evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence over net sales as a critical audit matter. Net sales are recognized primarily from the sale of tangible products from hundreds of Company locations around the world. Evaluating the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained required especially subjective auditor judgment because of the geographical dispersion of the Company's net sales generating activities. This included determining the Company locations at which procedures were performed and the supervision and review of procedures performed at those locations.\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor judgment to determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over net sales, including the determination of the Company locations at which those procedures were to be performed. At each Company location where procedures were performed, we:\n\n- Evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company's net sales processes, including the Company's controls over the accurate recording of amounts.\n- Assessed the recorded net sales by selecting a sample of transactions and compared the amounts recognized for consistency with underlying documentation, including contracts with customers and shipping documentation.\n\nEvaluation of the Acquisition Date Fair Value of Certain Acquired Intangible Assets\n\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, on May 16, 2022, the Company consummated a business combination for total consideration of $11.2 billion. In connection with the business combination, the Company recorded various intangible assets, which included customer relationship and developed technology intangible assets with an acquisition date fair value of $2.3 billion and $1.35 billion, respectively.\n\nWe identified the evaluation of the acquisition date fair value of the customer relationship and developed technology intangible assets as a critical audit matter. A high degree of subjective and complex auditor judgment was required to evaluate key assumptions used to value these acquired intangible assets. Specifically, key assumptions included projected revenue for the customer relationship intangible asset and",

These technology networks and systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components; power outages; telecommunications or system failures; terrorist attacks; natural disasters; employee error or malfeasance; server or cloud provider breaches; and computer viruses or cyberattacks. Cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology networks and systems to more sophisticated and targeted measures, known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company, its products, its customers and/or its third-party service providers. Despite the implementation of cybersecurity measures (including access controls, data encryption, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring, and maintenance of backup and protective systems), the Company's information technology systems may still be vulnerable to cybersecurity threats and other electronic security breaches. It is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended period. In addition, it is possible a security breach could result in theft of trade secrets or other intellectual property or disclosure of confidential customer, supplier or employee information. Should the Company be unable to prevent security breaches or other damage to our information technology systems, disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operations, as well as expose the Company to litigation, liability or penalties under privacy laws, increased cybersecurity protection costs, reputational damage and product failure. In addition, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the U.S. and elsewhere. Compliance with privacy and localization laws and regulations increases operational complexity. Failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to fines and penalties, as well as legal and reputational risks, including proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others.\n\nOur Products and Services are Highly Sophisticated and Specialized, and a Major Product Failure or Similar Event Caused by Defects, Cybersecurity Incidents or Other Failures, Could Adversely Affect Our Business, Reputation, Financial Position and Results of Operations\n\nWe produce highly sophisticated products and provide specialized services that incorporate or use complex or leadingedge technology, including both hardware and software. Many of our products and services, including measurement and analytical instrumentation, industrial valves and equipment, and process control systems, are integrated and used in complex process, hybrid and discrete manufacturing environments. As a result, the impact of a catastrophic product failure or similar event could be significant. While we have built operational processes to ensure that our product design, manufacture, performance and servicing meet rigorous quality standards, there can be no assurance that we or our customers or other third parties will not experience operational process or product failures and other problems, including through manufacturing or design defects, process or other failures of contractors or third-party suppliers, cybersecurity incidents or other intentional acts, that could result in potential product, safety, regulatory or environmental risks. Cybersecurity incidents aimed at the software embedded in our products could lead to third-party claims resulting from damages caused by our product failures, and this risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected nature of our products. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include financial loss, reputational damage, litigation with third parties, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.\n\n## Industry and General Economic Risks\n\nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Outbreak Has Adversely Impacted our Business and Could in the Future Have a Material Adverse Impact on our Business, Results of Operation, Financial Condition and Liquidity, the Nature and Extent of Which is Highly Uncertain\n\nThe global outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) has significantly increased economic, demand and operational uncertainty. We have global operations, customers and suppliers, including in countries most impacted by COVID-19. Authorities around the world have taken a variety of measures to slow the spread of COVID-19, including travel bans or restrictions, increased border controls or closures, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business shutdowns (particularly in China where shutdowns continue) and such authorities may impose additional restrictions. We have also taken actions to protect our employees and to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Evolving",

RISK FACTORS\n\nOur business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity can be impacted by the factors set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.\n\n## INDUSTRY RISKS\n\nOur  Business  May  be  Adversely  Affected  by  Changes  in  Global  Economic,  Capital  Market  and  Political  Conditions. Our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions and geopolitical  risks,  including  credit  market  conditions,  the  inflationary  environment  in  the  United  States  and  internationally, levels  of  consumer  and  business  confidence,  commodity  prices,  supply  chain  challenges,  exchange  rates,  potential  changes  in policy positions or priorities, levels of government spending and deficits, the availability and cost of labor, the threat environment, trade policies, political conditions, actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt, and other challenges that could affect the global economy. Given the current inflationary pressures both in the U.S. and in other countries in which we operate, we have and may continue to experience labor and material cost increases at a rate higher than what we have experienced in recent years. Due to the nature of our government and commercial aerospace businesses, and the customer and supplier contracts within those businesses, we may not be able to increase our contract value or pricing to offset these cost increases, in particular on our fixed price contracts. Our  operating  profits  and  margins  under  our  contracts  could  be  adversely  affected  by  these  factors,  particularly  if  the  current inflationary pressures are prolonged. Similarly, expected increases in interest rates from recent historical lows in the U.S. and in other countries in which we operate could negatively impact financial markets and tighten the availability of, and increase the cost of  capital  for  the  Company,  which  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  operating  results,  financial  condition  and  liquidity. Tightening of credit in financial markets also could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations, could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services, and could impact the ability of our customers to make payments. Similarly, such tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base  and  increase  the  potential  for  one  or  more  of  our  suppliers  to  experience  financial  distress  or  bankruptcy.  In  addition, geopolitical risks could affect government priorities, budgets and policies, which could impact sales of defense and other products and services. Our global business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity, such as decreases in  business  and  consumer  spending,  air  travel,  the  financial  strength  of  airlines  and  business  jet  operators,  and  government procurement.\n\nThe  Coronavirus  Disease  2019  (COVID-19)  Pandemic  Has Affected  and  Continues  to Affect  Our  Business,  Supply  Chain, Operations and the Industries in which We Operate. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected our business, supply  chains,  operations  and  the  industries  in  which  we  operate.  As  a  result  of  COVID-19,  governments,  businesses  and individuals  have  taken  actions  such  as  instituting  lockdowns,  quarantines,  border  closings  and  other  travel  restrictions  and requirements, adopting remote working and reducing business and leisure travel, which collectively led to an unprecedented decline in  demand  for  commercial  air  travel.  The  unprecedented  decrease  in  air  travel  adversely  affected  our  airline  and  airframer customers  and  their  demand  for  our  products  and  services. Aircraft  manufacturers  reduced  production  rates  and  cancelled  new airframer  programs,  and,  as  a  result,  demand  for  our  original  equipment  manufacturer  (OEM)  products  decreased.  In  addition, significant declines in aircraft flight hours resulted in reduced demand for our aftermarket parts and services. Airlines and airline leasing companies deferred maintenance services and delayed and cancelled aircraft purchases, negatively impacting our related revenues.  Some  airlines  accelerated  retirement  of  certain  aircraft,  eliminating  demand  for  our  spare  parts  and  our  continuing aftermarket  services  and  negatively  impacting  our  related  aftermarket  revenues. A  significant  portion  of  our  long-term  support contracts are driven by actual usage, and therefore, our related revenues have decreased. Some airlines experienced bankruptcies, and some of our major customers were unable to make timely payment to us. As a result of these developments, we experienced goodwill impairment charges, credit losses on receivables and contract assets, and unfavorable contract adjustments, among other financial impacts, predominantly in 2020. In addition, the border closings, lockdowns and labor shortages resulting from COVID19, as well as the continuing economic recovery, negatively impacted global supply and distribution capabilities. Decreases in the availability of supplies, increases in the cost of supplies, and delivery issues have caused shortages and delays, as well as increased costs, for the procurement of raw materials, components and other supplies required for our performance. Moreover, on September 24,  2021,  in  furtherance  of  an  executive  order,  the  U.S.  Safer  Federal  Workforce  Task  Force  issued  guidance  requiring  federal contractors  and  subcontractors  to  comply  with  COVID-19  safety  protocols,  including  requiring  certain  employees  to  be  fully vaccinated  against  COVID-19  except  in  limited  circumstances.  The  implementation  of  this  mandate  may  result  in  attrition, including  attrition  of  critically  skilled  labor  and  difficulty  in  securing  future  labor  needs,  for  our  workforce,  as  well  as  the workforces of our subcontractors, suppliers and customers. The mandate is currently subject to various legal proceedings. As a result,  the  impact  of  mandate  on  our  operations  and  performance,  as  well  as  on  our  subcontractors,  suppliers  and  customers,  is uncertain. However, if ultimately required, the mandate could affect our performance on contracts, particularly due to disruptions in subcontractor  or  supplier  performance  or  deliveries,  and  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  results  of  operations.  We  also experienced  challenges  from  the  need  to  protect  employee  health  and  safety,  workplace  disruptions  and  restrictions  on  the movement  of  people  and  goods  as  a  result  of  COVID-19.  The  global  economic,  supply  and  demand  uncertainties  caused  by COVID-19 remain. In 2021, new COVID-19",

RTX, as of December 31, 2021, reports a carrying amount of $120 million for liabilities related to indemnities and representations from sales of businesses. Therefore, the total estimated contingent liability for both companies is $120 million. EMR only records contingent liabilities when they are both probable and reasonably estimable and notes that historically payments under indemnities have been inconsequential. RTX accrues for costs associated with guarantees when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated, and it specifically discloses $120 million in liabilities related to indemnifications.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From EMR's 10-K, we learn that as of September 30, 2022, there are no known contingent liabilities, including indemnities, that are material to the company's financial statements, and historically payments under indemnity arrangements have been inconsequential.",
        "Step 2: From RTX's 10-K, we find that the company reports a carrying amount of $120 million at December 31, 2021, for liabilities related to indemnities and representations from sales of businesses.",
        "Step 3: To answer the question, we sum the contingent liabilities (noting that EMR's are negligible) and compare the accounting policies: EMR waits for both probability and estimability before recognizing a liability, while RTX accrues when a liability is probable and reasonably estimable, even if the maximum exposure is not quantifiable.",
        "Step 4: The total contingent liability is therefore $120 million, with RTX being the only company reporting a material amount, and the policies show a contrast in how each company approaches indemnity-related liability recognition."

The Company accrues for such liabilities when it is probable that future costs (including legal fees and expenses) will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are based on developments to date; management's estimates of the outcomes of these matters; and the Company's experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters. The Company engages an outside expert to develop an actuarial estimate of its expected costs to resolve all pending and future asbestos claims, including defense costs, as well as its related insurance receivables. The reserve for asbestos litigation, which is recorded on an undiscounted basis, is based on projected claims through 2065. See Note 19 for additional information about the Company's asbestos liabilities and related insurance receivables.\n\nAlthough it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, the Company historically has been largely successful in defending itself against claims and suits that have been brought against it, and will continue to defend itself vigorously in all such matters. While the Company believes a material adverse impact is unlikely, given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, a remote possibility exists that a future development could have a material adverse impact on the Company. The Company enters into certain indemnification agreements in the ordinary course of business in which the indemnified party is held harmless and is reimbursed for losses incurred from claims by third parties, usually up to a prespecified limit. In connection with divestitures of certain assets or businesses, the Company often provides indemnities to the buyer with respect to certain matters including, for example, environmental or unidentified tax liabilities related to periods prior to the disposition. Because of the uncertain nature of the indemnities, the maximum liability cannot be quantified. As such, contingent liabilities are recorded when they are both probable and reasonably estimable. Historically, payments under indemnity arrangements have been inconsequential.\n\nAt September 30, 2022, there were no known contingent liabilities (including guarantees, pending litigation, taxes and other claims) that management believes will be material in relation to the Company's financial statements, nor were there any material commitments outside the normal course of business.\n\n## (14) INCOME TAXES\n\nPretax earnings consist of the following:\n\n",

Collaboration  partners'  share  of  these  financing  guarantees  is  $141  million  and  $142  million  at  December  31,  2021  and  2020, respectively.\n\nWe also have obligations arising from sales of certain businesses and assets, including those from representations and warranties and related indemnities for environmental, health and safety, tax and employment matters. The maximum potential payment related to these obligations is not a specified amount as a number of the obligations do not contain financial caps. The carrying amount of liabilities related to these obligations was $120 million at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. For additional information regarding the environmental indemnifications, see 'Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies.'\n\nWe  accrue  for  costs  associated  with  guarantees  when  it  is  probable  that  a  liability  has  been  incurred  and  the  amount  can  be reasonably estimated. The most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts, and where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, the minimum is accrued.\n\nWe also provide service and warranty policies on our products and extend performance and operating cost guarantees beyond our normal  service  and  warranty  policies  on  some  of  our  products,  particularly  commercial  aircraft  engines.  In  addition,  we  incur discretionary costs to service our products in connection with specific product performance issues. Liabilities for performance and operating cost guarantees are based upon future product performance and durability, and are largely estimated based upon historical experience. Adjustments are made to accruals as claims data and historical experience warrant.

      "answer": "Changes in U.S.-China trade agreements could impact Boeing's commercial aircraft backlog because China represents a key market for Boeing\u2019s commercial aircraft, and ongoing economic and national security concerns have stalled the trade relationship. Boeing is already exposed to tariffs on certain aircraft parts and components it procures from China, and a further deterioration could lead to reduced backlog or order cancellations. Boeing is mitigating import costs through Duty-Drawback Customs procedures. On the other hand, Union Pacific's revenues are partially tied to the transportation of commodities to and from international markets, including China. A significant and sustained interruption in trade with China, potentially caused by changes in trade agreements like those under scrutiny, could adversely affect Union Pacific's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Union Pacific specifically notes that changes in trade agreements or policies could lead to increased tariffs, which would raise costs and reduce availability of critical rail infrastructure materials.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Boeing\u2019s commercial aircraft backlog is significantly tied to Chinese customers, and Boeing is already affected by U.S.-China tariffs on aircraft parts, with mitigations through Duty-Drawback Customs procedures.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Union Pacific\u2019s revenues are partially dependent on international trade, including with China, and changes in trade agreements could lead to significant interruptions in trade, affecting both customer demand and the cost of rail infrastructure due to increased tariffs.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are exposed to U.S.-China trade dynamics: Boeing through direct aircraft sales and component tariffs, and Union Pacific through trade flow dependencies and infrastructure costs. Each is monitoring the geopolitical and regulatory environment and applying mitigation strategies."

      "answer": "BA does not explicitly classify its limited partnership (LP) investments within the fair value hierarchy, but it indicates that real estate and real assets, which may be held through LPs or other fund structures, rely on valuation methodologies such as public market multiples, market transactions for comparable companies, and other methods applied by investment managers. In contrast, UNP specifically classifies its investments in limited partnerships, including venture capital and buyout partnerships, as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy, indicating that these valuations rely on unobservable inputs. UNP further details that these valuations are derived from public market multiples applied to private company cash flows, market transactions for comparable firms, and NAV calculated by general partners. Thus, while both firms use similar methodologies, UNP explicitly categorizes these as Level 3 assets due to the lack of observable pricing, whereas BA does not specify a hierarchy level.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize the two: Both firms use similar valuation methodologies for LPs, but only UNP clearly places them in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, while BA does not disclose a classification."

UNP, on the other hand, has specific future commitments totaling $80 million to private equity partnerships and $5 million to real estate partnerships as of December 31, 2023.

Union Pacific, on the other hand, does not report a specific dollar amount for municipal bonds but classifies them under 'Bonds and Debentures,' which are valued using a bid evaluation process with bid data from independent pricing sources and are categorized as Level 2 investments.

      "question": "How do the fair value measurement hierarchies described by Emerson (EMR) and 3M (MMM) under ASC 820 differ in terms of the reliability of valuation inputs used for their financial instruments, and what does this indicate about the nature of their respective asset portfolios?",
      "answer": "Emerson (EMR) states that all of its financial instruments fall within Level 2 of the ASC 820 fair value hierarchy, which uses broker/dealer quotations or other market-observable inputs for similar items in active markets, indicating that its valuations rely on inputs that are not directly based on identical, actively traded assets but are still largely market-informed. In contrast, 3M (MMM) follows the same ASC 820 framework but explicitly emphasizes its use of a valuation hierarchy that prioritizes observable inputs (Level 1 and Level 2) and includes a broader discussion of unobservable inputs (Level 3) being used only when necessary. However, 3M notes that it uses Level 2 and Level 1 inputs when available, and only resorts to Level 3 when observable data is lacking. This suggests that 3M's asset portfolio may include a wider range of assets, some of which may be more unique or less actively traded than Emerson\u2019s, requiring a more nuanced application of valuation techniques.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from EMR's 10-K - All of Emerson\u2019s financial instruments fall within Level 2 of the ASC 820 fair value hierarchy, using broker/dealer quotations or other market-observable inputs.",
        "Step 2: Extract from MMM's 10-K - 3M follows ASC 820 and categorizes fair value measurements into three levels, emphasizing the use of observable inputs (Level 1 and Level 2) when available, and only using Level 3 (unobservable inputs) when necessary.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While both companies follow ASC 820, Emerson exclusively reports Level 2 valuations, suggesting a more standardized asset base, whereas 3M's broader discussion of Level 3 implies potential complexity or uniqueness in some of its assets, requiring deeper internal assumptions."

Fair value is defined as the ex it price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The standard establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company's assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\n\nLeases: 3M determines if an arrangement is a lease upon inception by establishing if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in ex change for consideration. 3M determines certain service agreements that contain the right to use an underlying asset are not leases because 3M does not control how and for what purpose the identified asset is used.\n\nOperating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The discount rate used is 3M's incremental borrowing rate or, if available, the rate implicit in the lease. 3M determines the incremental borrowing rate for leases using a portfolio approach based primarily on the lease term and the economic environment of the applicable country or region.\n\nAs a lessee, the Company leases distribution centers, office space, land, and equipment. Certain 3M lease agreements include rental payments adjusted annually based on changes in an inflation index. 3M's leases do not contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nCertain leases include one or more options to renew, with terms that can extend the lease term up to five years. 3M includes options to renew the lease as part of the right of use lease asset and liability when it is reasonably certain the Company will ex ercise the option. In addition, certain leases contain fair value purchase and termination options with an associated penalty. In general, 3M is not reasonably certain to exercise such options.\n\nFor the measurement and classification of its lease agreements, 3M groups lease and non-lease components into a single lease component for all underlying asset classes. Variable lease payments primarily include payments for non-lease components, such as maintenance costs, payments for leased assets used beyond their noncancellable lease term as adjusted for contractual options to terminate or renew, additional payments related to a subsequent adjustment in an inflation index, and payments for non-components such as sales tax. Certain 3M leases contain immaterial variable lease payments based on number of units produced.\n\nRelated Party Activity: 3M does not have any material related party activity.",

      "answer": "3M (MMM) derived 56% of its revenues from outside the United States in 2024, making it highly susceptible to foreign exchange fluctuations. Emerson Electric Co. (EMR) operates globally across multiple business segments, including international operations that are subject to risks such as adverse changes in exchange rates.

Actual future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those reflected in any such forward-looking statements depending on a variety of factors. Important information as to these factors can be found in this document, including, among others, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' under the headings of 'Overview,' 'Financial Condition and Liquidity' and annually in 'Critical Accounting Estimates.' Discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference from Part I, Item 1A, 'Risk Factors,' of this document, and should be considered an integral part of Part II, Item 7, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.' For additional information concerning factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements, see our reports on Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filed with the SEC from time to time.\n\n## Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\nProvided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the Company. Discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of Part II, Item 7, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.'\n\n## Risks Related to the Global Economy and External Conditions\n\n* The Company's results are impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic, political, regulatory, international trade, geopolitical, and other external conditions.\n\nDuring 2024, the Company derived approximately 56 percent of its revenues from outside the United States. Accordingly, the Company's operations and the execution of its business strategies and plans are subject to global competition and economic and geopolitical risks that are beyond its control, such as, among other things, disruptions in financial markets, economic downturns, military conflicts, terrorism, public health emergencies, political changes and trends such as protectionism, economic nationalism resulting in government actions impacting international trade agreements or imposing trade restrictions such as tariffs and retaliatory counter measures, and government deficit reduction and other austerity measures in locations or industries in which the Company operates. Further escalation of specific trade tensions, including those between the U.S. and China, or more broadly in global trade conflict, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and operations around the world. The Company's business is also impacted by social, political, and labor conditions in locations in which the Company or its suppliers or customers operate; adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital; monetary policy; interest rates; inflation; recession; commodity prices; currency volatility or exchange control; ability to expatriate earnings; and other laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company or its suppliers or customers operate. For example, changes in local economic condition or outlooks, such as lower economic growth rates in China, Europe, or other key markets, impact the demand or profitability of the Company's products.\n\nThe global economy has been impacted by geopolitical tensions. The U.S. and other governments have imposed export controls on certain products and financial and economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in certain conflict zones. These geopolitical tensions could result in, among other things, cyberattacks, supply chain disruptions, higher energy and other commodity costs, lower consumer demand, and changes to foreign exchange rates and financial markets, any of which may have a material adverse effect the Company's business and supply chain.\n\nClimate change and severe weather events, including related environmental and social regulations, as well as natural disasters, may negatively impact the Company or its customers and suppliers, in terms of availability and cost of natural resources, sources and supply of energy, product demand and manufacturing, compliance costs, and the health and well-being of individuals and communities in which we or our suppliers or customers operate.\n\n* Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company's ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings.\n\nThe Company's financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and, as noted above, the Company derives a significant percentage of its revenues from outside the United States. As a result, the Company's results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be materially adversely impacted if the U.S. dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies, and the Company's results of operations may experience volatility related to changes in ex change rates. For a discussion of the impact of foreign currency ex change rates on the Company, see Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\n\n## Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Proceedings\n\n* The Company faces liabilities related to certain fluorochemicals, which could have a material adverse effect on our results.\n\nAs previously reported, governments in the United States and internationally have increasingly been regulating a broad group of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances produced by the Company, collectively known as 'PFAS,' including some presently or historically produced by the Company.",

The 2024 performance criteria for these performance shares (organic sales growth, free cash flow growth, and earnings per share growth) were selected because the Company believes that they are important drivers of long-term stockholder value. The number of shares of 3M common stock that could actually be distributed at the end of the three-year performance period may be anywhere from 0% to 200% of each performance share granted, depending on the performance of the Company during such performance period. When granted, these performance shares are awarded at 100% of the estimated number of shares at the end of the three-year performance period and are reflected under 'Granted' in the table below. Non-substantive vesting requires that expense for the performance shares be recognized over one or three years depending on when each individual became a 3M executive. The performance share grants accrue dividends; therefore, the grant date fair value is equal to the closing stock price on the date of grant. Since the rights to dividends are forfeitable, there is no impact on basic earnings per share calculations. Weighted average performance shares whose performance period is complete are included in computation of diluted earnings per share.\n\nThe following table summarizes performance share activity:\n\n",

The development and protection of intellectual property rights are a source of competitive advantage within our industry, and protection of key design, manufacturing, repair and product upgrade technologies is important to our business. We maintain, continue to grow, and curate a portfolio of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights stemming from our research and development activities. In some circumstances we license intellectual property to commercial customers, such as to support the maintenance and repair of our products to keep them in safe and airworthy condition. Government customers may also have licenses to some of our intellectual property that is developed or used in the performance of government contracts. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to our business, we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on the preservation of any singular intellectual property right or patent license. The 'GE' name and logo are licensed to various former businesses, including GE HealthCare and GE Vernova, pursuant to agreements governing their use.\n\nSUPPLY CHAIN. We rely on a global supply chain for a wide range of raw materials, commodities, components, parts, M RO services and other indirect spend. Our supply chain is complex and extends into many different countries and regions around the world. We depend on the ability of our suppliers and partners to meet quality standards, performance specifications and delivery schedules at our anticipated costs. In some cases, we also must comply with specific procurement requirements that limit the suppliers and subcontractors we may utilize. Some of our suppliers or their sub-suppliers are limited- or sole-source suppliers, and our ability  to meet our obligations to customers depends on the product quality, performance, continued product availability and stability of such suppliers. We employ a number of strategies focused on continuity of supply of raw materials, including monitoring geopolitical and geographical changes and developing counteractions in response to identified risks, evaluating alternate materials and sources and working with suppliers to secure both short- and long-term capacity. Partnering with suppliers, leveraging FLIGHT DECK, we are working to improve material input, supporting our deliveries across internal shop visits, spare part sales and equipment. We operate in a supply-constrained environment that has impacted our industry for the past several years. See the M D&amp;A section for additional discussion of these dynamics.\n\nCOMPETITION. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive in terms of pricing, product and service quality, durability and reliability, product development and introduction time, intellectual property, customer service, financing terms, the ability to respond to shifts in market demand and the ability to attract and retain skilled talent. We compete with other global engine manufacturers in sales of commercial and defense engines and services. Key competitors in commercial engine services also include third-party M RO shops. In DPT, we compete against a range of U.S. and non-U.S. companies or groups for contract and subcontract awards by governments and their prime contractors. Customer selections for aircraft engines, components and systems can also have a significant impact on future sales of parts and services over the life of an engine platform. Competitors may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives, performance and operating cost guarantees and participation in financing arrangements in an effort to secure an installed base that establishes aftermarket sales associated with these products.\n\nREGULATORY MATTERS. As an aerospace and defense company, we are subject to a wide range of U.S. federal, state and non-U.S. laws and regulations related to our products, services and business operations, including the significant areas of law and regulation summarized below that can apply to our business directly and indirectly. Like other industrial manufacturing companies that operate globally in high-tech sectors, we face significant scrutiny from both U.S. and foreign governmental authorities with respect to regulatory compliance. We regularly engage with our regulators and work to comply with existing, new and changing requirements across relevant jurisdictions, as compliance (or failure to properly comply) with any of these requirements can pose costs and impact our operations.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nGeneral  Dynamics is  a  global  aerospace  and  defense  com pany  that  offers  a  broad  portfolio  of  products  and  services  in  business  aviation;  ship construction and repair; land com bat vehicles, weapons system s and m unitions; and technology products and services.\n\nThe  following  is  a  discussion  of  certain  significant  accounting  policies,  and  further  discussion  is  contained  in  other  notes  to  these  financial statements.\n\nBasis of Consolidation and Classification. The Consolidated Financial Statem ents include the accounts of General Dynam ics Corporation and our  wholly  owned  and  m ajority-owned  subsidiaries.  W e  elim inate  all  intercom pany  balances  and  transactions  in  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements.\n\nConsistent with industry practice, we classify assets and liabilities related to long-term  contracts as current, even though som e of these am ounts may not be realized within one year.\n\nUse of Estimates. The nature of our business requires that we m ake estim ates and assum ptions in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These estim ates and assum ptions affect the reported am ounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statem ents, as well as the reported am ounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. W e base our estim ates on historical experience, currently available inform ation and various other assum ptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results m ay differ from  these estim ates.\n\nResearch and Development Expenses. Company-sponsored research and development (R&amp;D) expenses, including Aerospace productdevelopment costs, were $565 in 2024, $510 in 2023 and $480 in 2022.  R&amp;D expenses are included in operating costs and expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings in the period in which they are incurred. Custom er-sponsored R&amp;D expenses are charged directly to the related contracts.\n\nThe Aerospace segment has cost-sharing arrangem ents with som e of its suppliers that enhance the segm ent's internal developm ent capabilities and offset a portion of the financial cost associated with the segm ent's product developm ent efforts. These arrangem ents explicitly state that supplier contributions are for reim bursem ent of costs we incur in the developm ent of new aircraft m odels and technologies, and we retain substantial rights in the  products  developed  under  these  arrangem ents.  W e  record  am ounts  received  from   these  cost-sharing  arrangem ents  as  a  reduction  of  R&amp;D expenses. We have no obligation to refund any am ounts received under the agreem ents regardless of the outcom e of the developm ent efforts. Under the typical term s of an agreem ent, paym ents received from  suppliers for their share of the costs are based on m ilestones and are recognized as received. Our policy is to defer paym ents in excess of the costs we have incurred.\n\nInterest, Net. Net interest expense consisted of the following:\n\n",

Refer to the Other Items - Insurance section for further discussion of the accounting estimates and assumptions in our insurance reserves and their sensitivity to change. See Notes 1 and 12 for further information.\n\nPENSION ASSUMPTIONS. Refer to Note 13 for our accounting estimates and assumptions related to our postretirement benefit plans.\n\nINCOME TAXES. Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, this rate can depend on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Historically U.S. taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings. Due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform in 2017, substantially all of our unrepatriated net earnings have been subject to U.S. tax and accordingly we expect to have the ability to repatriate available non-U.S. cash without significant additional tax cost. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. M ost of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. We reassess reinvestment of earnings on an ongoing basis.\n\nWe evaluate the recoverability of deferred income tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies, which rely on reasonable estimates. We use our historical experience and our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight. Further, our global and diversified business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. A mounts recorded for deferred tax assets related to non-U.S. net operating losses, net of valuation allowances, were $0.5 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Of this, an insignificant amount and $0.6 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively, were associated with losses reported in discontinued operations, primarily related to our GE V ernova, GE HealthCare and legacy financial services businesses. See Other Consolidated Information - Income Taxes section and Notes 1 and 15 for further information.\n\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES. Loss contingencies are existing conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when future events occur or fail to occur. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to, environmental, health and safety matters, litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, government contracts, employee benefit plans, product quality guarantees and losses resulting from other events and developments. In particular, the design, development, production and support of aerospace products is inherently complex and subject to risk. Technical issues associated with these products may arise in the normal course and may result in financial impacts, including increased warranty provisions, customer contract settlements, and changes in contract performance estimates. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. When there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and negotiations with or decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. M oreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. Disclosure is provided for material loss contingencies when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We regularly review contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. See Note 24 for further information.\n\n## OTHER ITEMS\n\nINSURANCE. Our run-off insurance operations include Employers Reassurance Corporation (ERAC) and Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC). ERAC primarily assumed long-term care insurance and life insurance from numerous cedents under various types of reinsurance treaties and stopped accepting new policies after 2008. UFLIC primarily assumed long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities with and without life contingencies and variable annuities from Genworth Financial Inc. (Genworth) and has been closed to new business since 2004.\n\n## Key Portfolio Characteristics\n\nLong-term care insurance contracts. The long-term care insurance contracts we reinsure provide coverage at varying levels of benefits to policyholders and may include attributes (e.g., lifetime benefit periods, inflation protection options, and joint life policies) that could result in claimants being on claim for longer periods or at higher daily claim costs, or alternatively limiting the premium paying period, compared to contracts with a lower level of benefits. Presented in the table below are reserve balances and key attributes of our long-term care insurance portfolio.",

Therefore, GD did not record any goodwill impairment loss in its financial statements for 2024. In contrast, GE performed both an interim and annual impairment test. During the interim test in Q3 2024 for its Colibrium Additive reporting unit, GE found that the carrying value exceeded fair value, leading to a non-cash goodwill impairment loss of $251 million, which was reflected in its Statement of Earnings (Loss). GE\u2019s annual impairment test in Q4 2024, however, showed that the fair values of all other reporting units exceeded their carrying values, indicating no further impairment. Thus, the impairment loss of $251 million for Colibrium Additive was a significant item in GE\u2019s 2024 financials, while GD reported no such loss.",

A performance obligation is a prom ise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the custom er, and is the unit of account for revenue. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct perform ance obligation within that contract and recognized as revenue when, or as, the perform ance obligation is satisfied. Our perform ance obligations are satisfied over tim e as work progresses or at a point in tim e.\n\nSubstantially all of our revenue in the defense segm ents is recognized over tim e because control is transferred continuously to our custom ers. Typically , revenue is recognized over tim e using costs incurred to date relative to total estim ated costs at com pletion to m easure progress toward satisfyi ng our perform ance obligations. Incurred costs represent work perform ed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the custom er.\n\nMost of our revenue recognized at a point in tim e is for the m anufacture of business jet aircraft in our Aerospace segm ent. Revenue on these contracts is recognized when the custom er obtains control of the asset, which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the custom er of the fully outfitted aircraft.\n\nThe majority of our revenue is derived from  long-term  contracts and program s that can span several years. Accounting for long-term  contracts and  programs  involves  the  use  of  various  techniques  to  estim ate  total  contract  revenue  and  costs.  W e  estim ate  the  profit  on  a  contract  as  the difference between the total estim ated revenue and expected costs to com plete a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract. For discussion  of  our  contract  estim ates,  the  assum ptions  used,  and  the  im pact  of  changes  in  estim ates,  see  Note  B  to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements in Item  8.\n\nConsistent with industry practice, we classify assets and liabilities related to long-term  contracts as current, even though som e of these am ounts may not be realized within one year. The tim ing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable, unbilled receivables (contract assets), and custom er advances and deposits (contract liabilities) on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These assets and liabilities are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.\n\nLong-lived Assets and  Goodwill. We review long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to am ortization, for im pairm ent whenever events or changes in circum stances indicate that the carrying value of the assets m ay not be recoverable. W e assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of undiscounted projected cash flows. Im pairm ent losses, where identified, are m easured as the excess of the carrying value of the long-lived assets over the estim ated fair value as determ ined by discounted cash flows.\n\nGoodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business com bination. We review goodwill for im pairm ent annually at each of our reporting units or when circum stances indicate that the likelihood of an im pairm ent is greater than 50%. Such circum stances include a significant adverse change in the business clim ate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit.

We assess the possibility that a reporting unit's fair value has been reduced below its carrying amount due to the occurrence of events or circumstances between annual impairment testing dates. In the third quarter of 2024, we performed an interim impairment test at our Colibrium A dditive reporting unit within our Defense &amp; Propulsion Technologies segment given declines in the additive manufacturing industry due to slower adoption of technology, which incorporated a combination of income and market valuation approaches. The results of the analysis indicated that the carrying value of the reporting unit was in excess of fair value and, therefore, we recorded a non-cash impairment loss of $251 million in Goodwill impairments in our Statement of Earnings (Loss).

This method aligns revenue recognition with work performed and provides a continuous assessment of profitability.

A one percentage point change in GE's profitability estimates would affect its long-term service agreements balance by $0.4 billion, highlighting its sensitivity to estimation changes.

W e em ploy judgm ent in  m aking  our  estim ates,  but  they  are  based  on  historical  experience,  currently available inform ation and various other assum ptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circum stances.

A performance obligation is a prom ise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the custom er, and is the unit of account for revenue. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct perform ance obligation within that contract and recognized as revenue when, or as, the perform ance obligation is satisfied. Our perform ance obligations are satisfied over tim e as work progresses or at a point in tim e.\n\nSubstantially all of our revenue in the defense segm ents is recognized over tim e because control is transferred continuously to our custom ers. Typically , revenue is recognized over tim e using costs incurred to date relative to total estim ated costs at com pletion to m easure progress toward satisfyi ng our perform ance obligations. Incurred costs represent work perform ed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the custom er.\n\nMost of our revenue recognized at a point in tim e is for the m anufacture of business jet aircraft in our Aerospace segm ent. Revenue on these contracts is recognized when the custom er obtains control of the asset, which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the custom er of the fully outfitted aircraft.\n\nThe majority of our revenue is derived from  long-term  contracts and program s that can span several years. Accounting for long-term  contracts and  programs  involves  the  use  of  various  techniques  to  estim ate  total  contract  revenue  and  costs.  W e  estim ate  the  profit  on  a  contract  as  the difference between the total estim ated revenue and expected costs to com plete a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract. For discussion  of  our  contract  estim ates,  the  assum ptions  used,  and  the  im pact  of  changes  in  estim ates,  see  Note  B  to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements in Item  8.\n\nConsistent with industry practice, we classify assets and liabilities related to long-term  contracts as current, even though som e of these am ounts may not be realized within one year. The tim ing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable, unbilled receivables (contract assets), and custom er advances and deposits (contract liabilities) on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These assets and liabilities are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.\n\nLong-lived Assets and  Goodwill. We review long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to am ortization, for im pairm ent whenever events or changes in circum stances indicate that the carrying value of the assets m ay not be recoverable. W e assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of undiscounted projected cash flows. Im pairm ent losses, where identified, are m easured as the excess of the carrying value of the long-lived assets over the estim ated fair value as determ ined by discounted cash flows.\n\nGoodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business com bination. We review goodwill for im pairm ent annually at each of our reporting units or when circum stances indicate that the likelihood of an im pairm ent is greater than 50%. Such circum stances include a significant adverse change in the business clim ate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit.

          "chunk_text": "REVENUE RECOGNITION ON LONG -TERM SERVICES AG REEMENTS. We enter into long-term services agreements with our customers, predominantly within the CES segment, that require us to maintain the customers' assets over the contract terms, which generally range from 5 to 25 years. Contract modifications that extend or revise contracts are not uncommon. We recognize revenue as we perform under the arrangements using the percentage of completion method which is based on our costs incurred to date relative to our estimate of total expected costs. This requires us to make estimates of customer payments expected to be received over the current contract term as well as the costs to perform required maintenance services.\n\nOur rights to consideration for these arrangements are generally based on the utilization of the asset (e.g., per hour of usage) and contractual payment terms are based on either periodic billing schedules or upon the occurrence of a maintenance event, such as an overhaul. A s a result, a significant estimate in determining expected revenue of a contract is estimating how customers will utilize their assets over the term of the agreement. The estimate of utilization, which can change over the contract life, impacts both the amount of customer payments we expect to receive and our estimate of future contract costs. Customers' asset utilization will influence the timing and extent of overhauls and other service events over the life of the contract. We generally use a combination of both historical utilization trends as well as forward-looking information such as market conditions and potential asset retirements in developing our revenue estimates.\n\nTo develop our cost estimates, we consider the timing and extent of future maintenance and overhaul events, including the frequency of maintenance events and cost of labor, spare parts and other resources required to perform the maintenance. In developing our cost estimates, we utilize a combination of our historical cost experience and expected cost improvements. Cost improvements are only included in future cost estimates after savings have been observed in actual results or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process.\n\nWe routinely review estimates and revise them to adjust for changes in outlook. Changes in estimates are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis with an adjustment to revenue in the current period. These revisions are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review. Contract modifications that change the rights and obligations, as well as the nature, timing and extent of future cash flows, are evaluated for potential price concessions, contract asset impairments and significant financing to determine if adjustments of earnings are required before effectively accounting for a modified contract as a new contract.\n\nWe regularly assess expected billings adjustments and customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract assets, including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination. We gain insight into future utilization and cost trends, as well as credit risk, through our knowledge of the installed base of equipment and fleet management strategies through close interaction with our customers that comes with supplying critical services and parts over extended periods. Revisions may affect a long-term services agreement's total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings.\n\nOn December 31, 2024, our long-term service agreements net liability balance of $6.6 billion represents approximately 4.1% of our total estimated life of contract billings of $162 billion. Our contracts (on average) are approximately 18.4% complete based on costs incurred to date and our estimate of future costs. Revisions to our estimates of future billings or costs that increase or decrease total estimated contract profitability by one percentage point would increase or decrease the long-term service agreements balance by $0.4 billion. Billings collected on these contracts were $8.6 billion and $8.1 billion during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See Notes 1 and 8 for further information.\n\nNONRECURRING ENGINEERING  COSTS. We incur contract fulfillment costs for engineering and development of products directly related to existing or anticipated contracts with customers, primarily in our Defense &amp; Propulsion Technologies segment. Contract fulfillment costs are capitalized to the extent recoverable from the customer contract, and subsequently amortized as the products are delivered to the customer. We periodically assess the recoverability of capitalized contract fulfillment costs, which requires significant judgement. Specifically, we estimate program volumes, contract revenue based on negotiated prices, and product costs based on input costs, inflation and productivity. See Note 8 for further information.\n\nIMPAIRMENT OF G OODWILL AND OTHER IDENTIFIED INTANG IBLE ASSETS . Goodwill is subject to annual, or more frequent, if necessary, impairment testing. In the impairment test, the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts, including strategic and annual operating plans, adjusted for terminal value assumptions, or a market approach, when available and appropriate, utilizing market observable pricing multiples of similar businesses and comparable transactions, or both. These impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, and changes to those assumptions could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. To address this uncertainty, we perform sensitivity analyses on key estimates and assumptions. Once the fair value is determined, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, it is impaired. In the fourth quarter of each y ear, we perform our annual impairment test. See Note 7 for further information.\n\nWe review identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Determining whether an impairment loss has occurred requires the use of our internal forecast to estimate future cash flows and the useful life over which these cash flows will occur. To determine fair value, we use our internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate discount rate. See Notes 1 and 7 for further information.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 17",

In contrast, GE reported $1,412 million in fixed income and cash investment funds for 2024 under its principal pension plan, though it did not explicitly break down these funds by Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

This ASU requires an entity to disclose the amounts of purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, and intangible asset amortization included in each relevant expense caption. It also requires an entity to include certain amounts that are already required to be disclosed under current GAAP in the same disclosure. Additionally, it requires an entity to disclose a qualitative description of the amounts remaining in relevant ex pense captions that are not separately disaggregated quantitatively, and to disclose the total amount of selling expenses and, in annual reporting periods, an entity's definition of selling ex penses. The amendments in the ASU are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. An entity may apply the amendments prospectively for reporting periods after the effective date or retrospectively to any or all prior periods presented in the financial statements. While this ASU will impact only our disclosures and not our financial condition and results of operations, we are currently evaluating when we will adopt the ASU.\n\nIn March 2024, the SEC issued a final rule under SEC Release Nos. 33-11275 and 34-99678, The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors, that would require us to provide climate-related disclosures in our annual reports and registration statements beginning with our annual report for the year ending December 31, 2025. The rule would require disclosure of material climate-related risks, our governance and risk management of climate-related risks and any material climate-related targets or goals, greenhouse gas emissions as well as disclosure of the financial statement effects, such as costs and losses resulting from severe weather events and other natural conditions. In April 2024, the SEC released an order staying this final rule pending judicial review of all the petitions challenging the rule. We are in the process of analyzing the impact of the rule and related litigation on our disclosures.\n\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires a public entity to disclose significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis and provide in interim periods all disclosures about a reportable segment's profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. Additionally, it requires a public entity to disclose the title and position of the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). The ASU does not change how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates them, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. We adopted the new standard effective December 31, 2024. As a result, we have enhanced our segment disclosures to include the presentation of cost of sales by segment and the disclosure of our CODMs. The adoption of this ASU affects only our disclosures, with no impacts to our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIn  December  2023,  the  FASB  issued ASU  No.  2023-09,  Income  Taxes  (Topic  740):  Improvements  to  Income  Tax  Disclosures,  which  focuses  on  the  rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. ASU No. 2023-09 requires a public business entity (PBE) to disclose, on an annual basis, a tabular rate reconciliation using both percentages and currency amounts, broken out into specified categories with certain reconciling items further broken out by nature and jurisdiction to the extent those  items  ex ceed  a  specified  threshold.  In  addition,  all  entities  are  required  to  disclose  income  tax es  paid,  net  of  refunds  received  disaggregated  by  federal, state/local, and foreign and by jurisdiction if the amount is at least 5% of total income tax  payments, net of refunds received. For PBEs, the new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. An entity may apply the amendments in this ASU prospectively by providing the  revised  disclosures  for  the  period  ending  December  31,  2025  and  continuing  to  provide  the  pre-ASU  disclosures  for  the  prior  periods,  or  may  apply  the amendments retrospectively by providing the revised disclosures for all periods presented. We will adopt this ASU prospectively for the period ending December 31, 2025, and it will impact only our disclosures with no impacts to our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Note 2 - E arnings Per Share\n\nThe weighted average number of shares outstanding used to compute earnings per common share were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Cybersecurity Strategy and Risk Management\n\nCybersecurity is critical to advancing our overall objectives and enabling our digital efforts. As a global company, we face a wide variety of cybersecurity threats that range from common attacks such as ransomware and denial-of-service, to attacks from more advanced adversaries. Our customers, suppliers, and other partners face similar cybersecurity threats, and a cybersecurity incident impacting these entities could materially adversely affect our operations, performance and results. These cybersecurity threats and related risks make it imperative that we maintain focus on cybersecurity and systemic risks.\n\nWe maintain a comprehensive cybersecurity program which is integrated within the Company's enterprise risk management system and encompasses the corporate information technology and operational technology environments as well as customer-facing products. Our cybersecurity program has implemented a governance structure and process to identify, assess, manage, mitigate, respond to and report on cybersecurity risks. We utilize cybersecurity policies and frameworks based on industry and government standards. Our cyber risk management program controls are based on recognized best practices and standards, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cyber Security Framework and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO 27001) Information Security Management System Requirements. We partner with third parties to support and evaluate our cybersecurity program. These third-party services span areas including cybersecurity maturity assessments, incident response, penetration testing, consulting on best practices, and others. We also consume threat intelligence from several paid and non-paid sources.\n\nWe maintain a 24 x 7 operations center which serves as a central location for the reporting of cybersecurity matters, provides monitoring of our global cybersecurity environment, and coordinates the investigation and remediation of alerts. As cybersecurity events occur, the cybersecurity team focuses on responding to and containing the threat and minimizing impact. In the event of an incident, the cybersecurity team assesses, among other factors, safety impact, supply chain and manufacturing disruption, data and personal information loss, business operations disruption, projected cost and potential for reputational harm, with participation from technical, legal and law enforcement support, as appropriate.\n\nWe have implemented a cybersecurity awareness program which covers topics such as phishing, social networking safety, password security and mobile device usage. We have mandatory training in the areas of cybersecurity, privacy, and confidential information handling.  We also conduct regular phishing training and simulations for our employees and contractors. We provide extensive specialized role-based training to technical professionals in cybersecurity, secure application development, and other focus areas. We also conduct periodic tabletop exercises to validate our preparation for cyber events.\n\nWe operate a third-party cybersecurity program with the goal of minimizing disruption to the Company's business and production operations, strengthening supply chain resilience, and supporting the integrity of components and systems used in its products and services. We rely heavily on our supply chain to deliver our products and services to our customers, and a cybersecurity incident at a supplier, subcontractor or joint venture partner could materially adversely impact us. We assess  third-party  cybersecurity  controls  through  a  cybersecurity  third-party  risk  assessment  process.  Identified  deficiencies  are  addressed  through  a  risk remediation process. For select suppliers, we engage third-party cybersecurity monitoring and alerting services, and seek to work directly with those suppliers to address potential deficiencies identified.\n\nAs of the date of this report, we do not believe that risks from any cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. That said, as discussed more fully under Item 1A. 'Risk Factors-Operational Risks- Increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services' of this Form 10-K, these threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Cybersecurity attacks could also include attacks targeting customer data or the security, integrity and/or reliability of the hardware and software installed  in  our  products.  It  is  possible  that  our  information  technology  systems  and  networks,  or  those  managed  or  provided  by  third  parties,  could  have vulnerabilities, which could go unnoticed for a period of time. While various procedures and controls have been and are being utilized to mitigate such risks, there can be no guarantee that the actions and controls we have implemented and are implementing, or which we cause or have caused third-party service providers to implement, will be sufficient to protect and mitigate associated risks to our systems, information or other property.\n\n## Cybersecurity Governance\n\nCaterpillar's board has oversight for risk management with a focus on the most significant risks facing the Company, including strategic, operational, financial and legal compliance risks. The board's risk oversight process builds upon management's risk assessment and mitigation processes, which include an enterprise risk management program of which our cybersecurity processes are an integral component.",

Moreover, we continue to work with the DoD on assessing cybersecurity risk and on policies and practices aimed at mitigating these risks. For ex ample, we have worked in collaboration with the other members of the defense industrial base to support DoD's development of the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) program, DoD's program to ensure members of the defense industrial base meet cybersecurity requirements for handling CUI and federal contract information. We believe we are well positioned to meet the requirements of the CMMC and are preparing for certification. In addition to following DoD guidance and implementing pre-existing third party frameworks, we have developed our own practices and frameworks, which we believe enhance our ability to identify and manage cybersecurity risks. For example, we use a proactive risk management strategy that we developed and implemented called the Intelligence Driven Defense model that seeks to identify and prevent cybersecurity incidents by understanding the nature of adversaries and using this information to minimize the impact of an attack. \u00ae\n\nThird parties also play a role in our cybersecurity. We engage third-party services to conduct evaluations of our security controls, whether through penetration testing,  independent  audits  or  consulting  on  best  practices  to  address  new  challenges.  These  evaluations  include  testing  both  the  design  and  operational effectiveness of security controls. We also share and receive threat intelligence with our defense industrial base peers, government agencies, information sharing and analysis centers and cybersecurity associations.\n\nWe rely heavily on our supply chain to deliver our products and services to our customers, and a cybersecurity incident at a supplier, subcontractor, joint venture partner, or service provider could materially adversely impact us. We assess third party cybersecurity controls through a cybersecurity questionnaire and include security and privacy addendums to our contracts where applicable. We also contractually flow cybersecurity regulatory requirements to our subcontractors as required by the DFARS and other government agency specific requirements. These contractual flow downs include the requirement that our subcontractors implement certain security controls, and that our subcontractors self-report the status of their implementation of these controls to the  U.S.  G overnment.  These government contracting regulations may create challenges for our supply chain and increase costs. We also require that our subcontractors report cybersecurity incidents to us so that we can assess the impact of the incident on us. For select suppliers, we engage third-party cybersecurity monitoring and alerting services, and seek to work directly with those suppliers to address potential deficiencies identified. We also make available cybersecurity education and awareness materials and briefings to our suppliers.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Board of Directors oversees management's processes for identifying and mitigating risks, including cybersecurity risks, to help align our risk exposure with our strategic objectives. Senior leadership, including our Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), regularly briefs the Board of Directors on our cybersecurity and information  security  posture  and  the  Board  of  Directors  is  apprised  of  cybersecurity  incidents  deemed  to  have  a  moderate  or  higher  business  impact,  even  if immaterial to us. The Classified Business and Security Committee of the Board of Directors is briefed by senior leadership, as appropriate, on the cybersecurity of classified  programs  and  the  security  of  our  classified  business  supply  chain.  Other  than  oversight  of  classified  business  cybersecurity,  the  full  Board  retains oversight of cybersecurity because of its importance to Lockheed Martin and the heightened risk in the aerospace and defense industry. In the event of an incident, we intend to follow our detailed incident response playbook, which outlines the steps to be followed from incident detection to mitigation, recovery and notification, including notifying functional areas (e.g., legal), as well as senior leadership, the Board, and regulators, as appropriate.\n\nOur  corporate  information  security  organization,  led  by  our CISO,  is  responsible  for  our  overall  information  security  strategy,  policy,  security  engineering, operations and cyber threat detection and response. The current CISO has extensive information technology and program management experience, and has served many  years  in  our  corporate  information  security  organization.  The  corporate  information  security  organization  manages  and  continually  enhances  a  robust enterprise security structure with the ultimate goal of preventing cybersecurity incidents to the extent feasible, while simultaneously increasing our system resilience in an effort to minimize the business impact should an incident occur. Central to this organization is our computer incident response team (CIRT), which is responsible for the protection, detection and response capabilities used in the defense of Lockheed Martin's data and enterprise computing networks. Employees outside of our corporate information security organization also have a role in our cybersecurity defenses and they are immersed in a corporate culture supportive of security, which we believe improves our cybersecurity.\n\nAssessing, identifying and managing cybersecurity related risks are integrated into our overall enterprise risk management (ERM) process. Cybersecurity related risks are included in the risk universe that the ERM function evaluates to assess top risks to the enterprise on an annual basis. To the extent the ERM process identifies a heightened cybersecurity related risk, risk owners are assigned to develop risk mitigation plans, which are then tracked to completion. The ERM process's annual risk assessment and relevant mitigations are presented to the Board of Directors.\n\nNotwithstanding the extensive approach we take to cybersecurity, we may not be successful in preventing or mitigating a cybersecurity incident that could have a material adverse effect on us.

The company's settlement includes, among other issues, the resolution of disputed tax treatment of profits earned by Caterpillar SARL (CSARL)  from  certain  parts  transactions. We  vigorously  contested  the  IRS's  application  of  the  \"substance-over-form\"  or  \"assignment-of-income\"  judicial doctrines and its proposed increases to tax and imposition of accuracy related penalties. The settlement does not include any increases to tax in the United States based on those judicial doctrines and does not include any penalties. The final tax assessed by the IRS for all issues under the settlement was $490 million for the ten-year period. This amount was primarily paid in 2022 along with associated interest of $250 million.

Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue may make resolving tax disputes more difficult. The final determination of tax  audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax  provisions and accruals. In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax  laws, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, and changes in taxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions may materially adversely impact our tax  ex pense and cash flows.\n\n## Regulatory and Legal Risks\n\n## Increasingly complex and stringent laws, regulations and policies could materially increase our operating costs.\n\nWe are subject to complex and stringent aviation, transportation, environmental, security, labor, employment, safety, privacy, disclosure and data protection and other governmental laws, regulations and policies, both in the U.S. and internationally. In addition, we are impacted by laws, regulations and policies that affect global trade, including tariff and trade policies, ex port requirements, embargoes, sanctions, tax es, monetary policies and other restrictions and charges. Trade discussions and arrangements between the U.S. and various of its trading partners are fluid, and existing and future trade agreements are, and are expected to continue to be, subject to a number of uncertainties, including the imposition of new tariffs or adjustments and changes to the products covered by existing tariffs. The impact of new laws, regulations and policies or decisions or interpretations by authorities applying those laws and regulations, cannot be predicted. Compliance with any new laws, regulations or policies may increase our operating costs or require significant capital ex penditures. Any failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or policies in the U.S. or other countries could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations, which could materially adversely affect us. For ex ample, as previously disclosed, the SEC recently investigated our controls and practices surrounding impairment analyses in connection with the divestiture of UPS Freight in April 2021. On November 22, 2024, we entered into a settlement with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC's findings in connection with alleged violations of Section 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (and related provisions), resolving the investigation. Under the terms of the settlement, we agreed to pay a civil penalty, and agreed to remedial actions, training and process changes.\n\n## Increasingly stringent regulations related to climate change, including reporting obligations, could materially increase our operating costs.\n\nRegulation and required disclosures of greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions and related matters exposes us to potentially significant new taxes, fees, disclosure and compliance obligations and other costs. Compliance with such regulation, and any increased or additional regulation, or the associated costs is further complicated by the fact that various countries and regions may adopt different approaches to climate change regulation and disclosures.\n\nIn the U.S., Congress has considered but, to date, not passed various bills that would regulate GHG emissions. Nevertheless, we believe some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future. Even in the absence of such legislation, the Environmental Protection Agency could determine to regulate GHG emissions, especially aircraft or diesel engine emissions, and this could impose substantial costs on us.\n\nInternational regulations also continue to increase and could materially increase our operating costs. For example, the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, a European regulation, mandates jet fuel suppliers in Europe supply a target percentage of sustainable aviation fuel ('SAF') at airports inside the European Union. The SAF target percentage starts at 2% in 2025 and increases to 70% by 2050. The cost of SAF can be higher than conventional jet fuel, and these suppliers can pass this cost along to purchasers, which can increase our operating costs, potentially significantly. In addition, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (\"CORSIA\"), a global, market-based emissions offset program to encourage carbon-neutral growth began a voluntary pilot phase in 2021, with mandatory participation scheduled to begin in 2027. Details regarding implementation of CORSIA continue to develop, and compliance may increase our operating costs, potentially significantly.\n\nIn addition, in January 2025, the President of the U.S. signed an ex ecutive order indicating that the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris Climate Accords. The effect that the withdrawal may have on future U.S. policy regarding GHG emissions, on CORSIA and on other GHG regulation remains uncertain. The extent to which other countries implement those accords could also have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nIncreased regulation relating to GHG emissions in the U.S. or abroad, especially aircraft, gasoline or diesel engine emissions, could, among other things, increase the cost of fuel and other energy we purchase and the capital costs associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicles prematurely. We cannot predict the impact any future regulation will have on our cost structure or our operating results. It is likely that such regulation could significantly increase our operating costs and",

This highlights the financial and operational risk RTX faces in maintaining export licenses and avoiding penalties. Meanwhile, UPS is subject to global trade laws, including embargoes, sanctions, and tariff policies, which are impacted by fluid U.S. trade agreements and foreign policy shifts. UPS notes that new tariffs or regulatory changes could increase operating costs and require significant capital expenditures. The combination of RTX's direct regulatory enforcement and UPS's exposure to trade policy volatility demonstrates how evolving U.S. foreign policy and sanctions regimes pose both direct compliance penalties and indirect operational cost increases across different industrial sectors.",

Our defense business in particular requires qualified personnel with security clearances due to our classified programs. As portions of our workforce continue to retire and we lose experienced personnel in the future, it is critical that we develop other employees, hire new qualified personnel, and successfully manage the transfer of critical skillsets and industry knowledge within our workforce.\n\nWe have experienced, and continue to experience, challenges hiring highly qualified personnel including engineers, skilled laborers, and security clearance holders. We expect  these  difficulties  to  continue  in  the  future.  In  addition,  the  cost  of  labor  remains  high.  Some  candidates  and  new  personnel  may  have  job-related expectations that differ from our current workforce and are inconsistent with our corporate culture. With respect to existing personnel, some may become required to receive various security clearances and substantial training in order to work on certain programs or perform certain tasks. Necessary security clearances may be delayed, which may impact our ability to perform on our U.S. government contracts. We also may not be successful in training or developing qualified personnel with the requisite relevant skills or security clearances. Moreover, some of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Historically, we have been able to renegotiate expiring agreements without experiencing significant disruptions to business operations. However, the U.S. labor environment has experienced shifts, and if we have additional challenges renegotiating agreements or if our employees pursue new collective representation, then we could experience additional costs and/or be subject to work stoppages. Any of the above factors could seriously harm our business.\n\nMoreover, we believe that a critical element of our ability to successfully attract, train, and retain qualified personnel is our corporate culture, which we believe fosters innovation, collaboration, and a focus on execution, all in an environment of high ethical standards. Our global operations may present challenges in maintaining these important aspects of our corporate culture, and a failure to maintain our corporate culture could negatively impact us. Further, we rely on our key personnel to lead with integrity and to meet our high ethical standards that promote excellent performance. To the extent any of our key personnel were to behave in a way that is inconsistent with our values, including with respect to product safety or quality, legal or regulatory compliance, financial reporting, or people management, we could experience a materially adverse impact to our reputation and our operating results.  In addition, failure or perceived failure to meet stakeholder expectations on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters could harm our reputation and impact demand for our products and services.\n\nExports and imports of certain of our products are subject to various export control, sanctions, and import regulations and may require authorization from regulatory agencies of the U.S. or other countries. We must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export and import of products, services, and technology from and into the U.S. and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations. In the U.S., these laws and regulations include, among others, the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and Arms Export Control Act (AECA) provisions administered by the U.S. Department of State (DOS), embargoes and sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and import regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). Certain of our products, services, and technologies have military or strategic applications and are on the U.S. Munitions List of the ITAR, the Commerce Control List of the EAR, or are otherwise subject to the EAR and/or the U.S. Munitions Import List, and we are required to obtain licenses and authorizations from the appropriate U.S. government agencies before exporting these products out of the  U.S. or importing these products into the  U.S.  U.S. foreign policy or the foreign policy of other licensing jurisdictions may affect the licensing process or otherwise prevent us from engaging in business dealings with certain individuals, entities, or countries. From time to time, we identify, investigate, remediate and voluntarily disclose violations or potential violations of the ITAR and EAR. Any failure by us, our customers, or our suppliers to comply with the above-referenced laws and regulations, arising out of our voluntary disclosures or otherwise, could result in civil or criminal penalties, fines, seizure of our products, adverse publicity, restrictions on our ability to engage in export or import transactions, or the suspension or debarment from doing business with the  U.S.  government.  Moreover,  any  changes  in  export  control,  sanctions,  or  import  regulations  may  further  restrict  the  ex port  or  import  of  our products or services, and the possibility of such changes requires constant monitoring to ensure we remain compliant. Our ability to obtain required licenses and authorizations on a timely basis, or at all, is subject to risks and uncertainties, including changing laws, regulations, or foreign policies, delays in Congressional action, or geopolitical and other factors. If we are not successful in obtaining or maintaining the necessary licenses or authorizations in a timely manner, our sales relating to those approvals may be prevented or delayed, and revenue and profit previously recognized may be reversed. Any restrictions on the export or import of our products or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\n\nIn addition, as previously disclosed, on August 29, 2024, the Company entered into a Consent Agreement (CA) with the DOS to resolve alleged civil violations of the AECA and the ITAR. The CA, which has a three-year term, requires the Company to implement remedial compliance measures and to conduct an external audit of the Company's ITAR compliance program. The",

          "chunk_text": "We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in many jurisdictions. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue may make resolving tax disputes more difficult. The final determination of tax  audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax  provisions and accruals. In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax  laws, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, and changes in taxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions may materially adversely impact our tax  ex pense and cash flows.\n\n## Regulatory and Legal Risks\n\n## Increasingly complex and stringent laws, regulations and policies could materially increase our operating costs.\n\nWe are subject to complex and stringent aviation, transportation, environmental, security, labor, employment, safety, privacy, disclosure and data protection and other governmental laws, regulations and policies, both in the U.S. and internationally. In addition, we are impacted by laws, regulations and policies that affect global trade, including tariff and trade policies, ex port requirements, embargoes, sanctions, tax es, monetary policies and other restrictions and charges. Trade discussions and arrangements between the U.S. and various of its trading partners are fluid, and existing and future trade agreements are, and are expected to continue to be, subject to a number of uncertainties, including the imposition of new tariffs or adjustments and changes to the products covered by existing tariffs. The impact of new laws, regulations and policies or decisions or interpretations by authorities applying those laws and regulations, cannot be predicted. Compliance with any new laws, regulations or policies may increase our operating costs or require significant capital ex penditures. Any failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or policies in the U.S. or other countries could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations, which could materially adversely affect us. For ex ample, as previously disclosed, the SEC recently investigated our controls and practices surrounding impairment analyses in connection with the divestiture of UPS Freight in April 2021. On November 22, 2024, we entered into a settlement with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC's findings in connection with alleged violations of Section 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (and related provisions), resolving the investigation. Under the terms of the settlement, we agreed to pay a civil penalty, and agreed to remedial actions, training and process changes.\n\n## Increasingly stringent regulations related to climate change, including reporting obligations, could materially increase our operating costs.\n\nRegulation and required disclosures of greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions and related matters exposes us to potentially significant new taxes, fees, disclosure and compliance obligations and other costs. Compliance with such regulation, and any increased or additional regulation, or the associated costs is further complicated by the fact that various countries and regions may adopt different approaches to climate change regulation and disclosures.\n\nIn the U.S., Congress has considered but, to date, not passed various bills that would regulate GHG emissions. Nevertheless, we believe some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future. Even in the absence of such legislation, the Environmental Protection Agency could determine to regulate GHG emissions, especially aircraft or diesel engine emissions, and this could impose substantial costs on us.\n\nInternational regulations also continue to increase and could materially increase our operating costs. For example, the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, a European regulation, mandates jet fuel suppliers in Europe supply a target percentage of sustainable aviation fuel ('SAF') at airports inside the European Union. The SAF target percentage starts at 2% in 2025 and increases to 70% by 2050. The cost of SAF can be higher than conventional jet fuel, and these suppliers can pass this cost along to purchasers, which can increase our operating costs, potentially significantly. In addition, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (\"CORSIA\"), a global, market-based emissions offset program to encourage carbon-neutral growth began a voluntary pilot phase in 2021, with mandatory participation scheduled to begin in 2027. Details regarding implementation of CORSIA continue to develop, and compliance may increase our operating costs, potentially significantly.\n\nIn addition, in January 2025, the President of the U.S. signed an ex ecutive order indicating that the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris Climate Accords. The effect that the withdrawal may have on future U.S. policy regarding GHG emissions, on CORSIA and on other GHG regulation remains uncertain. The extent to which other countries implement those accords could also have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nIncreased regulation relating to GHG emissions in the U.S. or abroad, especially aircraft, gasoline or diesel engine emissions, could, among other things, increase the cost of fuel and other energy we purchase and the capital costs associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicles prematurely. We cannot predict the impact any future regulation will have on our cost structure or our operating results. It is likely that such regulation could significantly increase our operating costs and",

      "answer": "Under the Pension Protection Act of 2006, UPS could be required to pay an additional surcharge of 5% to 10% of its existing contributions to multiemployer pension plans if those plans enter critical status. RTX made pension and PRB contributions totaling $0.2 billion in 2023 and is subject to required funding under ERISA rules tied to the Pension Protection Act of 2006, which mandates full funding of U.S. qualified pension plans over a 15-year period.

Net income from continuing operations in 2023 included a $2.2 billion charge related to the Powder Metal Matter, net of tax. The Powder Metal Matter also had the effect of increasing Other accrued liabilities by $2.8 billion in 2023. Utilization of Other accrued liabilities in 2024 related to this matter were $1.0 billion and represent cash paid and credits issued to customers. During 2024, we also paid a combined $1.5 billion related to the Resolution of Certain Legal Matters and the Raytheon Contract Termination.\n\nAdditionally,  a  favorable  impact  from  accounts  receivable  collections,  including  the  related  impact  of  factoring  as  discussed  below ,  and  a  favorable  change  in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities driven by timing of payments and an increase in material purchases, partially offset by the net change in contract assets and contract liabilities, primarily at Pratt &amp; Whitney, due to sales in excess of billings, contributed to an increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities  from  continuing  operations  in  2024  compared  to  2023.  Ex cluding  the  charges  discussed  above,  higher  net  income  from  continuing  operations  after adjustments for depreciation and amortization, deferred income tax benefit, stock compensation cost, net periodic pension and other postretirement income, and gain on sale of business also contributed to an increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily driven by the operating performance of our segments.\n\nThe Company enters into various factoring agreements with third-party financial institutions to sell certain of its receivables. Factoring activity resulted in an increase of $0.1 billion in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations during 2024, compared to a decrease of $0.8 billion in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations during 2023.\n\n## 2023 Compared with 2022 Operating Activities\n\nNet income from continuing operations in 2023 included a $2.2 billion charge related to the Powder Metal Matter, net of tax, which had no effect on cash flow in the period. This charge also had the effect of increasing Other accrued liabilities by $2.8 billion in 2023. Ex cluding the impact of this charge, the favorable change in cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2023 compared to 2022, is primarily driven by higher net income from continuing operations after adjustments for depreciation and amortization, deferred income tax benefit, stock compensation cost, and net periodic pension and other postretirement income. Also contributing to the change in cash flows is a net favorable impact of net contract assets and liabilities due to the timing of collections, a net decrease in tax  payments further discussed below, and lower inventory receipts compared to 2022. These favorable changes were partially offset by higher accounts receivable as a result of increased sales volume and timing of collections and a decrease in factoring.\n\nThe Company enters into various factoring agreements with third-party financial institutions to sell certain of its receivables. Factoring activity resulted in a decrease of $0.8 billion in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations during 2023, compared to an increase of $2.3 billion in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations during 2022. Factoring activity included amounts factored on certain aerospace receivables at the customers' request for which we may be compensated by the customer\n\n## Operating Activities\n\nWe made pension and PRB contributions to trusts of $0.1 billion, $0.2 billion, and $0.1 billion in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Included in the 2023 contributions is a discretionary noncash contribution of $50 million made in RTX common stock to our U.S. qualified pension plans.\n\nWe make both required and discretionary contributions to our pension plans.  Required contributions are primarily determined by Employee  Retirement  Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) funding rules, which require us to fully fund our U.S qualified pension plans over a rolling fifteen-year period as determined annually based on the calculated funded status at the beginning of each year per the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and subsequent amendments. The funding requirements are primarily based on the year's expected service cost and amortization of other previously unfunded liabilities, which are dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of market interest rates, and actuarial assumptions.",

MULTIEMPLOYER EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\n\nWe contribute to a number of multiemployer pension plans under the terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover our union-represented employees. These plans generally provide for retirement, death and/or termination benefits for eligible employees within the applicable collective bargaining units, based on specific eligibility and participation requirements, vesting periods and benefit formulas. The risks of participating in multiemployer plans are different from singleemployer plans in the following respects:\n\n- Assets contributed to a multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers.\n- If we negotiate to cease participating in a multiemployer pension plan, we may be required to pay that plan an amount based on our allocable share of its underfunded status, referred to as a \"withdrawal liability\". However, cessation of participation in a multiemployer plan and subsequent payment of any withdrawal liability is subject to the collective bargaining process.\n- If any of the multiemployer pension plans in which we participate enter critical status, and our contributions are not sufficient to satisfy any rehabilitation plan funding schedule, we could be required under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 to make additional surcharge contributions to the multiemployer pension plan in the amount of five to ten percent of the existing contributions required by our labor agreement. Such surcharges would cease upon the ratification of a new collective bargaining agreement and could not reoccur unless a plan re-entered critical status at a later date.\n\nThe discussion that follows sets forth the impact on our results of operations and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 from our participation in multiemployer pension plans. As part of the overall collective bargaining process for wage and benefit levels, we have agreed to contribute certain amounts to these plans during the contract period. The plans set benefit levels and are responsible for benefit delivery to participants. Future contributions to the plans are determined only through collective bargaining, and we have no additional legal or constructive obligation to increase contributions beyond the agreedupon amounts (except potential surcharges under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 described above).\n\nThe number of employees covered by multiemployer pension plans in 2024 was relatively consistent compared to 2023, but decreased in 2023 relative to 2022 as we reduced union headcount due to lower volume. In each year, contribution rates increased in accordance with the terms of our collective bargaining agreements. There have been no other significant changes that affect the comparability of 2024, 2023 and 2022 contributions. We recognize expense for the contractually-required contributions for each period, and we recognize a liability for any contributions due and unpaid at the end of a reporting period.\n\n## Status of Collective Bargaining Agreements\n\nWe have approximately 314,000 employees in the U.S. employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the IBT. These agreements are scheduled to expire on July 31, 2028.\n\nWe have approximately 10,000 employees in Canada employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the Teamsters which runs through July 31, 2025.\n\nWe have approximately 3,300 pilots who are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the Independent Pilots Association. This collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable September 1, 2025.\n\nWe have approximately 1,900 airline mechanics who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with Teamsters Local 2727 which becomes amendable November 1, 2026. In addition, approximately 3,000 of our auto and maintenance mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the Teamsters are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (\"IAM\"). In July 2024, the IAM ratified a new National Master Agreement that expires on July 31, 2029.",

In contrast, UPS conducts periodic independent third-party assessments of its cybersecurity programs, which are reviewed by the Risk Committee. These assessments provide qualitative and technical insights but do not enforce a standardized compliance framework across third-party vendors. As a result, RTX's structured, regulatory-driven approach may offer more direct protection against cybersecurity-related financial penalties compared to UPS's more flexible, assessment-based model, which relies on internal oversight and may carry a higher risk of regulatory exposure depending on the rigor of selected vendors.",

We evaluate and assign severity levels to incidents, escalate and engage incident response teams based on severity, and manage and mitigate the related risks. Incidents are reported internally  to  members  of  senior  management  and  the  Board  of  Directors  as  appropriate  based  on  severity  and  incident  type  and  are  also  analyzed  for  ex ternal reporting requirements. Our incident management process is designed to coordinate functions to enable continuity of essential business operation in the event of a cyber crisis.\n\nThird-Party Service Providers. We engage third party service providers to expand the capabilities and capacity of our cybersecurity program, including for design, monitoring, and testing of the program's risk prevention and protection measures, and process execution including incident detection, investigation, analysis and response, eradication, and recovery.\n\nManagement of Third-Party Risks. Our suppliers, subcontractors, and other third-party service providers are subject to cybersecurity obligations and controls. We assess and periodically reassess the cybersecurity posture of third-party service providers who store, process, or transmit our information as a service, or connect to our  networks.  We  also  require  our  suppliers,  subcontractors,  and  other  third-party  service  providers  to  agree  to  cybersecurity-related  contractual  terms  and conditions of purchase. Many of these third parties are also subject to regulatory requirements in mandatory government procurement clauses, including those contained in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS). Among other things, mandatory government  procurement  clauses  obligate  adherence  to  a  generally  accepted  cybersecurity  framework,  such  as  NIST,  and  occasional  assessment  of  the implementation of cybersecurity controls as a condition of contract award or during contract performance. Finally, we require these third parties to notify us of cybersecurity incidents that impact us.\n\nProgram Assessment. We continuously evaluate and seek to improve and mature our cybersecurity processes. Our cybersecurity program is regularly assessed through management self-evaluation and ongoing monitoring procedures to evaluate our program effectiveness, including assessments associated with internal controls over financial reporting as well as vulnerability management through active discovery and testing to validate patching and configuration. Additionally, our Internal Audit function regularly assesses our program effectiveness through audits of our systems and processes to help maintain compliance with policies. As cybersecurity threats are continuously evolving, we also periodically engage with third parties to perform maturity assessments of our program to identify potential risk areas and improvement opportunities. This includes assessment of our overall program, policies and processes, compliance with regulatory requirements, and assessment of key vulnerabilities. We use these assessments to supplement our own evaluation of the overall health of our program and target improvement areas. Several external organizations also evaluate our enterprise cybersecurity program, including the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) and Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification Third-Party Assessment Organization. Moreover, some of our products are audited or reviewed for regulatory compliance certification pursuant to the relevant DoD risk management framework.\n\n## Board Oversight and Management's Role\n\nEnterprise Cybersecurity. Our Board of Directors has primary oversight responsibility for enterprise cybersecurity risks. The Special Activities Committee of the Board supports the Board in oversight of classified business cybersecurity, including with respect to Company internal information and operational technology systems. The Audit Committee also considers enterprise cybersecurity risks in connection with its financial and compliance risk oversight role.\n\nOur global chief information security officer (CISO), under the direction of our chief digital officer, leads our enterprise cybersecurity program and is responsible for assessing and managing enterprise cybersecurity risks. Our CISO regularly updates the Board of Directors on cybersecurity risks as they relate to our information and operational technology systems, our suppliers, and other third-party service providers, in addition to updates on enterprise cybersecurity incidents and key Company defenses and mitigation strategies.\n\nOur CISO is an experienced cybersecurity senior executive with more than 25 years' experience building and leading cybersecurity, risk management, and IT teams. In performing his role, he regularly reviews enterprise cybersecurity risks, controls, program policy, and processes, including training, oversees policy and program development, implementation and updates, and informs senior leadership on cybersecurity-related issues and activities affecting  the  organization.  Our  CISO  is regularly apprised of enterprise cybersecurity events, threats, and activities, including with respect to incidents, protection vulnerabilities, software update needs, and lifecycle status.\n\nProduct and Services Cybersecurity. The Special Activities Committee of our Board of Directors has primary oversight responsibility for cybersecurity risks related to  our  products  and  services.  The  full  Board  of  Directors  also  receives  periodic  briefings  from  management  regarding  the  Company's  products  and  services cybersecurity risks. The Audit Committee also considers product and services cybersecurity risks in connection with its financial and compliance risk oversight role.",

The Risk Committee regularly updates the Board on these activities.\n\nThe Risk Committee oversees the Company's approach to cybersecurity risk assessment and mitigation by, among other things, (i) reviewing the Company's cybersecurity insurance program, (ii) reviewing the Company's cybersecurity budget, (iii) discussing the results of various internal cybersecurity audits and periodic independent third-party assessments of the Company's cybersecurity programs, (iv) being briefed on cybersecurity matters by outside experts, and (v) receiving regular updates from the Company's Chief Information Security Officer ('CISO') and others on cybersecurity risks, operational metrics, compliance and regulatory developments, training programs, risk mitigation activities, key projects and industry developments. The Company's Chief Legal and Compliance Officer (\"CLCO\"), Chief Digital and Technology Officer (\"CDTO\"), CISO and Vice President of Compliance and Internal Audit participate in Risk Committee meetings and meet individually with the Risk Committee on a periodic basis to discuss and address relevant matters, including the Company's approach to cybersecurity risk assessment and mitigation. The CISO reports to the CDTO, who in turn reports to the Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\"). The CISO has more than thirty years of IT experience, has served many years in various information security management roles and has multiple cybersecurity certifications.\n\nThe Company maintains an enterprise risk management process designed to identify potential events that may affect the achievement of the Company's objectives or have a material adverse effect on the Company. Cybersecurity is among the risks considered as a part of this process. The Company's management, including the CISO, also participates on the Company's Information Security &amp; Privacy Governance Council ('ISPGC'). The ISPGC meets periodically to consider information security and privacy matters.\n\nThe Company utilizes various technical and qualitative processes to assist in identifying, assessing and managing cybersecurity risks. The Company's processes include periodic discussions and risk reviews with management. These processes also include, depending on facts and circumstances, internal audits, third-party assessments, post-remediation reviews, engagements with independent third-party service providers and key governmental agencies, regular employee training, an incident response plan and backup and recovery plans. Our periodic engagements with independent third-party service providers are designed to provide qualitative and technical cybersecurity assessments. The Company has a corporate-level cybersecurity team, led by the CISO, that, among other responsibilities, receives and reviews reports regarding potential threats, trends and remediation strategies. The cybersecurity team evaluates threat intelligence and information obtained from various sources, including internal, public or private sources, government agencies and external consultants. Certain of the Company's subsidiaries have separate cybersecurity teams that, along with the corporate-level cybersecurity team, play a role in the Company's efforts to monitor, identify, assess and manage cybersecurity risks.\n\nThe Company interacts with the information technology networks and systems of third parties for many aspects of our business. We consider and evaluate cybersecurity risks associated with the use of independent third-party service providers. To help UPS understand and mitigate potential cybersecurity risks related to third parties, we generally utilize measures such as vendor risk assessments, periodic technical assessments of third-party vendors' controls and contracts governing the use of and access to our data and compliance with our security requirements.\n\nWe maintain an Incident Response Plan that includes processes and procedures for reviewing and responding to cybersecurity incidents. We periodically test our readiness to respond to a cybersecurity incident through various scenario-based drills. The Incident Response Plan includes processes for escalation to the CISO, the Executive Leadership Team, including the CEO, the Risk Committee and the Board, and a process for consideration of whether a cybersecurity incident is material and may require disclosure in SEC filings.\n\nFor additional information on cybersecurity risks and the impact they may have on our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition see \"Risk Factors - Business and Operating Risks - A significant cybersecurity incident, or increased data protection regulations, could materially adversely affect us\".",

      "answer": "RTX explicitly discloses that all derivative contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges will mature by May 2036, showing a defined timeline for their interest rate risk management. In contrast, UPS mentions exposure to floating-rate long-term debt and the use of derivative instruments to mitigate interest rate risks, but does not disclose specific maturity dates for these hedging instruments. Therefore, RTX provides a concrete endpoint (May 2036) for its hedging strategy, while UPS's approach lacks this level of specificity.",

We are subject to many laws governing our international operations, including those that prohibit improper payments to government officials and commercial customers, govern our environmental impact or labor matters, restrict where we can do business, regulate our shipments to certain countries and limit information that we can provide to non-U.S. governments. Our failure to manage and anticipate these and other risks associated with our international operations could materially adversely affect us.\n\n## Our inability to effectively integrate any acquired businesses and realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic alliances could materially adversely affect us.\n\nFrom time to time we acquire businesses, form joint ventures and enter into strategic alliances. Whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends, in part, upon successful integration between the businesses involved, the performance of the underlying operations, capabilities or technologies and the management of the acquired operations. Accordingly, our financial results could be materially adversely affected by our failure to effectively integrate acquired operations, unanticipated performance or other issues or transaction-related charges.\n\n## Financial Risks\n\n## Changing fuel and energy prices, including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, and interruptions in supplies of these commodities could materially adversely affect us.\n\nFuel and energy costs have a significant impact on our operations. We require significant quantities of fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles and are exposed to the risks associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. We seek to mitigate our ex posure to changing fuel prices through our pricing strategy and have in the past and may in the future utilize hedging transactions. There can be no assurance that this strategy will be effective. If we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharges, higher fuel costs could materially adversely impact our operating results. Even if we are able to offset changes in fuel costs with surcharges, high fuel surcharges have in the past, and may in the future result in a shift from our higher-yielding products to lower-yielding products or an overall reduction in volume, revenue and profitability. Moreover, we could experience a disruption in energy supplies as a result of new or increased regulation, war or other conflicts, weather-related events or natural disasters, actions by producers (including as part of their own sustainability efforts) or other factors beyond our control, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\n## Changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates may have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nWe conduct business in a number of countries, with a significant portion of our revenue derived from operations outside the United States. Our international operations are affected by changes in the exchange rates for local currencies, in particular the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Chinese Renminbi and Hong Kong Dollar.\n\nWe are exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily on our short-term debt and that portion of our long-term debt that carries floating interest rates. Additionally, changes in interest rates impact the valuation of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and the related costs recognized in the statements of consolidated income. The impact of changes in interest rates on our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and costs, and on our debt, is discussed further in Part I, \"Item 7 - Critical Accounting Estimates,\" and Part II, \"Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\", respectively, of this report.\n\nWe monitor and manage foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate exposures, and use derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of changes in these rates on our financial condition and results of operations; however, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates cannot always be predicted or effectively hedged, and may have a material adverse effect on us.\n\n## Our business requires significant capital and other investments; if we do not accurately forecast our future investment needs, we could be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur business requires significant capital investments, including in aircraft, vehicles, technology, facilities and sortation and other equipment. In addition to forecasting our capital investment requirements, we adjust other elements of our operations and cost structure in response to economic and regulatory conditions. These investments support both our existing business and anticipated growth. Forecasting amounts, types and timing of investments involves many factors which are subject to uncertainty and may be beyond our control, such as technological changes, general economic trends, revenues, profitability, changes in governmental regulation and competition. If we do not accurately forecast our future capital investment needs, we could under- or over-invest, or have excess capacity or insufficient capacity, any of which could negatively affect our revenues and profitability.",

      "answer": "General Dynamics faces environmental liabilities at third-party sites where it has been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP), but expects a significant percentage of the remediation costs to remain allowable contract costs, and therefore recoverable under U.S. government contracts. This cost recovery mechanism reduces the net financial risk to GD. In contrast, Union Pacific faces obligations for investigation, remediation, and monitoring at existing and future sites related to its railroad operations, with no indication of similar cost recovery mechanisms. UNP acknowledges that actual costs may vary from estimates due to regulatory changes, technological shifts, and third-party participation, and that these liabilities could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and liquidity. Therefore, while both companies face material environmental risk exposure, GD's ability to recover costs under federal contracts provides a financial buffer not explicitly available to UNP.",

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\n\n## Litigation\n\nIn  2015,  Electric  Boat  Corporation,  a  subsidiary  of  General  Dynamics  Corporation,  received  a  Civil Investigative Demand from the U.S. Department of Justice regarding an investigation of potential False Claims Act  violations  relating  to  alleged  failures  of  Electric  Boat's  quality  system  with  respect  to  allegedly  nonconforming parts purchased from a supplier. In 2016, Electric Boat was made aware that it is a defendant in a lawsuit related to this matter which had been filed under seal in U.S. district court. Also in 2016, the Suspending and  Debarring  Official  for  the  U.S.  Department  of  the  Navy  issued  a  Show  Cause  Letter  to  Electric  Boat requesting  that  Electric  Boat  respond  to  the  official's  concerns  regarding  Electric  Boat's  oversight  and management  with  respect  to  its  quality  assurance  systems  for  subcontractors  and  suppliers.  Electric  Boat responded to the Show Cause Letter and engaged in discussions with the U.S. government.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2019, the Department of Justice declined to intervene in the qui tam action, noting that its investigation continues, and the court unsealed the relator's complaint. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the relator  filed  a  second  amended  complaint.  In  the  third  quarter  of  2021,  the  court  dismissed  the  relator's complaint with prejudice. The relator has appealed the dismissal of the complaint to the United States Court of Appeals.  Given  the  current  status  of  these  matters,  we  are  unable  to  express  a  view  regarding  the  ultimate outcome or, if the outcome is adverse, to estimate an amount or range of reasonably possible loss. Depending on the outcome of these matters, there could be a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nAdditionally,  various  other  claims  and  legal  proceedings  incidental  to  the  normal  course  of  business  are pending or threatened against us. These other matters relate to such issues as government investigations and claims, the protection of the environment, asbestos-related claims and employee-related matters. The nature of litigation  is  such  that  we  cannot  predict  the  outcome  of  these  other  matters.  However,  based  on  information currently  available,  we  believe  any  potential  liabilities  in  these  other  proceedings,  individually  or  in  the aggregate, will not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\n## Environmental\n\nWe  are  subject  to  and  affected  by  a  variety  of  federal,  state,  local  and  foreign  environmental  laws  and regulations. We are directly or indirectly involved in environmental investigations or remediation at some of our current  and  former  facilities  and  third-party  sites  that  we  do  not  own  but  where  we  have  been  designated  a potentially  responsible  party  (PRP)  by  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  or  a  state  environmental agency.  Based  on  historical  experience,  we  expect  that  a  significant  percentage  of  the  total  remediation  and compliance  costs  associated  with  these  facilities  will  continue  to  be  allowable  contract  costs  and,  therefore, recoverable under U.S. government contracts.\n\nAs  required,  we  provide  financial  assurance  for  certain  sites  undergoing  or  subject  to  investigation  or remediation.  We  accrue  environmental  costs  when  it  is  probable  that  a  liability  has  been  incurred  and  the amount  can  be  reasonably  estimated.  Where  applicable,  we  seek  insurance  recovery  for  costs  related  to environmental liabilities. We do not record insurance recoveries before collection is considered probable. Based on all known facts and analyses, we do not believe that our liability at any individual site, or in the aggregate, arising from such environmental conditions will be material to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. We also do not believe that the range of reasonably possible additional loss beyond what has been recorded would be material to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe Are Subject to Significant Environmental Laws and Regulations - Due to the nature of the railroad business, our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air; discharges to waters; handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of waste and other  materials;  and  hazardous  material  or  petroleum  releases.  We  generate  and  transport  hazardous  and  nonhazardous waste in our operations. Environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties, leased properties, properties owned by third-parties, as well as properties we currently own. Environmental liabilities have  arisen  and  may  also  arise  from  claims  asserted  by  adjacent  landowners  or  other  third-parties  in  toxic  tort litigation. We have been and may be subject to allegations or findings that we have violated, or are strictly liable under,  these  laws  or  regulations.  We  currently  have  certain  obligations  at  existing  sites  for  investigation, remediation,  and  monitoring,  and  we  likely  will  have  obligations  at  other  sites  in  the  future.  Liabilities  for  these obligations  affect  our  estimate  based  on  our  experience  and,  as  necessary,  the  advice  and  assistance  of  our consultants.  However,  actual  costs  may  vary  from  our  estimates  due  to  any  or  all  of  several  factors,  including changes to environmental laws or interpretations of such laws, technological changes affecting investigations and remediation,  the  participation  and  financial  viability  of  other  parties  responsible  for  any  such  liability,  and  the corrective action or change to corrective actions required to remediate any existing or future sites. We could incur significant  costs  as  a  result  of  any  of  the  foregoing,  and  we  may  be  required  to  incur  significant  expenses  to investigate  and  remediate  known,  unknown,  or  future  environmental  contamination,  which  could  have  a  material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\n\n## Macroeconomic and Industry Risks\n\nWe Face Competition from Other Railroads and Other Transportation Providers - We face competition from other railroads, motor carriers, ships, barges, and pipelines. Our main railroad competitor is Burlington Northern Santa Fe LLC. Its primary subsidiary, BNSF Railway Company (BNSF), operates parallel routes in many of our main traffic corridors. In addition, we operate in corridors served by other railroads and motor carriers. Motor carrier competition exists for all three of our commodity groups (excluding most coal shipments). Because of the proximity of our routes to  major  inland  and  Gulf  Coast  waterways,  barges  can  be  particularly  competitive,  especially  for  grain  and  bulk commodities in certain areas where we operate. In addition to price competition, we face competition with respect to transit times, quality, and reliability of service from motor carriers and other railroads. Motor carriers in particular can have an advantage over railroads with respect to transit times and timeliness of service. However, railroads are much more fuel-efficient than trucks, which reduces the impact of transporting goods on the environment and public infrastructure, and we have been making efforts to convert truck traffic to rail. Additionally, we must build or acquire and  maintain  our  rail  system,  while  trucks,  barges,  and  maritime  operators  are  able  to  use  public  rights-of-way maintained  by  public  entities.  Any  of  the  following  could  also  affect  the  competitiveness  of  our  transportation services for some or all of our commodities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity: (i) improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the costs of these alternative modes of transportation, such as autonomous or more fuel efficient trucks, (ii) legislation that eliminates or significantly increases the size or weight limitations applied to motor carriers, or (iii) legislation or regulatory changes that impose operating restrictions on railroads or that adversely affect the profitability of some or all railroad traffic. Many movements face product or geographic competition where our customers can use different products (e.g., natural gas instead of coal, sorghum instead of corn) or commodities from different locations (e.g., grain from states or countries that we do not serve, crude oil from different regions). Sourcing different commodities or different locations allows shippers to substitute different carriers and such competition may reduce our volume or constrain  prices. Additionally,  any  future  consolidation  of  the  rail  industry  could  materially  affect  our  competitive environment.\n\nWe  May  Be  Affected  by  Climate  Change  and  Market  or  Regulatory  Responses  to  Climate  Change -  Climate change, including the impact of global warming, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Restrictions, caps, taxes, or other controls on emissions of GHGs, including diesel exhaust, could significantly increase our operating costs. Restrictions on emissions could also affect our customers that  (a)  use  commodities that we carry to produce energy, (b) use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering  the  commodities  we  carry,  or  (c)  manufacture  or  produce  goods  that  consume  significant  amounts  of energy or burn fossil fuels, including chemical producers, farmers and food producers, and automakers and other manufacturers. Significant cost increases, government regulation, or changes of consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy, emissions reductions, and GHG emissions could materially affect the markets for the commodities we carry and demand for our services, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Government incentives encouraging the use of alternative  sources  of  energy  also  could  affect  certain  of  our  customers  and  the  markets  for  certain  of  the commodities  we  carry  in  an  unpredictable  manner  that  could  alter  our  traffic  patterns,  including,  for  example, increasing royalties charged to producers of PRB coal by the U.S. Department of Interior and the impacts of ethanol incentives  on  farming  and  ethanol  producers.  We  could  face  increased  costs  related  to  defending  and  resolving legal  claims  and  other  litigation  related  to  climate  change  and  the  alleged  impact  of  our  operations  on  climate change.  Violent  weather  caused  by  climate  change,  including  earthquakes,  hurricanes,  fires,  floods,  extreme temperatures,  avalanches,  and  significant  precipitation  could  cause  line  outages  and  other  interruptions  to  our infrastructure.  Any  of  these  factors,  individually  or  in  operation  with  one  or  more  of  the  other  factors,  or  other unforeseen impacts of climate change could reduce the amount of traffic we handle and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. While we work to implement our Climate Action Plan, our efforts to achieve emission reduction targets could significantly increase our operational costs and capital expenditures.",

In contrast, Union Pacific's environmental liability is subject to uncertainties such as the nature and volume of contamination, the financial viability of other potentially responsible parties, and evolving remediation techniques, with no explicit mention of contractual cost recovery mechanisms.

Also in 2016, the Suspending and  Debarring  Official  for  the  U.S.  Department  of  the  Navy  issued  a  Show  Cause  Letter  to  Electric  Boat requesting  that  Electric  Boat  respond  to  the  official's  concerns  regarding  Electric  Boat's  oversight  and management  with  respect  to  its  quality  assurance  systems  for  subcontractors  and  suppliers.  Electric  Boat responded to the Show Cause Letter and engaged in discussions with the U.S. government.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2019, the Department of Justice declined to intervene in the qui tam action, noting that its investigation continues, and the court unsealed the relator's complaint. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the relator  filed  a  second  amended  complaint.  In  the  third  quarter  of  2021,  the  court  dismissed  the  relator's complaint with prejudice. The relator has appealed the dismissal of the complaint to the United States Court of Appeals.  Given  the  current  status  of  these  matters,  we  are  unable  to  express  a  view  regarding  the  ultimate outcome or, if the outcome is adverse, to estimate an amount or range of reasonably possible loss. Depending on the outcome of these matters, there could be a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nAdditionally,  various  other  claims  and  legal  proceedings  incidental  to  the  normal  course  of  business  are pending or threatened against us. These other matters relate to such issues as government investigations and claims, the protection of the environment, asbestos-related claims and employee-related matters. The nature of litigation  is  such  that  we  cannot  predict  the  outcome  of  these  other  matters.  However,  based  on  information currently  available,  we  believe  any  potential  liabilities  in  these  other  proceedings,  individually  or  in  the aggregate, will not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\n## Environmental\n\nWe  are  subject  to  and  affected  by  a  variety  of  federal,  state,  local  and  foreign  environmental  laws  and regulations. We are directly or indirectly involved in environmental investigations or remediation at some of our current  and  former  facilities  and  third-party  sites  that  we  do  not  own  but  where  we  have  been  designated  a potentially  responsible  party  (PRP)  by  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  or  a  state  environmental agency.  Based  on  historical  experience,  we  expect  that  a  significant  percentage  of  the  total  remediation  and compliance  costs  associated  with  these  facilities  will  continue  to  be  allowable  contract  costs  and,  therefore, recoverable under U.S. government contracts.\n\nAs  required,  we  provide  financial  assurance  for  certain  sites  undergoing  or  subject  to  investigation  or remediation.  We  accrue  environmental  costs  when  it  is  probable  that  a  liability  has  been  incurred  and  the amount  can  be  reasonably  estimated.  Where  applicable,  we  seek  insurance  recovery  for  costs  related  to environmental liabilities. We do not record insurance recoveries before collection is considered probable. Based on all known facts and analyses, we do not believe that our liability at any individual site, or in the aggregate, arising from such environmental conditions will be material to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. We also do not believe that the range of reasonably possible additional loss beyond what has been recorded would be material to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.",

      "question": "What are the implications of GD's classification of real estate funds as Level 3 assets versus UNP's reporting of real estate funds at NAV for the transparency and comparability of their pension asset disclosures?",
      "answer": "GD classifies its real estate funds as Level 3 assets, indicating that their fair value is determined using significant unobservable inputs, which reduces transparency due to the lack of market-based pricing. In contrast, UNP reports its real estate funds at NAV, which reflects the actual net asset value of the underlying investments and is generally more transparent and comparable across periods. This difference in classification and valuation methods makes it more challenging to directly compare the pension asset disclosures of GD and UNP, as GD's Level 3 classification introduces more subjectivity and less market alignment compared to UNP's NAV-based reporting.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - GD classifies real estate funds as Level 3 assets, which are valued using significant unobservable inputs and are not part of the fair value hierarchy when valued at NAV as a practical expedient.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - UNP reports real estate funds at NAV, with a specific value of $48 million listed under 'Plan assets at NAV,' indicating a more direct reflection of the underlying investments' value.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The difference in how GD (Level 3) and UNP (NAV) report their real estate fund investments affects the transparency and comparability of their pension asset disclosures. GD's use of Level 3 introduces more subjectivity, while UNP's NAV approach provides a more objective and comparable measure."

Our  Level  1  assets  include  investments  in  publicly  traded  equity  securities.  These securities are actively traded and valued using quoted prices for identical securities from the market exchanges. Our Level 2 assets include fixed-income securities and commingled funds whose underlying investments are valued using observable marketplace inputs. The fair value of plan assets invested in fixed-income securities is generally determined under a market approach using valuation models that incorporate observable inputs such as  interest  rates,  bond  yields  and  quoted  prices  for  similar  assets.  Our  plan  assets  that  are  invested  in commingled  funds  are  valued  using  a  unit  price  or  net  asset  value  (NA V)  that  is  based  on  the  underlying investments of the fund. Our Level 3 assets consist of insurance deposit contracts, retirement annuity contracts and real estate funds.\n\nCertain investments valued using NAV as a practical expedient are excluded from the fair value hierarchy. These investments are redeemable at NAV generally on a monthly or quarterly basis, and most have redemption notice periods of up to 90 days. The unfunded commitments related to these investments were not material on December 31, 2021 or 2020.\n\nThe fair value of our pension plan assets by investment category and the corresponding level within the fair value hierarchy were as follows:\n\n",

These requirements may necessitate extensive system or operational changes, adversely affecting the cost or attractiveness of the services they offer. Additionally, FedEx highlighted that developing privacy legislation within the U.S. could create limitations or added requirements on the use of personal data by FedEx Dataworks and other FedEx operating companies. UPS, on the other hand, mentioned that compliance with data protection laws, including the EU's General Data Protection Regulation and the California Privacy Rights Act, could expose them to litigation, fines, sanctions, or other penalties. UPS also stated that they expect to continue investing significantly in IT security initiatives, IT risk management, and disaster recovery capabilities to address increasingly frequent and complex cyber threats and regulatory requirements. Both companies face financial risks from these compliance efforts, with FedEx noting potential increases in compliance costs and UPS highlighting the potential for significant additional expenses.",

          "chunk_text": "could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. This regulatory environment is increasingly challenging, based on discretionary factors, and difficult to predict. Consequently, compliance with all applicable regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we do business may present material obligations and risks to our business, including significantly expanded compliance burdens, costs, and enforcement risks; require us to make extensive system or operational changes; or adversely affect the cost or attractiveness of the services we offer. All of these evolving compliance and operational requirements, as well as the uncertain interpretation and enforcement of laws, impose significant costs and regulatory risks that are likely to increase over time. Developing privacy legislation within the U.S. may also create limitations or added requirements on the use of personal data by FedEx Dataworks and the other FedEx operating companies.\n\nThe regulatory environment for global aviation or other transportation rights may affect our operations and increase our operating costs. Our extensive air network is critical to our success. Our right to serve foreign points is subject to the approval of the DOT and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the U.S. and foreign governments. In addition, we must obtain the permission of foreign governments to provide specific flights and services. Our operations outside of the U.S., such as FedEx's international domestic operations, are also subject to current and potential regulations, including certain postal regulations and licensing requirements, that restrict, make difficult, and sometimes prohibit, the ability of foreign-owned companies such as FedEx to compete effectively in parts of the international domestic transportation and logistics market. Regulatory or executive actions affecting global aviation or transportation rights or a failure to obtain or maintain aviation or other transportation rights in important international markets could impair our ability to operate our networks. Further, our ability to obtain or maintain aviation or other transportation rights internationally may be adversely affected by changes in international trade policies and relations. We are subject to other extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that may result in significant costs. For instance, the FAA from time-to-time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require significant ex penditures in order to comply. High-profile accidents, catastrophes, or incidents involving aircraft may trigger increased regulatory and legal compliance requirements. These requirements can be issued with little or no notice, or can otherwise affect our ability to efficiently or fully utilize our aircraft, and in some instances have resulted in the temporary grounding of aircraft types altogether. Further, our business may be adversely affected when government agencies and air traffic control and other systems they oversee cease to operate as expected, including due to partial shutdowns, sequestrations, or similar events. Lapses in government operations may result in, among other things, disruptions in the ability of government agencies to grant required regulatory approvals. For additional discussion, see 'Item 1. Business' of this Annual Report under the caption 'Regulation.'\n\n## We are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including:\n\n-   our ability to mitigate the technological, operational, legal and regulatory, and reputational risks related to autonomous technology and artificial intelligence;\n-     the increasing costs of compliance with federal, state, and foreign governmental agency mandates (including the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act) and defending against inappropriate or unjustified enforcement or other actions by such agencies;\n-     changes in foreign currency ex change rates, especially in the euro, Chinese yuan, British pound, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Mex ican peso, Hong Kong dollar, and Japanese yen, which can affect our sales levels and foreign currency sales prices;\n-     loss or delay in the collection of accounts receivable;\n-     any liability resulting from and the costs of defending against class-action, derivative, and other litigation, such as wage-and-hour, joint employment, securities, vehicle accident, and discrimination and retaliation claims, claims related to our reporting and disclosure of climate change and other ESG topics, and any other legal or governmental proceedings, including the matters discussed in Note 20 of the consolidated financial statements included in 'Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' of this Annual Report;\n-     adverse rulings on appeals and in other future judicial decisions, subsequent adverse jury findings, and changes in judicial precedent;\n-     the sufficiency of insurance coverage we purchase;\n-     the effect of technology developments (including artificial intelligence and machine learning) on our operations and on demand for our services, and our ability to continue to identify and eliminate unnecessary information-technology redundancy and complexity throughout the organization;\n-     disruptions in global supply chains, which can limit the access of FedEx  and our service providers to vehicles and other key capital resources and increase our costs;",

In recent periods, the frequency and sophistication of cyber-attacks have increased and are expected to continue to increase, including as a result of state-sponsored cybersecurity attacks during periods of geopolitical conflict, such as the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. In addition, the rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies may intensify our cybersecurity risks. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate measures to recognize, detect or prevent the occurrence of any of the events described above. In addition, our security processes, protocols and standards may not prove to be sufficient, effective or may not be complied with, either intentionally or inadvertently. To date, we have not experienced a material cybersecurity incident. However, cybersecurity incidents have in the past and may in the future expose us, our customers, employees, franchisees, service providers or others, to loss, disclosure or misuse of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data or result in disruptions to our operations or those of our customers, franchisees, service providers or others. For example, cyber criminals have in the past gained access, and are expected to continue to try to gain access to customer accounts. The type of activity includes fraudulently inserting, diverting and misappropriating items being transported in our network, fraudulently charging shipment fees to customer or franchisee accounts, and fraudulently sending text messages to recipients purporting to be from UPS. The occurrence of any of the events described above could result in material disruptions in our business, the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to our brand and reputation, additional regulatory scrutiny, litigation and other potential material liability. We also may not discover the occurrence of any of the events described above for a significant period of time after the event occurs. Additionally, it may take considerable time for us to investigate and evaluate the full impact of incidents, particularly for sophisticated attacks. These factors may inhibit our ability to provide prompt, full, and reliable information about the incident to our customers, regulators and the public.\n\nWe utilize and interact with the IT networks and systems of third parties for many aspects of our business, including related to our customers, franchisees and service providers such as cloud service providers and third-party delivery services. These third parties have access to information we maintain about our company, operations, customers, employees and vendors, or operating systems that are critical to or can significantly impact our business operations.

Security processes, protocols and standards that we implement and contractual provisions requiring security measures that we impose on such third parties, may not be sufficient or effective at preventing such events or may not be adhered to. These events have in the past and could in the future result in unauthorized access to, or disruptions or denials of access to, misuse or disclosure of, information or systems that are important to us, including proprietary information, sensitive or confidential data, and other information about our operations, customers, employees and suppliers, including personal information.\n\nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in IT security initiatives, IT risk management and disaster recovery capabilities. The costs and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining and enhancing further data or system protection measures could increase significantly to overcome increasingly frequent, complex and sophisticated cyber threats and regulatory requirements.\n\nIn addition, our customers' confidence in our ability to protect data and systems and to provide services consistent with their expectations could be impacted, further disrupting our operations. While we maintain cyber insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim.\n\nAlthough to date we are unaware of any material data breach or cybersecurity incident, including an information system disruption, we cannot provide any assurances that such material events and impacts will not occur in the future. Our efforts to deter, identify, mitigate and/or eliminate future breaches or cybersecurity incidents may require significant additional effort and ex pense and may not be successful.\n\nIn addition, there has recently been heightened regulatory and enforcement focus relating to the collection, use, retention, transfer, and processing of personal data in the U.S. (at both the state and federal level) and internationally, including the EU's G eneral Data Protection Regulation, the California Privacy Rights Act, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, and other similar laws that have been or are expected to be enacted by other jurisdictions. In addition, China and certain other jurisdictions have enacted more stringent data localization requirements. An actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable data protection laws, regulations, or other data protection standards has in the past and may in the future expose us to litigation, fines, sanctions, or other penalties, which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

      "answer": "FedEx faces risks in achieving its 2040 carbon neutrality goal due to uncertainties around acquiring alternative fuel vehicles, sustainable fuels, and fuel-efficient aircraft at scale, which could result in fluctuating annual costs from carbon offset purchases and significant capital expenditures. Meanwhile, UPS is directly impacted by ReFuelEU Aviation, which mandates that suppliers provide 70% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2050, starting at 2% in 2025. Since SAF is currently more expensive than conventional jet fuel, UPS will likely face rising fuel costs that could pressure operating margins unless offset by efficiency gains or pricing power. Both companies are also subject to CORSIA, a global offset program that begins mandatory participation in 2027, adding further compliance costs. These dual regulatory pressures require both firms to make strategic capital allocation decisions\u2014FedEx must weigh investments in electrification, aircraft modernization, and carbon offsets, while UPS must manage the escalating cost of SAF and CORSIA compliance\u2014potentially affecting long-term profitability, investment in growth initiatives, and shareholder returns.",

Business' of this Annual Report under the caption 'Regulation.'\n\nWe may also incur additional expenses as a result of U.S. and international regulators requiring additional disclosures regarding GHG emissions and other environmental matters including, but not limited to, the European Sustainability Reporting Standards and Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and the final rules adopted by the SEC in March 2024. Furthermore, many countries and U.S. states in which we operate or are subject to regulation have adopted, or are expected to adopt, additional requirements related to the disclosure of GHG emission and related matters. In many cases these requirements differ and may conflict from country to country, increasing our costs or requiring significant management time and attention. Additionally, we could be subject to climate litigation or regulatory enforcement actions, as groups, individuals, and governmental authorities affected by climate change seek to recover climate-related damages from entities they perceive as being partially responsible for human-induced climate change because of the emission of GHGs from their operations.\n\nMoreover, even without such regulation, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the GHGs emitted by companies in the airline and transportation industries could harm our reputation, reduce customer demand for our services, especially our air express services, and increase our liability. Finally, given the broad and global scope of our operations and our susceptibility to global macroeconomic trends, we are particularly vulnerable to the physical risks of climate change that could affect all of humankind, such as shifts in weather patterns and world ecosystems.\n\nWe may be unable to achieve or demonstrate progress on our goal of carbon neutrality for our global operations by calendar 2040. In 2021, we announced a goal to achieve carbon neutrality for our global operations by calendar 2040. Achievement of this goal depends on our execution of operational strategies relating to vehicle electrification; sustainable fuel procurement; fuel conservation and aircraft modernization; facilities; sustainable customer solutions; and potentially voluntary carbon offset credits.\n\nExecution of these strategies, as well as demonstrable progress on and achievement of our calendar 2040 goal, is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. See 'The Environment' under 'Item 1. Business' of this Annual Report for information on our review of our previously disclosed Federal Express pickup-and-delivery purchase goals. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our ability to successfully implement our business strategy, effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and achieve the anticipated benefits and associated cost savings of such strategies and actions; the availability and cost of, and our ability to acquire, alternative fuel vehicles, alternative fuels, fuel-efficient aircraft, global electrical charging infrastructure and requisite power grid capacity, off-site renewable energy, and other materials and components, many of which are not presently in existence or available at scale to meet the required global and regulatory demand creating intense competition that may significantly increase the costs; unforeseen production, design, operational, and technological difficulties; the outcome of research efforts and future technology developments, including the ability to scale projects and technologies on a commercially competitive basis such as carbon sequestration and/or other related processes; compliance with, and changes or additions to, global and regional regulations, taxes, charges, mandates, or requirements relating to GHG emissions, carbon costs, or climate-related goals; labor-related regulations and requirements that restrict or prohibit our ability to impose requirements on third parties who provide contracted transportation for our transportation networks; the availability of incentives to enhance the production and affordability of alternative fuel vehicles, alternative fuels, global electrical charging infrastructure and requisite power grid capacity, and other materials and components; adapting products to customer preferences and customer acceptance of sustainable supply chain solutions and potentially increased prices for our services; and the actions of competitors and competitive pressures. Purchase of carbon offset credits to meet our 2040 carbon neutrality goal could add significant fluctuating annualized costs due to the uncertain price of carbon and any voluntary or regulatory schemes to offset emissions, lead to increased regulatory attention, and inhibit the development of other carbon reduction approaches that we may otherwise pursue. There also is a risk that any voluntary carbon offset credits purchased, even if accepted by regulators, could be viewed by third parties as not sufficiently reflecting real, verifiable, and additional G HG  reductions, leading to reputational harm.\n\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute our strategies and achieve or demonstrate progress on our calendar 2040 goal of carbon neutrality for our global operations. Additionally, we may determine that it is in our best interests to prioritize other business, social, governance, or sustainable investments and/or initiatives (such as our DRIVE transformation program, including Network 2.0) over the achievement of our calendar 2040 goal based on economic, regulatory, or social factors, business strategy, or other reasons. Failure to achieve or demonstrate progress on our calendar 2040 goal could damage our reputation and customer and other stakeholder relationships. Further, given investors' and other stakeholders' increased focus related to ESG matters, such a failure could cause large stockholders to reduce their ownership of FedEx common stock and limit our access to financing. Such conditions could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as on the price of our common stock.\n\nOur inability to quickly and effectively restore operations following adverse weather or a localized disaster or disturbance in a key geography could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue may make resolving tax disputes more difficult. The final determination of tax  audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax  provisions and accruals. In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax  laws, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, and changes in taxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions may materially adversely impact our tax  ex pense and cash flows.\n\n## Regulatory and Legal Risks\n\n## Increasingly complex and stringent laws, regulations and policies could materially increase our operating costs.\n\nWe are subject to complex and stringent aviation, transportation, environmental, security, labor, employment, safety, privacy, disclosure and data protection and other governmental laws, regulations and policies, both in the U.S. and internationally. In addition, we are impacted by laws, regulations and policies that affect global trade, including tariff and trade policies, ex port requirements, embargoes, sanctions, tax es, monetary policies and other restrictions and charges. Trade discussions and arrangements between the U.S. and various of its trading partners are fluid, and existing and future trade agreements are, and are expected to continue to be, subject to a number of uncertainties, including the imposition of new tariffs or adjustments and changes to the products covered by existing tariffs. The impact of new laws, regulations and policies or decisions or interpretations by authorities applying those laws and regulations, cannot be predicted. Compliance with any new laws, regulations or policies may increase our operating costs or require significant capital ex penditures. Any failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or policies in the U.S. or other countries could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations, which could materially adversely affect us. For ex ample, as previously disclosed, the SEC recently investigated our controls and practices surrounding impairment analyses in connection with the divestiture of UPS Freight in April 2021. On November 22, 2024, we entered into a settlement with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC's findings in connection with alleged violations of Section 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (and related provisions), resolving the investigation. Under the terms of the settlement, we agreed to pay a civil penalty, and agreed to remedial actions, training and process changes.\n\n## Increasingly stringent regulations related to climate change, including reporting obligations, could materially increase our operating costs.\n\nRegulation and required disclosures of greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions and related matters exposes us to potentially significant new taxes, fees, disclosure and compliance obligations and other costs. Compliance with such regulation, and any increased or additional regulation, or the associated costs is further complicated by the fact that various countries and regions may adopt different approaches to climate change regulation and disclosures.\n\nIn the U.S., Congress has considered but, to date, not passed various bills that would regulate GHG emissions. Nevertheless, we believe some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future. Even in the absence of such legislation, the Environmental Protection Agency could determine to regulate GHG emissions, especially aircraft or diesel engine emissions, and this could impose substantial costs on us.\n\nInternational regulations also continue to increase and could materially increase our operating costs. For example, the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, a European regulation, mandates jet fuel suppliers in Europe supply a target percentage of sustainable aviation fuel ('SAF') at airports inside the European Union. The SAF target percentage starts at 2% in 2025 and increases to 70% by 2050. The cost of SAF can be higher than conventional jet fuel, and these suppliers can pass this cost along to purchasers, which can increase our operating costs, potentially significantly. In addition, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (\"CORSIA\"), a global, market-based emissions offset program to encourage carbon-neutral growth began a voluntary pilot phase in 2021, with mandatory participation scheduled to begin in 2027. Details regarding implementation of CORSIA continue to develop, and compliance may increase our operating costs, potentially significantly.\n\nIn addition, in January 2025, the President of the U.S. signed an ex ecutive order indicating that the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris Climate Accords. The effect that the withdrawal may have on future U.S. policy regarding GHG emissions, on CORSIA and on other GHG regulation remains uncertain. The extent to which other countries implement those accords could also have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nIncreased regulation relating to GHG emissions in the U.S. or abroad, especially aircraft, gasoline or diesel engine emissions, could, among other things, increase the cost of fuel and other energy we purchase and the capital costs associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicles prematurely. We cannot predict the impact any future regulation will have on our cost structure or our operating results. It is likely that such regulation could significantly increase our operating costs and",

Risk Factors' of this Annual Report, the U.S. domestic and international package and the U.S. domestic freight and international freight markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service, especially in periods of little or no macroeconomic growth. The ability to compete effectively depends upon price, frequency, reliability, capacity and speed of scheduled service, ability to track packages, extent of geographic coverage, innovative service offerings, and the fit within the customer's overall supply chain.\n\nCompetitors within the U.S. include other package delivery concerns, principally United Parcel Service, Inc. ('UPS'), passenger airlines offering express package services, regional delivery companies, air freight forwarders, and the USPS. Federal Express's principal international competitors are DHL, UPS, DPD (a subsidiary of France's La Poste's GeoPost), General Logistics Systems (a Royal Mail-owned parcel delivery group), foreign postal authorities, passenger airlines, air freight forwarders, regional carriers, and all-cargo airlines. Federal Ex press also competes with startup companies that combine technology with crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs. In addition, some high-volume package shippers, such as Amazon.com, are developing and implementing in-house delivery capabilities and utilizing independent contractors and delivery service providers for deliveries, and may be considered competitors. For example, Amazon.com has established a network of hubs, aircraft, and vehicles and has expressed an intention to offer its internal delivery capabilities broadly to third parties. Many of Federal Ex press's international competitors are government-owned, -controlled, or -subsidized carriers, which may have greater resources, lower costs, less profit sensitivity, and more favorable operating conditions than Federal Express. For more information, see 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' of this Annual Report.\n\n## Employees and Service Providers\n\nRajesh Subramaniam is the President and Chief Executive Officer of Federal Express, John A.

In addition, the carrier must then be granted the permission of such foreign government to provide specific flights and services. The regulatory environment for global aviation rights may from time to time impair the ability of Federal Ex press to operate its air network in the most efficient manner, and efficient operations often utilize open skies provisions of aviation agreements. Additionally, global air cargo carriers, such as Federal Ex press, are subject to current and potential additional aviation security regulation by U.S. and foreign governments.\n\nOur operations outside of the U.S., such as Federal Express's international domestic operations, are also subject to current and potential regulations, including certain postal regulations and licensing requirements, that restrict, make difficult, and sometimes prohibit, the ability of foreign-owned companies such as Federal Express to compete effectively in parts of the international domestic transportation and logistics market.\n\n## Environmental .\n\nNoise : Pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act, the FAA, with the assistance of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ('EPA'), is authorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise. Federal Express's aircraft fleet is in compliance with current FAA noise standards. Although the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 established a National Noise Policy that enables certain airport operators to implement noise abatement programs, it created an opportunity for Federal Express to plan for noise reduction and better respond to local noise constraints. Additionally, certain U.S. airport operators have implemented local noise regulations, and certain foreign jurisdictions impose noise-based limitations on airline operations. Neither the National Noise Policy nor any domestic or foreign local noise regulations have a material effect in any of Federal Ex press's significant markets.\n\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions : Concern over climate change, including the effect of global warming, has led to significant U.S. and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas ('GHG') emissions, including our aircraft and vehicle engine emissions. Increasingly, state and local governments are also considering GHG regulatory requirements. Compliance with such regulation and the associated potential cost is complicated by the fact that various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of climate change. In 2016, the International Civil Aviation Organization ('ICAO') formally adopted a global, market-based emissions offset program known as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation ('CORSIA'). This program established a goal for the aviation industry to achieve carbon neutral growth in international aviation beginning in calendar 2021. Any growth above a global industry emissions baseline would need to be addressed using either eligible carbon offset credits or qualifying sustainable aviation fuel purchases. The baseline was originally set as an average of calendar 2019 and calendar 2020 emissions. In 2023, due to the effects of COVID-19 on the airline industry, the ICAO adopted a new baseline of 85% of calendar 2019 emissions. The U.S. has not fully implemented CORSIA to date. In the interim, we continue to voluntarily report our emissions data to the FAA.\n\nOther ICAO member states are moving forward with implementing CORSIA and have taken additional action to reduce aircraft GHG emissions. For example, both the EU and the United Kingdom have implemented regulations to include aviation in the Emissions Trading Scheme ('ETS'). For the EU, under these regulations any airline with flights originating or landing in the European Economic Area ('EEA') is subject to the ETS. Beginning in calendar 2012, airlines including Federal Express were required to purchase emissions allowances or, alternatively, purchase qualifying sustainable aviation fuel if they exceeded the number of free allowances allocated under the ETS. While the current scope of ETS has been limited to apply only to flights within the EEA through calendar 2026, the EU adopted legislation in 2023 requiring that a study be conducted in July 2026 reassessing whether the European Commission should propose to expand the scope of ETS to include international flights from the EEA based on CORSIA implementation and performance.\n\nWe expect compliance with CORSIA and the ETS to increase FedEx operating expenses. The amount of such increase will ultimately depend on a number of factors, including the number of our flights subject to CORSIA and the ETS, the fuel efficiency of our fleet, the average growth of the aviation sector, our ability to utilize sustainable aviation fuels in the future and the price of such fuels, the availability of free allowances (which will be eliminated entirely by the end of calendar 2026), and the price of eligible emission units, offsets, or allowances required to be purchased by FedEx.\n\nAdditionally, in 2017, ICAO adopted new carbon dioxide emissions standards that would apply not only to new aircraft types as of calendar 2020, but also to new deliveries of currently in-production aircraft types from calendar 2023. ICAO established a production cutoff date of January 1, 2028 for aircraft that do not comply with these standards. The standards are considered to be especially stringent for larger aircraft weighing over 60 tons. In 2021, the EPA adopted its own aircraft and aircraft engine GHG emissions standards, which are aligned with the 2017 ICAO emissions standards, and the FAA finalized its own conforming rulemaking to implement the standards through its aircraft certification process which went into effect on April 16, 2024. In the past, the U.S. Congress has also considered bills that would regulate GHG emissions, and some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future. In 2021 the U.S. reentered the Paris climate accord, an agreement among 197 countries to reduce GHG emissions. The effect of the reentry on future U.S. policy regarding GHG emissions and on other GHG regulation is uncertain.",

          "chunk_text": "We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in many jurisdictions. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue may make resolving tax disputes more difficult. The final determination of tax  audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax  provisions and accruals. In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax  laws, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, and changes in taxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions may materially adversely impact our tax  ex pense and cash flows.\n\n## Regulatory and Legal Risks\n\n## Increasingly complex and stringent laws, regulations and policies could materially increase our operating costs.\n\nWe are subject to complex and stringent aviation, transportation, environmental, security, labor, employment, safety, privacy, disclosure and data protection and other governmental laws, regulations and policies, both in the U.S. and internationally. In addition, we are impacted by laws, regulations and policies that affect global trade, including tariff and trade policies, ex port requirements, embargoes, sanctions, tax es, monetary policies and other restrictions and charges. Trade discussions and arrangements between the U.S. and various of its trading partners are fluid, and existing and future trade agreements are, and are expected to continue to be, subject to a number of uncertainties, including the imposition of new tariffs or adjustments and changes to the products covered by existing tariffs. The impact of new laws, regulations and policies or decisions or interpretations by authorities applying those laws and regulations, cannot be predicted. Compliance with any new laws, regulations or policies may increase our operating costs or require significant capital ex penditures. Any failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or policies in the U.S. or other countries could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations, which could materially adversely affect us. For ex ample, as previously disclosed, the SEC recently investigated our controls and practices surrounding impairment analyses in connection with the divestiture of UPS Freight in April 2021. On November 22, 2024, we entered into a settlement with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC's findings in connection with alleged violations of Section 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (and related provisions), resolving the investigation. Under the terms of the settlement, we agreed to pay a civil penalty, and agreed to remedial actions, training and process changes.\n\n## Increasingly stringent regulations related to climate change, including reporting obligations, could materially increase our operating costs.\n\nRegulation and required disclosures of greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions and related matters exposes us to potentially significant new taxes, fees, disclosure and compliance obligations and other costs. Compliance with such regulation, and any increased or additional regulation, or the associated costs is further complicated by the fact that various countries and regions may adopt different approaches to climate change regulation and disclosures.\n\nIn the U.S., Congress has considered but, to date, not passed various bills that would regulate GHG emissions. Nevertheless, we believe some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future. Even in the absence of such legislation, the Environmental Protection Agency could determine to regulate GHG emissions, especially aircraft or diesel engine emissions, and this could impose substantial costs on us.\n\nInternational regulations also continue to increase and could materially increase our operating costs. For example, the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, a European regulation, mandates jet fuel suppliers in Europe supply a target percentage of sustainable aviation fuel ('SAF') at airports inside the European Union. The SAF target percentage starts at 2% in 2025 and increases to 70% by 2050. The cost of SAF can be higher than conventional jet fuel, and these suppliers can pass this cost along to purchasers, which can increase our operating costs, potentially significantly. In addition, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (\"CORSIA\"), a global, market-based emissions offset program to encourage carbon-neutral growth began a voluntary pilot phase in 2021, with mandatory participation scheduled to begin in 2027. Details regarding implementation of CORSIA continue to develop, and compliance may increase our operating costs, potentially significantly.\n\nIn addition, in January 2025, the President of the U.S. signed an ex ecutive order indicating that the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris Climate Accords. The effect that the withdrawal may have on future U.S. policy regarding GHG emissions, on CORSIA and on other GHG regulation remains uncertain. The extent to which other countries implement those accords could also have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nIncreased regulation relating to GHG emissions in the U.S. or abroad, especially aircraft, gasoline or diesel engine emissions, could, among other things, increase the cost of fuel and other energy we purchase and the capital costs associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicles prematurely. We cannot predict the impact any future regulation will have on our cost structure or our operating results. It is likely that such regulation could significantly increase our operating costs and",

      "answer": "UPS's decision to insource final delivery for lightweight residential shipments, which were previously handled by USPS starting in 2024 and fully transitioned in-house beginning January 1, 2025, gives UPS greater control over delivery timelines and service quality. This strategic shift removes a point of indirect competition with FDX, as USPS had been a delivery partner for UPS and a direct competitor to FDX in the lightweight shipment segment. FDX explicitly identifies USPS as a competitor in its 2024 10-K, highlighting sensitivity to price and service in the U.S. domestic package market. By insourcing this service, UPS enhances its vertical integration and service reliability, which could strengthen its competitive position against FDX. This change alters the competitive landscape by reducing USPS's role in the market and intensifying direct competition between FDX and UPS, particularly in the residential delivery segment.",

Risk Factors' of this Annual Report, the U.S. domestic and international package and the U.S. domestic freight and international freight markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service, especially in periods of little or no macroeconomic growth. The ability to compete effectively depends upon price, frequency, reliability, capacity and speed of scheduled service, ability to track packages, extent of geographic coverage, innovative service offerings, and the fit within the customer's overall supply chain.\n\nCompetitors within the U.S. include other package delivery concerns, principally United Parcel Service, Inc. ('UPS'), passenger airlines offering express package services, regional delivery companies, air freight forwarders, and the USPS. Federal Express's principal international competitors are DHL, UPS, DPD (a subsidiary of France's La Poste's GeoPost), General Logistics Systems (a Royal Mail-owned parcel delivery group), foreign postal authorities, passenger airlines, air freight forwarders, regional carriers, and all-cargo airlines. Federal Ex press also competes with startup companies that combine technology with crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs. In addition, some high-volume package shippers, such as Amazon.com, are developing and implementing in-house delivery capabilities and utilizing independent contractors and delivery service providers for deliveries, and may be considered competitors. For example, Amazon.com has established a network of hubs, aircraft, and vehicles and has expressed an intention to offer its internal delivery capabilities broadly to third parties. Many of Federal Ex press's international competitors are government-owned, -controlled, or -subsidized carriers, which may have greater resources, lower costs, less profit sensitivity, and more favorable operating conditions than Federal Express. For more information, see 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' of this Annual Report.\n\n## Employees and Service Providers\n\nRajesh Subramaniam is the President and Chief Executive Officer of Federal Express, John A. Smith is the Chief Operating Officer - United States and Canada, and Richard W. Smith is the Chief Operating Officer - International and Chief Executive Officer - Airline. As of June 7, 2024, Federal Ex press employed approximately 241,000 permanent full-time and approximately 189,000 permanent part-time employees. In addition, Federal Express contracts with approximately 6,000 independent small businesses to conduct certain linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations.\n\nThe pilots at Federal Express, who are a small number of its total employees, are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, International ('ALPA') and are employed under a collective bargaining agreement that took effect in November 2015. The collective bargaining agreement became amendable in November 2021. Bargaining for a successor agreement began in May 2021, and in",

Our  insurance  coverage  may  not  be adequate to cover all the costs related to cybersecurity attacks or disruptions resulting from such events.\n\nOur business may continue to be negatively impacted by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic or other similar outbreaks. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could continue to have, a negative effect on our  business,  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition.  Effects  include  disruptions  or  restrictions  on  our employees' ability to work effectively, temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers, and supply-chain  disruptions,  which  could  affect  our  ability  to  perform  on  our  contracts.  In  addition,  the  U.S. government's  federal  contractor  vaccine  mandate  could  adversely  affect  our  ability,  and  our  subcontractors' ability, to hire and retain highly skilled employees to work on U.S. government programs. Any cost increases that result from these effects may not be fully recoverable on our contracts or adequately covered by insurance, which could impact our profitability. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis that is adversely affecting the economies and financial markets of many countries, which could result in a prolonged economic downturn that may negatively affect demand for our products and services. The imposition of quarantine and travel restrictions has negatively affected and, if reimposed, may continue to negatively affect portions of our business, particularly our Aerospace and Technologies segments. The extent to which COVID19 continues to impact our business, results of operations and financial condition is highly uncertain and will depend  on  future  developments.  Such  developments  may  include  the  geographic  spread  and  duration  of  the virus, including the emergence of new variants, the severity of the disease, vaccination rates and the actions that may be taken by various governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. Other outbreaks of contagious diseases or other adverse public health developments in countries where we operate or our customers are located could similarly affect our business in the future.\n\nIncreased regulation related to global climate change could negatively affect our business. Increased public  awareness  and  concern  regarding  global  climate  change  may  result  in  state,  federal  or  international requirements to reduce or mitigate global warming, such as the imposition of carbon pricing mechanisms or stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions. If environmental or climate-change laws or regulations are adopted or  changed  that  impose  significant  new  costs,  operational  restrictions  or  compliance  requirements  upon  our business or our products, they could increase our capital expenditures, reduce our margins and adversely affect our financial position.\n\n## FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nThis  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  contains  forward-looking  statements  that  are  based  on  management's expectations, estimates, projections and  assumptions.  Words  such  as  'expects,'  'anticipates,' 'plans,' 'believes,' 'scheduled,' 'outlook,' 'estimates,' 'should' and variations of these words and similar expressions are  intended  to  identify  forward-looking  statements.

      "question": "How does the reliance on subcontractors create distinct operational and financial risks for General Dynamics and General Electric, particularly regarding GD's concern over supply chain disruption and GE's exposure to cost overruns in large-scale projects?",
      "answer": "General Dynamics explicitly states that disruption in its supply chain, especially when relying on one or two sources, could adversely impact its ability to meet customer commitments. This highlights a direct operational risk tied to subcontractor availability and reliability. Meanwhile, General Electric notes that performance issues or schedule delays in large-scale projects\u2014often stemming from execution by or coordination with subcontractors\u2014can lead to cost overruns, contractual penalties, and liquidated damages. These risks are particularly pronounced in GE's Renewable Energy and Power businesses, where subcontractor coordination is critical to project success. Therefore, while both companies face operational risks from subcontractor dependencies, GD's risk centers on supply continuity, and GE's risk is more tied to project execution and financial penalties.",

Part  of  our responsibility includes treating all employees with dignity and respect and providing them with fair, marketbased, competitive and equitable compensation. We recognize and reward the performance of our employees in line with our pay-for-performance philosophy and provide a comprehensive suite of benefit options that enables our employees and their dependents to live healthy and productive lives.\n\nSafety  in  our  workplaces  is  paramount.  Across  our  businesses,  we  take  measures  to  prevent  workplace hazards, encourage safe behaviors and enforce a culture of continuous improvement to ensure our processes help reduce incidents and illnesses and comply with governing health and safety laws. These efforts continue to be of the utmost importance as we address the ongoing challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWe are committed to promoting diversity of thought, experience, perspectives, backgrounds and capabilities to drive innovation and strengthen the solutions we deliver to our customers because we believe the results lead to a better outcome. We proudly support a culture of inclusion and encourage a work environment that respects diverse opinions, values individual skills and celebrates the unique experiences our employees bring. We are dedicated to equal employment opportunity that fosters and supports diversity in a principled, productive and inclusive  work  environment. We stand for basic universal human rights, including that employment must be voluntary.  We  track,  measure  and  analyze  our  workforce  trends  to  establish  accountability  for  continuing  to cultivate diverse and inclusive environments across our businesses and at every level of our company.\n\nOur  values  motivate  us  to  promote  strong  workplace  practices  with  opportunities  for  development  and training. Our training and development efforts focus on ensuring that the workforce is appropriately trained on critical  job  skills  as  well  as  leadership  behaviors  that  are  consistent  with  our  ethos.  We  conduct  rigorous succession  planning  exercises  to  ensure  that  key  positions  have  the  appropriate  level  of  bench  strength  to provide for future key positions and leadership transitions. We listen to our workforce to assess areas of concern and levels of engagement.\n\n## 2021 WORKFORCE STATISTICS\n\n- Approximately 85% of our employees are based in the United States, of which roughly 70% are white, 30% are people of color and 20% are veterans of the U.S. armed forces.

          "chunk_text": "Operational execution - Operational challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Company's financial results depend on the successful execution of our businesses' operating plans across all steps of the product and service lifecycle. We continue working to improve the operations and execution of our businesses and our ability to make the desired improvements will be a significant factor in our overall financial performance. We also face operational risks in connection with launching or ramping new product platforms, such as the Haliade-X offshore wind turbine or the Cypress onshore wind turbine at Renewable Energy, or the LEAP engine at Aviation. With significant new product platforms and technologies, our businesses seek to reduce the costs of these products over time with experience, and risks related to our supply chain, product quality, timely delivery or other aspects of operational execution can adversely affect our profit margins or free cash flow. Operational failures at any of our businesses that result in quality problems or potential product, environmental, health or safety risks, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position and results of operations. In addition, a portion of our business, particularly within our Power and Renewable Energy businesses, involves large projects where we take on, or are members of a consortium responsible for, the full scope of engineering, procurement, construction or other services. These types of projects often pose unique risks related to their location, scale, complexity, duration and pricing or payment structure. Performance issues or schedule delays can arise due to inadequate technical expertise, unanticipated project modifications, developments at project sites, environmental, health and safety issues, execution by or coordination with suppliers, subcontractors or consortium partners, financial difficulties of our customers or significant partners or compliance with government regulations, and these can lead to cost overruns, contractual penalties, liquidated damages and other adverse consequences. Where GE is a member of a consortium, we are typically subject to claims based on joint and several liability, and claims can extend to aspects of the project or costs that are not directly related or limited to GE's scope of work or over which GE does not have control. Operational, quality or other issues at large projects, or across our projects portfolio more broadly, can adversely affect GE's business, reputation or results of operations.\n\nProduct safety - Our products and services are highly sophisticated and specialized, and a major failure or similar event affecting our products or third-party products with which our products are integrated can adversely affect our business, reputation, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We produce highly sophisticated products and provide specialized services for both our own and third-party products that incorporate or use complex or leading-edge technology, including both hardware and software. Many of our products and services involve complex industrial machinery or infrastructure projects, such as commercial jet engines, gas turbines, onshore and offshore wind turbines or nuclear power generation, and accordingly the impact of a catastrophic product failure or similar event could be significant. In particular, actual or perceived design or production issues related to new product introductions or relatively new product lines can result in significant reputational harm to our businesses, in addition to direct warranty, maintenance and other costs that may arise. A significant product issue resulting in injuries or death, widespread outages, a fleet grounding or similar systemic consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position and results of operations. In some circumstances, we have and in the future we may continue to incur increased costs, delayed payments or lost equipment or services revenue in connection with a significant issue with a third party's product with which our products are integrated, or if parts or other components that we incorporate in our products have defects or other quality issues. There can be no assurance that the operational processes around product design, manufacture, performance and servicing that we or our customers or other third parties have designed to meet rigorous quality standards will be sufficient to prevent us or our customers or other third parties from experiencing operational process or product failures and other problems, including through manufacturing or design defects, process or other failures of contractors or third-party suppliers, cyber-attacks or other intentional acts, software vulnerabilities or malicious software, that could result in potential product, safety, quality, regulatory or environmental risks.\n\nCybersecurity - Increased cybersecurity requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions, services and data. Increased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats, computer viruses and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks such as ransomware, as well as cybersecurity failures resulting from human error and technological errors, pose a risk to the security of GE's and its customers', partners', suppliers' and third-party service providers' infrastructure, products, systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of GE's and its customers' data. As the perpetrators of such attacks become more capable (including sophisticated state or state-affiliated actors), and as critical infrastructure is increasingly becoming digitized, the risks in this area continue to grow. A significant cyber-related attack in one of our industries, even if such an attack does not involve GE products, services or systems, could pose broader disruptions and adversely affect our business. We have also observed an increase in thirdparty breaches and ransomware attacks at suppliers, service providers and software providers, and our efforts to mitigate adverse effects on GE if this trend continues may be less successful in the future. The increasing degree of interconnectedness between GE and its partners, suppliers and customers also poses a risk to the security of GE's network as well as the larger ecosystem in which GE operates. There can be no assurance that our efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, monitoring and testing, performing security reviews and requiring business partners with connections to the GE network to appropriately secure their information technology systems, and maintenance of protective systems and contingency plans, will be sufficient to prevent, detect and limit the impact of cyber-related attacks, and we remain vulnerable to known or unknown threats. In addition to existing risks, the adoption of new technologies in the future may also increase our exposure to cybersecurity breaches and failures. While we have developed secure development lifecycle design practices to secure our software designs and connected products, an unknown vulnerability or compromise could potentially impact the security of GE's software or connected products and lead to the loss of GE intellectual property, misappropriation of sensitive, confidential or personal data, safety risks or unavailability of equipment. We also have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations or customer-imposed controls. Despite our use of reasonable and appropriate controls to protect our systems and sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, we have vulnerability to security breaches, theft, misplaced, lost or corrupted data, programming errors, employee errors and/or malfeasance (including misappropriation by departing employees) that could potentially lead to material compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems,",

This designation also exposes Union Pacific to potential liabilities at various contaminated sites where it may be named a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or similar laws.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nUnder certain environmental laws, including the United States Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ('CERCLA') and similar state laws, the Company may be jointly and severally liable, sometimes with other potentially responsible parties, for the costs of investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at current or former facilities and at off-site locations where substances designated as 'hazardous substances' have been released or disposed of. The Company has identified numerous locations, many of which are in the United States, at which it may have some liability for remediation of contamination under applicable environmental laws. As a result of the CERCLA designation of PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances in 2024, and to the ex tent EPA finalizes additional proposals related to PFAS, 3M may be required to undertake additional investigative or remediation activities, including where 3M conducts operations or where 3M has disposed of waste. 3M may also face additional litigation from other entities that have liability under these laws for claims seeking contribution for clean-up costs other entities might have.\n\nThe Company has been voluntarily cooperating with various local, state, federal (primarily the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)), and international agencies in their reviews of the environmental and health effects of certain PFAS produced by the Company. 3M currently is defending lawsuits concerning various PFAS-related products and chemistries, and is subject to unasserted and asserted claims and governmental regulatory proceedings and inquiries related to the production and use of PFAS in a variety of jurisdictions, as discussed in Note 19, 'Commitments and Contingencies,' within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 3M has seen increased public and private lawsuits being filed on behalf of states, counties, cities, and utilities alleging, among other things, harm to the general public and damages to natural resources, some of which are pending in the AFFF multi-district litigation and some of which are pending in other jurisdictions. Various factors or developments in these and other disclosed actions could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on 3M. For example, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $897 million, inclusive of legal fees and other related obligations, in the first quarter of 2018 with respect to the settlement of a matter brought by the State of Minnesota involving the presence of PFAS in the groundwater, surface water, fish or other aquatic life, and sediments in the state. In addition, as described in greater detail in Note 19, 'Commitments and Contingencies,' within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in June 2023, the Company entered into a class-action settlement ('PWS Settlement') to resolve a wide range of drinking water claims by public water suppliers in the United States regarding PFAS. The court approved that settlement in March 2024. 3M will pay $10.5 billion to $12.5 billion in total to resolve the claims released by the PWS Settlement, with payments to be made from 2024 through 2036, in exchange for a release of certain claims, as described further in Note 19. Unexpected events related to the PWS Settlement, including the potential impact of the PWS Settlement on other PFAS-related matters, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or consolidated financial position. In addition, as previously disclosed, in connection with the separation of Solventum, the Company agreed to retain liabilities related to PFAS for certain products sold by the Company's health care businesses prior to the separation and by Solventum for a limited period of time following the separation.\n\nGovernmental inquiries, lawsuits, or laws and regulations involving PFAS could lead to the Company incurring liability for damages or other costs, civil or criminal proceedings, the imposition of fines and penalties, or other remedies, including orders to conduct remediation, as well as restrictions on or added costs for business operations going forward, including in the form of restrictions on discharges at manufacturing facilities, requiring the installation of control technologies, suspension or shutdown of facility operations, switching costs in seeking alternative sources of supply, potential customer damage claims due to supply disruptions or otherwise, restoration of and/or compensation for damages to natural resources, personal injury and property damages, and reporting requirements or bans on PFAS and PFAS-containing products manufactured by the Company. The Company may also record asset retirement obligations, some of which may be material, depending in part on how the Company manages related assets in connection with these activities. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or consolidated financial position.\n\n* The Company is subject to risks related to international, federal, state, and local treaties, laws, and regulations, as well as compliance risks related to legal or regulatory requirements, contract requirements, policies and practices, or other matters that require or encourage the Company or its suppliers, vendors, or channel partners to conduct business in a certain way. The outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings related to compliance with these treaties, laws, regulations, and requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Company's reputation, ability to execute its strategy and its results of operations.\n\nThe Company operates globally, including in some jurisdictions that pose potentially elevated risks of fraud or corruption or increased risk of internal control issues, and is subject to risks related to international, federal, state, and local treaties, laws, and regulations, including those involving product liability; securities and corporate governance; antitrust and competition; intellectual property; environmental, health, and safety; tax; the FCPA and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws; international import and export requirements and trade sanctions compliance; laws and regulations that apply to industries served by the Company, including the False Claims Act, anti-kickback laws, and the Sunshine Act; and other matters. The Company is also subject to compliance risks related to legal or regulatory requirements, contract requirements, policies and practices, or other matters that require or encourage the Company and its suppliers, vendors, or channel parties, to conduct business in a certain way. Legal compliance risks also include third-party risks where the Company's suppliers, vendors, or channel partners, or trade associations to which the Company belongs, have business practices that are inconsistent with 3M's Supplier Responsibility Code, 3M performance requirements, or with legal requirements.",

(See  discussion  within  this  report  of  env ironmental  issues  in  Business  -  Gov ernmental  and  Env ironmental  Regulation,  Item  1; Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Env ironmental, Item 7; and Note 17 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8.)\n\n## Item 3. Legal Proceedings\n\nFrom time to time, we are inv olv ed in legal proceedings, claims, and litigation that occur in connection with our business.  We routinely assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest av ailable information and, when necessary, we seek input from our third-party  adv isors  when  making  these  assessments.  Consistent  with  SEC  rules  and  requirements,  we  describe  below  material  pending  legal proceedings  (other  than  ordinary  routine  litigation  incidental  to  our  business),  material  proceedings  known  to  be  contemplated  by  gov ernmental authorities,  other  proceedings  arising  under  federal,  state,  or  local  env ironmental  laws  and  regulations  (including  gov ernmental  proceedings  inv olv ing potential  fines,  penalties,  or  other  monetary  sanctions  in  excess  of  $1,000,000),  and  such  other  pending  matters  that  we  may  determine  to  be appropriate. See also Note 17 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Date, Item 8.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\n\nWe receive notices from the EPA and state env ironmental agencies alleging that we are or may be liable under federal or state env ironmental laws for remediation costs at v arious sites throughout the  U.S., including sites on the  Superfund  National  Priorities  List  or  state  superfund  lists.  We  cannot predict the ultimate impact of these proceedings and suits because of the number of potentially responsible parties inv olv ed, the degree of contamination by v arious wastes, the scarcity and quality of v olumetric data related to many of the sites, and the speculativ e nature of remediation costs.\n\nInformation concerning env ironmental claims and contingencies and estimated remediation costs is set forth in this report in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Env ironmental, Item 7, and Note 17 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8.\n\n## OTHER MATTERS\n\nAntitrust Litigation - As we reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2007, 20 rail shippers (many of whom were represented by the same law firms) filed v irtually identical antitrust lawsuits in v arious federal district courts against us and four other Class I railroads in the U.S. Currently, UPRR and three other Class I railroads are the named defendants in the lawsuits. The original plaintiff filed the first of these claims in the U.S. District Court in New Jersey on May 14, 2007. These suits alleged that the named railroads engaged in price-fixing by establishing common fuel surcharges for certain rail traffic.\n\nOn August 16, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the  District of  Columbia  Circuit (D.C.  Circuit) affirmed the decision of  U.S.  District  Court for the District of Columbia (U.S. District Court) denying class certification (the Certification Denial). Only fiv e plaintiffs remain in this multidistrict litigation (MDL I) originally filed in 2007. T he MDL I claims prev iously were proceeding on a consolidated basis in the U.S. District of Columbia District Court before the Honorable Paul L. Friedman. In 2024, they were transferred to the Honorable Beryl A. Howell.\n\nSince the Certification Denial, approximately 106 lawsuits by indiv idual shippers are pending in federal court based on claims essentially identical to those alleged in MDL I. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated these suits for pretrial proceedings in the U.S. District Court before the Honorable Beryl A. Howell (MDL II).\n\nAs we reported in our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed on June 10, 2011, Oxbow Carbon &amp; Minerals LLC and related entities (Oxbow) filed a complaint against UPRR in the U.S. District Court on June 7, 2011. In 2019, Oxbow dismissed certain claims and the claims that remain are the same as the Plaintiffs'  claims  in  MDL  I.  Oxbow's  claims  prev iously  were  proceeding  in  the  U.S.  District  of  Columbia  District  Court  before  the  Honorable  Pail  L. Friedman. In 2024, Oxbow's case was transferred to the Honorable Beryl A. Howell.\n\nWe continue to deny the allegations that our fuel surcharge programs v iolate the antitrust laws or any other laws. We believ e that these lawsuits are without merit, and we will v igorously defend our actions. T herefore, we currently believ e that these matters will not hav e a material adv erse effect on any of our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.",

In addition, the Company may be unable to find suitable alternatives for goods and services that Solventum temporarily provides to the Company pursuant to the agreements noted above, or such alternative goods and services may be more expensive than provided by Solventum to the Company.\n\nThe Company retained an equity interest in Solventum in connection with the spin-off. The Company cannot predict the trading price of shares of Solventum's common stock and the market value of the Solventum shares is subject to market volatility and other factors outside of the Company's control. The Company intends to divest its ownership interest in Solventum within five years from the spin-off, but there can be no assurance regarding the timing of, or timeframe over which, such divestiture or divestitures may occur, or the amount of proceeds received by the Company in connection with any such divestitures.\n\nIn addition, while it is intended that the transaction be tax -free to the Company's stockholders for U.S. federal income tax  purposes, there is no assurance that the transactions will qualify for this treatment.

These processes are integrated into the Company's overall risk management systems, as overseen by the Company's board of directors, primarily through its audit committee. These processes also include overseeing and identifying risks from cybersecurity threats associated with the use of third-party service providers. The Company conducts security assessments of certain third-party providers before engagement and has established monitoring procedures in its effort to mitigate risks related to data breaches or other security incidents originating from third parties. The Company from time to time engages third-party consultants, legal advisors, and audit firms in evaluating and testing the Company's risk management systems and assessing and remediating certain cybersecurity incidents. The Company also continues to provide its employees with cybersecurity and data protection training to support its risk mitigation efforts.\n\n## Governance\n\n## Board of Directors\n\nThe audit committee of the Company's board of directors oversees, among other things, the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's internal controls, including internal controls designed to assess, identify, and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats. The audit committee is informed of material risks from cybersecurity threats pursuant to the escalation criteria as set forth in the Company's disclosure controls and procedures. Further, at least once per quarter, the Company's Chief Information and Digital Officer ('CIDO'), and/or the Company's Chief Information Security Officer ('CISO'), reports on cybersecurity matters, including material risks and threats, to the Company's audit committee, and the audit committee provides updates to the Company's board of directors at regular board meetings. The CIDO also provides updates annually or more frequently as appropriate to the Company's board of directors.\n\n## Management\n\nUnder the oversight of the audit committee of the Company's board of directors, and as directed by the Company's Chief Executive Officer, the CIDO and CISO are primarily responsible for the assessment and management of material cybersecurity risks. The CIDO has more than two decades of experience with global technology organizations across multiple industries. The CISO has over 25 years of experience in information security, risk management, and compliance, has served as the chief information security officer at other organizations and, among other things, is a certified information systems security professional. The CIDO and CISO are also supported by a Cybersecurity &amp; Privacy Executive Oversight Committee, which is comprised of certain members of senior management and is provides crossfunctional support for cybersecurity risk management and facilitates the response to any cybersecurity incidents.\n\nThe Company's CISO oversees the Company's cybersecurity incident response plan and related processes that are designed to assess and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats. The Company's CISO also coordinates with the Company's legal counsel and third parties, such as consultants and legal advisors, to assess and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats. The Company's CISO is informed about and monitors the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents pursuant to criteria set forth in the Company's incident response plan and related processes.",

The amended complaint seeks substantial, but unspecified, compensatory damages primarily for reimbursement of the costs allegedly incurred by the State for worker's compensation and healthcare benefits provided to all workers with occupational pneumoconiosis and unspecified punitive damages. In October 2019, the court granted the State's motion to sever its unfair trade practices claim, which seeks civil penalties of up to $5,000 per violation under the state's Consumer Credit Protection Act relating to statements that the State contends were misleading about 3M's 8710 respirators, which were last sold by the Company by 1998 in the United States.\n\nOn Thursday, January 9, 2025, an initial bench trial began on certain issues in the action. The issues presented during the bench trial included the statute of limitations, the period available for penalties under the West Virginia Consumer Protection Act, and the State's claims that the 8710 respirators did not perform as advertised.\n\nFollowing resolution by the court of the issues presented during the initial bench trial, the amount, if any, of any civil penalties upon a finding of liability against the Company would be determined through subsequent trial proceedings at an unspecified future date. An expert witness retained by the State has estimated that 3M sold over five million respirators into the state during the relevant time period, and the State alleges that each respirator sold constitutes a separate violation under the Act. 3M disputes the expert's estimates and the State's position regarding what constitutes a separate violation of the Act. 3M has asserted various additional defenses, including that the Company's marketing did not violate the Act at any time, and that the State's claims are barred under the applicable statute of limitations. No liability has been recorded for any portion of this matter because the Company believes that liability is not probable and reasonably estimable at this time. In addition, the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss due to open factual and legal questions.\n\nRespirator Mask/Asbestos Liabilities and Insurance Recovery\n\nThe Company regularly conducts a comprehensive legal review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities. The Company reviews recent and historical claims data, including without limitation, (i) the number of pending claims filed against the Company, (ii) the nature and mix  of those claims (i.e., the proportion of claims asserting usage of the Company's mask or respirator products and alleging exposure to each of asbestos, silica, coal or other occupational dusts, and claims pleading use of asbestos-containing products allegedly manufactured by the Company), (iii) the costs to defend and resolve pending claims, and (iv) trends in filing rates and in costs to defend and resolve claims (collectively, the 'Claims Data'). As part of its comprehensive legal review, the Company regularly provides the Claims Data to a third party with ex pertise in determining the impact of Claims Data on future filing trends and costs. The third party assists the Company in estimating the costs to defend and resolve pending and future claims. The Company uses this analysis to develop its estimate of probable liability.\n\nDevelopments may occur that could affect the Company's estimate of its liabilities. These developments include, but are not limited to, significant changes in (i) the key assumptions underlying the Company's accrual, including the number of future claims, the nature and mix of those claims, and the average cost of defending and resolving claims and in maintaining trial readiness (ii) trial and appellate outcomes, (iii) the law and procedure applicable to these claims, and (iv) the financial viability of other co-defendants and insurers.\n\nAs a result of its review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities, of pending and ex pected lawsuits and of the cost of resolving claims of persons who claim more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, the Company increased its accruals in 2024 for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities by $36 million. In 2024, the Company made payments for legal defense costs and settlements of $87 million related to the respirator mask/asbestos litigation. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had an accrual for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities (excluding Aearo accruals) of $523 million. This accrual represents the Company's estimate of probable loss and reflects an estimation period for future claims that may be filed against the Company approaching the year 2050. The Company cannot estimate the amount or upper end of the range of amounts by which the liability may exceed the accrual the Company has established because of (i) the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted or the time period in which future claims may be asserted, (ii) the fact that complaints nearly always assert claims against multiple defendants where the damages alleged are typically not attributed to individual defendants so that a defendant's share of liability may turn on the law of joint and several liability, which can vary by state, (iii) the multiple factors described above that the Company considers in estimating its liabilities, and (iv) the several possible developments described above that may occur that could affect the Company's estimate of liabilities.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had an immaterial receivable for insurance recoveries related to the respirator mask/asbestos litigation. In addition, the Company continues to seek coverage under the policies of certain insolvent and other insurers. Once those claims for coverage are resolved, the Company will have collected substantially all of its remaining insurance coverage for respirator mask/asbestos claims.",

      "question": "How might Pratt & Whitney's accelerated inspection requirements for the PW1100G-JM Geared Turbofan engine, caused by powder metal issues, impact Boeing's financial reporting under its program accounting methodology for commercial aircraft programs?",
      "answer": "Pratt & Whitney's powder metal issue necessitates accelerated inspections of the PW1100G-JM engine, which powers the A320neo family of aircraft (RTX 10-K). This increases maintenance and parts replacement costs for engine operators and potentially affects delivery schedules. Boeing, which uses program accounting for its commercial aircraft programs, recognizes cost of sales as a function of revenue recognized and the estimated total cost at completion for each aircraft program (BA 10-K). If Boeing's aircraft programs rely on engines from Pratt & Whitney or face similar powder metal-related supply chain disruptions, Boeing would have to update its estimated total costs, which would increase reported cost of sales and reduce profitability for affected programs. This demonstrates how component-level manufacturing issues in the aerospace supply chain can flow through to financial reporting for both engine manufacturers and aircraft original equipment manufacturers.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source B (RTX 10-K) - Pratt & Whitney identified a powder metal issue requiring accelerated inspections of the PW1100G-JM Geared Turbofan engine, which powers the A320neo aircraft.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source A (BA 10-K) - Boeing's Commercial Airplanes (BCA) segment uses program accounting, where cost of sales equals the product of revenue recognized and estimated total cost at completion for each aircraft program.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - If Boeing's aircraft programs integrate engines affected by similar powder metal issues or face supply chain delays due to inspection requirements, Boeing would have to revise upward its estimated total costs, increasing reported cost of sales and reducing profitability under its program accounting methodology."

          "chunk_text": "In the normal management of our aircraft fleet, we routinely idle aircraft and engines temporarily due to maintenance cycles and adjustments of our network capacity to match seasonality and overall customer demand levels. Temporarily idled assets are classified as available-for-use, and we continue to record depreciation expense associated with these assets. These temporarily idled assets are assessed for impairment and remaining life on a quarterly basis. The criteria for determining whether an asset has been permanently removed from service (and, as a result, is potentially impaired) include, but are not limited to, our global economic outlook and the impact of our outlook on our current and projected volume levels, including capacity needs during our peak shipping seasons; the introduction of new fleet types or decisions to permanently retire an aircraft fleet from operations; and changes to planned service expansion activities. At May 31, 2024, we had 19 aircraft temporarily idled. These aircraft have been idled for an average of eight months and are expected to return to revenue service in order to meet expected demand.\n\nDuring 2023, we reviewed long-lived assets at FedEx Dataworks for impairment. Based on our reviews, we recognized an $11 million ($8 million, net of tax, or $0.03 per diluted share) asset impairment charge related to an intangible asset from the ShopRunner acquisition. For more information, see Note 4 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\nLEASES . We utilize operating leases to finance certain of our aircraft, facilities, and equipment. Such arrangements typically shift the risk of loss on the residual value of the assets at the end of the lease period to the lessor. We had $18 billion in operating lease liabilities and $17 billion in related right-of-use assets on the balance sheet as of May 31, 2024. The weighted-average remaining lease term of all operating leases outstanding at May 31, 2024 was 9.5 years.\n\nOur leases generally contain options to extend or terminate the lease. We reevaluate our leases on a regular basis to consider the economic and strategic incentives of exercising the renewal options, and how they align with our operating strategy. Therefore, substantially all the renewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability as the options to extend are not reasonably certain at lease commencement. Short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized in the right-to-use asset and lease liability on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe lease liabilities are measured at the lease commencement date and determined using the present value of the minimum lease payments not yet paid and our incremental borrowing rate, which approximates the rate at which we would borrow, on a collateralized basis, over the term of a lease in the applicable currency environment. The interest rate implicit in the lease is generally not determinable in transactions where we are the lessee.\n\nThe determination of whether a lease is accounted for as a finance lease or an operating lease requires management to make estimates primarily about the fair value of the asset and its estimated economic useful life. In addition, our evaluation includes ensuring we properly account for build-to-suit lease arrangements and making judgments about whether various forms of lessee involvement allow the lessee to control the underlying leased asset during the construction period. We believe we have well-defined and controlled processes for making these evaluations, including obtaining third-party appraisals for material transactions to assist us in making these evaluations.\n\nGOODWILL . We had $6.4 billion of recorded goodwill at May 31, 2024 and 2023 from our business acquisitions, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Several factors give rise to goodwill in our acquisitions, such as the ex pected benefits from synergies of the combination and the existing workforce of the acquired business.\n\nGoodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment. In our evaluation of goodwill impairment, we perform a qualitative assessment that requires management judgment and the use of estimates to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. An entity has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test. An entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. We performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2024 and both qualitative and quantitative assessments of goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2023. The quantitative assessment included comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value (including attributable goodwill). Fair value is estimated using standard valuation methodologies (principally the income or market approach classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy) incorporating market participant considerations and management's assumptions on revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates, and expected capital expenditures. Estimates used by management can significantly affect the outcome of the impairment test. Changes in forecasted operating results and other assumptions could materially affect these estimates.\n\nAs part of our qualitative assessment, we consider changes in the macroeconomic environment such as the general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign ex change rates, and other developments in equity and credit markets.\n\nOur reporting units with significant recorded goodwill include FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, and FedEx Freight. We evaluated these reporting units during the fourth quarters of 2024 and 2023 and the estimated fair value of each of these reporting units exceeded their",

Temporarily idled assets are classified as available-for-use, and we continue to record depreciation expense associated with these assets. These temporarily idled assets are assessed for impairment and remaining life on a quarterly basis. The criteria for determining whether an asset has been permanently removed from service (and, as a result, is potentially impaired) include, but are not limited to, our global economic outlook and the impact of our outlook on our current and projected volume levels, including capacity needs during our peak shipping seasons; the introduction of new fleet types or decisions to permanently retire an aircraft fleet from operations; and changes to planned service expansion activities. At May 31, 2024, we had 19 aircraft temporarily idled. These aircraft have been idled for an average of eight months and are expected to return to revenue service in order to meet expected demand.\n\nDuring 2023, we reviewed long-lived assets at FedEx Dataworks for impairment. Based on our reviews, we recognized an $11 million ($8 million, net of tax, or $0.03 per diluted share) asset impairment charge related to an intangible asset from the ShopRunner acquisition.

Our largest pension plan covers certain U.S. employees age 21 and over, with at least one year of service. Pension benefits for most employees are accrued under a cash balance formula we call the Portable Pension Account ('PPA'). Under the PPA, the retirement benefit is expressed as a dollar amount in a notional account that grows with annual credits based on pay, age and years of credited service, and interest on the notional account balance. The PPA benefit is payable as a lump sum or an annuity at retirement at the election of the employee. The plan interest credit rate varies from year to year based on a U.S. Treasury index. Prior to 2009, certain employees earned benefits using a traditional pension formula (based on average earnings and years of service). Benefits under this formula were capped on May 31, 2008 for most employees.\n\nWe also sponsor or participate in nonqualified benefit plans covering certain of our U.S. employee groups and other pension plans covering certain of our international employees. The international defined benefit pension plans provide benefits primarily based on earnings and years of service and are funded in compliance with local laws and practices. The majority of our international obligations are for defined benefit pension plans in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 2020, we announced the closing of our U.S.-based defined benefit pension plans to new non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2020. We introduced an all-401(k) plan retirement benefit structure for eligible employees with a higher company match of up to 8% across all U.S.-based operating companies in 2022. During calendar 2021, current eligible employees under the PPA pension formula were given a one-time option to continue to be eligible for pension compensation credits under the existing PPA formula and remain in the existing 401(k) plan with its company match of up to 3.5%, or to cease receiving compensation credits under the PPA and move to the new 401(k) plan with the higher match of up to 8%. Changes to the new 401(k) plan structure became effective January 1, 2022. See Note 1 for additional information on expected amendments to our pension plan offered to FedEx Express pilots.\n\nPOSTRETIREMENT HEALTHCARE PLANS. Certain of our subsidiaries offer medical, dental, and vision coverage to eligible U.S. retirees and their eligible dependents and a small number of international employees. U.S. employees covered by the principal plan become eligible for these benefits at age 55 and older, if they have permanent, continuous service of at least 10 years after attainment of age 45 if hired prior to January 1, 1988, or at least 20 years after attainment of age 35 if hired on or after January 1, 1988.\n\nThe U.S. postretirement healthcare benefit is a lump-sum benefit in a notional retiree health reimbursement account ('HRA') for eligible participants. The HRA is available to reimburse a participant for qualifying healthcare premium costs and limits the company liability to the HRA account balance. The amount of the credit is based on age at retirement. Retiree health coverage was closed to most new employees hired on or after January 1, 2018.\n\nPENSION PLAN ASSUMPTIONS. The accounting for pension and postretirement healthcare plans includes numerous assumptions, such as: discount rates; expected long-term investment returns on plan assets; future salary increases; employee turnover; mortality; and retirement ages.\n\nWeighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost of our plans are as follows:\n\n",

As a result of these transactions, the Company has a narrower business which is focused on higher growth markets including software, innov ation and disruptiv e technologies, and may encounter more v olatility and be more v ulnerable to changing market conditions. The success of these transactions will depend on our ability to achiev e higher rates of growth, integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions and to cooperate with our strategic partners. We may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations as well as separating div ested businesses, and in managing strategic inv estments. Furthermore, we may not realize the degree, or timing, of anticipated benefits including, among others, increasing rates of profitability and growth. Any of the foregoing could adv ersely affect our business and results of operations.\n\nOur Portfolio Actions Including the Proposed Acquisition of the Remaining Interest in AspenTech Not Already Ow ned by the Company and the Process to Explore Strategic Alternatives for the Company's Safety &amp; Productivity Segment May Not Be Completed or Completed on the Terms and Conditions Contemplated, or With the Expected Benefits\n\nOn November 5, 2024, the Company announced a proposal to acquire all outstanding shares of common stock of AspenTech not already owned by Emerson for $240 per share in cash, which implies a fully diluted market capitalization for AspenTech of $15.3 billion and an enterprise v alue of $15.1 billion, and would be financed from cash on hand, committed lines of credit and/or other av ailable sources of financing. Also on Nov ember 5, 2024, the Company announced that it is exploring strategic alternativ es, including a cash sale, for its Safety &amp; Productiv ity segment. No assurance can be giv en whether the proposal or the rev iew will lead to one or more transactions. We can make no assurance as to the completion, terms, timing, costs or benefits anticipated from any such transactions. Unforeseen dev elopments, including delays in obtaining v arious tax, regulatory and other approv als, could delay any such transactions, or cause one or more of them to occur on terms and conditions that are less fav orable, or at a higher cost, than expected.\n\nWe Use a Variety of Raw  Materials and Components in Our Businesses, and Significant Shortages or Price Increases Could Increase Our Operating Costs and Adversely Impact the Competitive Positions of Our Products\n\nOur major requirements for raw materials include steel, cast iron, electronics, rare earth metals, aluminum, brass and, to a lesser extent, plastics and petroleum-based chemicals. The Company seeks multiple sources of supply for each of its major requirements in order to av oid significant dependence on any one or a few suppliers. Howev er, the supply of materials or other items could be disrupted by natural disasters, a health epidemic or pandemic, or other ev ents. Significant shortages or price increases could impact the prices our affected businesses charge, their operating costs and the competitiv e position of their products and serv ices, which could adv ersely affect our results of operations. While we monitor market prices of the commodities we require and attempt to mitigate price exposure through hedging activ ities, this risk could adv ersely affect our operating results.\n\nOur Operations Depend on Production Facilities Throughout the World, a Majority of Which Are Located Outside the United States and Subject to Increased Risks of Disrupted Production, Causing Delays in Shipments and Loss of Customers and Revenue\n\nWe manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide, a majority of which are located outside the United States, and also source certain materials globally. Emerging market sales represent ov er one-third of total sales and serv ing a global customer base requires that we place more materials sourcing and production in emerging markets to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain a best-cost position. Our and our suppliers' non-U.S. production facilities and operations could be disrupted by weather and natural disaster (including the potential effects of climate change), labor strife, war (including the Russia-Ukraine and other global conflicts), political unrest, terrorist activ ity or public health concerns such as an epidemic or pandemic, particularly in emerging countries that are not well-equipped to handle such occurrences.\n\nOur manufacturing facilities abroad are dependent on the stability of gov ernments and business conditions and may be more susceptible to changes in laws, policies and regulations in host countries, as well as economic and political upheav al, than our domestic facilities. These facilities face increased risks of nationalization as well as operational disruptions which could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers, and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate us.",

In addition to incurring direct costs to implement any climate-change related laws, regulations or policies, we may see indirect costs rise, such as increased energy or material costs, as a result of policies affecting other sectors of the economy. Although most of these increased costs likely would be recoverable through pricing, to the extent that the increase in our costs as a result of these policies are greater than our competitors, we may be less competitive on future bids or the total increased cost in our industry's products and services could result in lower demand from our customers. We monitor developments in climate change-related laws, regulations and policies for their potential effect on us, however, we currently are not able to accurately predict the materiality of any potential costs associated with such developments. In addition, climate change-related litigation and investigations have increased in recent years and any claims or investigations against us could be costly to defend and our business could be adversely affected by the outcome.\n\n## We are involved in a number of legal proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of litigation and other contingencies with certainty.\n\nOur business may be adversely affected by the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty. As required by U.S. GAAP, we estimate loss contingencies and establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable  considering  the  facts  and  circumstances  known  to  us  at  a  particular  point  in  time.  Subsequent  developments  in  legal  proceedings  may  affect  our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a liability or as a reserve against assets in our financial statements. For a description of our current legal proceedings, see Item 3 - Legal Proceedings, 'Critical Accounting Policies - Environmental Matters' in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition  and  Results  of  Operations  and  'Note  14  -  Legal  Proceedings,  Commitments  and  Contingencies'  included  in  our  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial Statements.\n\n## Risks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\n\n## There can be no assurance that we will continue to increase our dividend or to repurchase shares of our common stock.\n\nCash dividend payments and share repurchases are subject to limitations under applicable laws and the discretion of our Board of Directors and are determined after considering then-existing conditions, including earnings, other operating results and capital requirements and cash deployment alternatives. Our payment of dividends and share repurchases could vary from historical practices or our stated expectations.  Decreases in asset values or increases in liabilities, including liabilities associated with employee benefit plans and assets and liabilities associated with taxes, can reduce net earnings and stockholders' equity. Under certain circumstances, a deficit in stockholders' equity could limit our ability to pay dividends and make share repurchases under Maryland state law in the future. In addition, the timing and amount of share repurchases under Board of Directors approved share repurchase plans may differ from stated expectations and is within the discretion of management and will depend on many factors, including our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future or to borrow money from available financing sources, our results of operations, capital requirements and applicable law.\n\n## ITEM 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments\n\nNone.\n\n## ITEM 1C.    Cybersecurity\n\n## Risk Management and Strategy\n\nWe believe cybersecurity is critical to advancing our 21st Century Security vision and enabling our digital transformation efforts. As an aerospace and defense company, we face a multitude of cybersecurity threats that range from attacks common to most industries, such as ransomware and denial-of-service, to attacks from more advanced and persistent,  highly  organized  adversaries,  including  nation  state  actors,  some  of  which  target  the  defense  industrial  base  and  other  critical infrastructure sectors. Our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and joint venture partners face similar cybersecurity threats, and a cybersecurity incident impacting us or any of these entities could materially adversely affect our operations, performance and results of operations. These cybersecurity threats and related risks make it imperative that we strive to be a leader in the information security field, and we ex pend considerable resources on cybersecurity.\n\nOur corporate information security organization has implemented a governance structure and processes to assess, identify, manage and report cybersecurity risks. We also have a corporate-wide counterintelligence and insider threat detection program to proactively identify external and internal threats and mitigate those threats in a timely manner. As a defense contractor, we must comply with extensive regulations, including requirements imposed by the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) related to adequately safeguarding controlled unclassified information (CUI) and reporting cybersecurity incidents to the DoD.

Fair v alues are subject to changes in underlying economic conditions.\n\nWith the exception of certain trade names, all of the Company's identifiable intangible assets are subject to amortization on a straight-line basis ov er their estimated useful liv es. Identifiable intangibles consist of intellectual property such as technology, patents and trademarks, customer relationships and capitalized software. Identifiable intangibles are also subject to ev aluation for potential impairment if ev ents or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. See Note 10.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe Company leases offices; manufacturing facilities and equipment; and transportation, information technology and office equipment under operating lease arrangements. Finance lease arrangements are immaterial. The Company determines whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at contract inception. An arrangement contains a lease if the Company has the right to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of an identified asset. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at lease commencement based on the present v alue of lease payments ov er the lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet and are recorded as short-term lease expense. The discount rate used to calculate present v alue is the Company's incremental borrowing rate based on the lease term and the economic env ironment of the applicable country or region.\n\nCertain leases contain renewal options or options to terminate prior to lease expiration, which are included in the measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities when it is reasonably certain they will be exercised. The Company has elected to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for its offices and manufacturing facilities. Some lease arrangements include payments that are adjusted periodically based on actual charges incurred for common area maintenance, utilities, taxes and insurance, or changes in an index or rate referenced in the lease. The fixed portion of these payments is included in the measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at lease commencement, while the v ariable portion is recorded as v ariable lease expense. The Company's leases typically do not contain material residual v alue guarantees or restrictiv e cov enants.\n\n## Product Warranty\n\nWarranties v ary by product line and are competitiv e for the markets in which the Company operates. Warranties are largely offered to prov ide assurance that the product will function as intended and generally extend for a period of one to two years from the date of sale or installation. Prov isions for warranty expense are estimated at the time of sale based on historical experience and adjusted quarterly for any known issues that may arise. Product warranty expense is less than one-half of one percent of sales.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nEmerson is a global manufacturer that designs and manufactures products and deliv ers serv ices that bring technology and engineering together to prov ide innov ativ e solutions for its customers. The Company ev aluates its contracts with customers to identify the promised goods or serv ices and recognizes rev enue for the identified performance obligations at the amount the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or serv ices. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or serv ice to a customer. Rev enue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied and control has transferred to the customer, typically when products are shipped or deliv ered, title and risk of loss pass to the customer, and the Company has a present right to payment. The majority of the Company's rev enues relate to a broad offering of manufactured products and software which are recognized at the point in time when control transfers, generally in accordance with shipping terms, or the first day of the contractual term for software. A portion of the Company's rev enues relate to the sale of post-contract customer support, parts and labor for repairs, and engineering serv ices. In some circumstances, contracts include multiple performance obligations, where rev enue is recognized separately for each good or serv ice, as well as contracts where rev enue is recognized ov er time as control transfers to the customer.\n\nRevenue is recognized ov er time for approximately 10 percent of the Company's rev enues. These rev enues primarily relate to projects in the Control Systems &amp; Software segment where revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method to reflect the transfer of control ov er time, and software maintenance contracts in the Software and Control business group where rev enue is typically recognized on a straight-line basis. Approximately 15 percent of rev enues relate to sales arrangements with multiple performance obligations, principally in the Software and Control business group. Tangible products represent a large majority of the deliv ered",

G enerally, we also have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a joint venture partner.\n\nIn determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, performance on contractual obligations, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current and former joint venture partners and the transferee under novation agreements, all of which include a guarantee as required by the FAR. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no material amounts recorded in our financial statements related to third-party guarantees or novation agreements.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. We employ judgment in making our estimates in consideration of historical experience, currently  available  information  and  various  other  assumptions  that  we  believe  to  be  reasonable  under  the  circumstances. Actual  results  could  differ  from  our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of our consolidated financial statements and require the use of significant management judgment in their application. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see 'Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Contract Accounting / Sales Recognition\n\nThe majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. G overnment and international customers (including FMS contracted through the U.S. G overnment) for the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We recognize  revenue  as  performance  obligations  are  satisfied  and  the  customer  obtains  control  of  the  products  and  services.  Substantially  all  of  our  revenue  is recognized over time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfers continuously to the customer. For performance obligations in which control transfers continuously to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage of completion cost-to-cost measure of progress.\n\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales, costs, and profit. We estimate profit as the difference between estimated revenues and total estimated costs to complete the contract. We also estimate variable",

          "chunk_text": "\n## Asset Classes\n\nU.S. equities reflect companies domiciled in the U.S., including multinational companies. International equities are comprised of companies domiciled in developed nations outside the U.S. Emerging market equities are comprised of companies domiciled in portions of Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America. Corporate bonds represent inv estment-grade debt of issuers primarily from the U.S. Gov ernment bonds include inv estment-grade instruments issued by federal, state and local gov ernments, primarily in the U.S. Other includes cash, interests in mixed asset funds inv esting in commodities, natural resources, agriculture, real estate and infrastructure funds, life insurance contracts (U.S.), and shares in certain general inv estment funds of financial institutions or insurance arrangements (non-U.S.) that typically ensure no market losses or prov ide for a small minimum return guarantee.\n\n## Fair Value Hierarchy Categories\n\nValuations of Lev el 1 assets for all classes are based on quoted closing market prices from the principal exchanges where the indiv idual securities are traded. Cash is v alued at cost, which approximates fair v alue. Debt securities categorized as Lev el 2 assets are generally v alued based on independent broker/dealer bids or by comparison to other debt securities hav ing similar durations, yields and credit ratings. Valuation techniques and inputs for these assets include discounted cash flow analysis, earnings multiple approaches, recent transactions, transfer restrictions, prev ailing discount rates, volatilities, credit ratings and other factors. In the Other class, interests in mixed asset funds are Lev el 2, and U.S. life insurance contracts and non-U.S. general fund inv estments and insurance arrangements are Lev el 3. Inv estments measured at NAV are primarily nonexchange-traded commingled or collectiv e funds where the underlying securities hav e observ able prices av ailable from activ e markets and typically prov ide liquidity daily or within a few days. The NAV category also includes fund inv estments in priv ate equities, real estate and infrastructure where the fair v alue of the underlying assets is determined by the inv estment manager. Total unfunded commitments for the priv ate equity funds were approximately $90 at September 30, 2024. These inv estments cannot be redeemed, but instead the funds will make distributions through liquidation of the underlying assets, which is expected to occur over approximately the next 10 years. The real estate and infrastructure funds typically offer quarterly redemption.\n\n## Postretirement Plans\n\nThe Company also sponsors unfunded postretirement benefit plans (primarily health care) for certain U.S. retirees and their dependents. The Company's principal U.S. postretirement plan has been frozen to new employees since 1993. The postretirement benefit liability for all plans was $71 and $72 as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectiv ely, and included deferred actuarial gains in accumulated other comprehensiv e income of $68 and $95, respectiv ely. Serv ice and interest costs are negligible and more than offset by the amortization of deferred actuarial gains, which resulted in net postretirement income of $18 for 2024, $19 for 2023 and $12 for 2022.

In contrast, UPS stated that its international defined contribution plans are 'not individually material' and did not disclose a specific figure.

      "answer": "BA utilizes the sum-of-the-years' digits method for depreciating machinery and equipment, which results in higher depreciation expenses in the early years of an asset's life. GE does not specify its depreciation method but reports a net carrying value of $3,851 million for machinery and equipment in 2024, compared to an original cost of $11,533 million. This indicates that GE's machinery and equipment retain about 33.4% of their original value (3,851 / 11,533). BA's accelerated depreciation approach likely results in a lower net carrying value relative to original cost compared to a straight-line method, which could suggest a more conservative balance sheet presentation for BA.",

        "Step 4: Synthesize - BA's accelerated depreciation method (sum-of-the-years' digits) results in faster write-down of asset values compared to GE's unspecified method, which appears to result in a higher retention of original value. This affects how the net carrying value of assets is presented on the balance sheet and impacts earnings quality through higher early depreciation expenses for BA."

Spare parts inv entory is stated at lower of av erage unit cost or net realizable v alue. We rev iew our commercial spare parts and general stock materials quarterly to identify impaired inv entory, including excess or obsolete inv entory, based on historical sales trends, expected production usage, and the size and age of the aircraft fleet using the part. Impaired inv entories are charged to Cost of products in the period the impairment occurs.\n\nIncluded in inv entory for commercial aircraft programs are amounts paid or credited in cash, or other consideration to certain airline customers, that are referred to as early issue sales consideration. Early issue sales consideration is recognized as a reduction to rev enue when the deliv ery of the aircraft under contract occurs. If an airline customer does not perform and take deliv ery of the contracted aircraft, we believ e that we would hav e the ability to recover amounts paid. However, to the extent early issue sales consideration exceeds adv ances and is not considered to be otherwise recov erable, it would be written off against rev enue of the current period.\n\n## Precontract Costs\n\nWe may, from time to time, incur costs in excess of the amounts required for existing contracts. If we determine the costs are probable of recov ery from future orders, then we capitalize the precontract costs we incur, excluding start-up costs which are expensed as incurred. Capitalized precontract costs are included in Inv entories in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Should future orders not materialize or we determine the costs are no longer probable of recov ery, the capitalized costs would be written off.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including applicable construction-period interest, less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated principally ov er the following estimated useful liv es: new buildings and land improv ements, from 10 to 40 years; and new machinery and equipment, from 4 to 20 years. The principal method of depreciation for buildings and land improv ements is 150% declining balance and for machinery and equipment is sum-of-the-years' digits. Capitalized internal use software is included in Other assets, net and amortized using the straight line method ov er 5  years. Capitalized costs of software purchased as a serv ice are included in Other assets, net and amortized using the straight line method ov er the term of the hosting arrangement, which is typically no greater than 10 years. We periodically ev aluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable liv es assigned to long-liv ed assets, including assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition.\n\nLong-liv ed assets held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or fair v alue less cost to sell. Long-liv ed assets held for use are subject to an impairment assessment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recov erable. If the carrying v alue is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair v alue of the asset.\n\n## Leases\n\nWe determine if an arrangement is, or contains, a lease under which we are the lessee at the inception date. Operating lease assets are included in Other assets, net, with the related liabilities included in Accrued liabilities and Other long-term liabilities. Assets under finance leases, which primarily represent computer equipment, are included in Property, plant and equipment, net, with the related liabilities included in Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt and Long-term debt on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\n\nOperating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.

      "answer": "The use of the percentage-of-completion method by both Boeing and General Electric leads to revenue being recognized over time based on progress toward contract completion. For Boeing, changes in estimated revenues and costs at completion for long-term contracts result in cumulative catch-up adjustments that directly affect operating income in the period of adjustment. This introduces volatility into financial reporting, as previously recognized revenue and profit must be revised to reflect updated expectations. Similarly, GE applies the percentage-of-completion method to long-term service agreements in its Aerospace division, where revenue recognition depends on cost-to-cost estimates that involve significant management judgment. Changes in these cost estimates also necessitate adjustments that can materially affect reported earnings. Therefore, both companies face operational and financial reporting risks due to the subjective nature of estimating long-term contract costs and the resulting impact of catch-up adjustments on income volatility.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Boeing recognizes revenue on long-term contracts using the percentage-of-completion method, and changes in estimated revenues and costs result in cumulative catch-up adjustments that affect operating income.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies rely on estimates under the percentage-of-completion method, and changes in those estimates trigger adjustments that impact financial results. This shared accounting policy introduces similar financial reporting volatility and operational risk for both Boeing and GE."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nlong-term contracts primarily include support and maintenance agreements associated with our commercial and defense products and space trav el on Commercial Crew.\n\nFor each long-term contract, we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be receiv ed. We allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation to deliv er a good or serv ice, or a collection of goods and/or serv ices, based on the relativ e standalone selling prices. A long-term contract will typically represent a single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying goods and/or serv ices and the significant serv ice of integration that we prov ide. While the scope and price on certain long-term contracts may be modified ov er their life, the transaction price is based on current rights and obligations under the contract and does not include potential modifications until they are agreed upon with the customer. When applicable, a cumulativ e adjustment or separate recognition for the additional scope and price may result. Long-term contracts can be negotiated with a fixed price or a price in which we are reimbursed for costs incurred plus an agreed upon profit. T he Federal Acquisition  Regulations  prov ide  guidance  on  the  types  of  cost  that  will  be  reimbursed  in  establishing  the  price  for  contracts  with  the  U.S. government. Certain long-term contracts include in the transaction price v ariable consideration, such as incentiv e and award fees, if specified targets are achiev ed. The amount included in the transaction price represents the expected v alue, based on a weighted probability, or the most likely amount.\n\nLong-term contract rev enue is recognized ov er the contract term (ov er time) as the work progresses, either as products are produced or as serv ices are rendered. We generally recognize rev enue ov er time as we perform on long-term contracts because of continuous transfer of control to the customer. For U.S.  gov ernment  contracts,  this  continuous  transfer  of  control  to  the  customer  is  supported  by  clauses  in  the  contract  that  allow  the  customer  to unilaterally terminate the contract for conv enience, pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any work in process. Similarly, for non-U.S. gov ernment contracts, the customer typically controls the work in process as ev idenced either by contractual termination clauses or by our rights to payment of the transaction price associated with work performed to date on products or serv ices that do not hav e an alternativ e use to the Company.\n\nThe accounting for long-term contracts inv olv es a judgmental process of estimating total rev enues, costs and profit for each performance obligation. Cost of  sales  is  recognized  as  incurred.  T he  amount  reported  as  rev enues  is  determined  by  adding  a  proportionate  amount  of  the  estimated  profit  to  the amount reported as cost of sales. Recognizing rev enue as costs are incurred prov ides an objectiv e measure of progress on the long-term contract and thereby best depicts the extent of transfer of control to the customer.\n\nFor long-term contracts for which rev enue is recognized ov er time, changes in estimated rev enues, cost of sales and the related effect on operating income are recognized using a cumulativ e catch-up adjustment which recognizes in the current period the cumulativ e effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a long-term contract's percentage-of-completion. When the current estimates of total rev enues and costs at completion for a long-term contract indicate a loss, a prov ision for the entire reach-forward loss on the long-term contract is recognized.\n\nThe table below reflects the impact of net cumulativ e catch-up adjustments for changes in estimated rev enues and costs at completion across all longterm contracts including the impact to Loss from operations from estimated losses on unexercised options for the years ended December 31:\n\n",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of A merica.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company A ccounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCA OB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 3, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCA OB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCA OB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Sales of services - Revenue recognition on certain Aerospace long-term service agreements - Refer to Notes 1 and 8 to the financial statements.\n\n## Critical Audit M atter Description\n\nThe Company enters into long-term service agreements with certain customers. These agreements require the Company to provide maintenance services for customer assets over the contract term, which generally range from 10 to 25 years. Revenue for these agreements is recognized using the percentage of completion method, based on costs incurred relative to total estimated costs over the contract term. A s part of the revenue recognition process, the Company estimates both customer payments that are expected to be received and costs to perform maintenance services over the contract term. Key assumptions within those estimates that require significant judgment from management include: (a) how the customer will utilize the assets covered over the contract term; (b) the expected timing and extent of future overhaul services; (c) the future cost of materials, labor, and other resources; and (d) forward looking information concerning market conditions.\n\nGiven the complexity involved with evaluating the key estimates, which includes significant judgment necessary to estimate future costs, auditing these assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment and extensive audit effort, including the involvement of professionals with specialized skills and industry knowledge.\n\n## How the Critical Audit M atter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur auditing procedures over the key estimates described above related to the amount and timing of revenue recognition of the long-term service agreements included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of controls over the revenue recognition process for the long-term service agreements, including controls over management's key estimates.\n- We evaluated management's risk assessment process through observation of key meetings and processes, including inspection of documentation, addressing contract status and current market conditions including the timely incorporation of changes that affect total estimated costs to complete the contract.\n- We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management's methods and key assumptions applied in recognizing revenue and developing cost estimates.",

      "question": "How does the skilled labor shortage specifically impact GE's product quality assurance processes and UNP's rail replacement programs, and what are the associated financial risks for each company as disclosed in their 10-K filings?",
      "answer": "The skilled labor shortage directly affects GE's ability to maintain rigorous product quality standards across its complex manufacturing and servicing operations, including for commercial and defense aircraft engines and electric power systems. This shortage increases the risk of human error in production, inspection, and maintenance processes, which could lead to increased warranty costs, product recalls, or reputational harm. For UNP, the shortage threatens the availability of qualified personnel necessary for rail operations and infrastructure maintenance, particularly in rail replacement programs that require specialized labor. This could lead to operational inefficiencies, increased reliance on overtime pay, and delays in critical infrastructure projects. Both companies face material adverse effects on their financial condition and operational performance due to these labor constraints.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from GE's 10-K - GE relies on 'highly skilled labor from thousands of workers' to meet exacting product quality and safety standards for complex products like aircraft engines and power systems. Failure to deliver products meeting these standards could result in significant adverse financial effects.",
        "Step 2: Extract from UNP's 10-K - UNP notes that 'unpredictable increases in demand for rail services and a lack of network fluidity may exacerbate our risks related to having insufficient qualified personnel,' which could 'have a negative impact on our operational efficiency' and 'materially affect our results of operations.'",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies explicitly link skilled labor shortages to operational risks: GE to product quality and safety, and UNP to rail operations and infrastructure maintenance. These labor constraints threaten each company's ability to maintain operational efficiency and control costs, with potential material adverse effects on financial performance."

In addition, the Company may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the GE V ernova and GE HealthCare separations and may be exposed to additional risks, including potential liabilities pursuant to agreements entered into in connection with the spinoffs, the credit support provided to GE V ernova (see the Other Items - GE V ernova Parent Company Guarantees section within M D&amp;A ) and the various restructuring and business transformation actions that have brought changes across the Company's organizational structure, senior leadership, functional alignment, outsourcing and other areas. A ny of these risks could result in a material adverse effect on the Company's business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nIntellectual property - Our intellectual property portfolio may not prevent others from independently developing products and services comparable or competitive to ours, and we may be negatively impacted by intellectual property enforcement or external dependencies. Our patents and other intellectual property may not prevent others from independently developing or selling products and services comparable or competitive to ours, and there can be no assurance that the resources invested by us to protect our intellectual property will be sufficient to adequately deter infringement, misappropriation or other improper use of our technology, particularly in certain markets outside the U.S. where strong intellectual property protection mechanisms are lacking. Trademark licenses of the GE brand in connection with dispositions, including in connection with the separations of GE HealthCare and GE V ernova into independent companies, may negatively impact the overall value of the brand in the future. We also face potential competition in countries where we have not invested in a patent portfolio. If we are not able to protect our intellectual property , the v alue of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected. We also face attempts, both internally from insider threats and externally from cyber-attacks, to gain unauthorized access to our IT systems or products for the purpose of improperly acquiring our trade secrets or confidential business information. In addition, we have observed an increase in the use of social engineering tactics by bad actors attempting to access systems storing certain of our trade secrets and other confidential business information. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets or other confidential business information as a result of such incidents could adversely affect our competitive position and the value of certain of our investments in research and development. In addition, we are subject to the enforcement of patents and other apparent intellectual property rights by third parties, including aggressive and opportunistic enforcement claims by non-practicing entities. Regardless of their merit, responding to such claims can be expensive and time-consuming. We also may be found to infringe third-party rights, which could result in us being enjoined from offering some of our products and services or bringing to market new products and services, and require us to pay substantial damages. The value of, or our ability  to use, our intellectual property  may  also be negativ ely  impacted by  dependencies on third parties, such as our ability  to obtain or renew on reasonable terms, or at all, licenses that we need in the future, or our ability to secure or retain ownership or rights to use data in certain software analytics or services offerings.\n\nOPERATIONAL RISKS. Operational risk relates to risks arising from systems, processes, people and external events that affect the operation of our business. It includes risks related to product safety, quality and performance; supply chain and business disruption; operational execution across product and service life cycles; and information management and data protection and security, including cybersecurity.\n\nProduct safety and quality - Our products and services are highly sophisticated and specialized, and a major failure or quality issue affecting our products or third-party products with which our products are integrated can adversely affect our business, reputation, financial position, results of operations and cash flows . We produce highly sophisticated products, including commercial and defense aircraft engines, integrated engine components and electric power and aircraft systems, and we provide specialized services for products that incorporate or use complex or leading-edge technology, including both hardware and software. A ccordingly, the adverse impact of product quality issues can be significant. A ctual or perceived design, production, performance, durability or other quality issues related to new product introductions or existing product lines can result in reputational harm to our business, in addition to the potential need for increased inspections and shop visits, and direct warranty, maintenance and other costs that may arise. In addition, a catastrophic product failure or similar event resulting in injuries or death, a fleet grounding or similar systemic consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, cash flows and results of operations. Even when there have not been significant or widespread product failures in the field, many of our products and services must function under demanding operating conditions and meet exacting and evolving certification, performance, reliability and durability standards that we, our customers or regulators adopt. Developing and maintaining products that meet or exceed these standards can be costly and technologically challenging, and may also involve extensive coordination of suppliers and highly skilled labor from thousands of workers; a failure to deliver products and services that meet these standards could have significant adverse financial, competitive or reputational effects. Technical, mechanical and other failures occur from time to time, whether as a result of human factors, manufacturing or design defects, or operational process or production issues attributable to us, our customers, suppliers, third-party integrators or others.\n\nIn some circumstances we have also incurred, and in the future we may incur, increased costs, delayed payments or lost equipment or services revenue in connection with a significant issue with a third-party product with which our products are integrated, or if parts or other components that we incorporate in our products have defects or other quality issues. For example, a prolonged aircraft grounding, certification or production delays or other adverse developments with aircraft powered by our engines can pose risks to our business. There can be no assurance that the operational processes around sourcing, product design, manufacture, performance and servicing that we or our customers or other third parties have designed to meet rigorous regulatory and quality standards will be sufficient to prev ent us or our customers or other third parties from experiencing operational process or product failures and other problems, including through human factors, manufacturing or design defects, process or other failures of contractors or third-party suppliers, cyber-attacks or other intentional acts, software vulnerabilities or malicious software, that could result in potential product, safety, quality, regulatory or environmental risks.",

An imposition of tariffs on imports or other changes to U.S. trade policy could cause demand for shipping from international markets to decrease, and if the declines are significant enough, it could hav e a material adv erse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\n\nWe Are Dependent on Certain Key Suppliers of Locomotives and Rail - Due to the capital-intensiv e nature and sophistication of locomotiv e equipment, parts,  and  maintenance,  potential  new  suppliers  face  high  barriers  to  entry.  T herefore,  if  one  of  the  domestic  suppliers  of  locomotiv es  discontinues manufacturing locomotiv es, supplying parts, or prov iding maintenance for any reason, including bankruptcy or insolv ency or the inability to manufacture locomotiv es  that  meet  efficiency  or  regulatory  emissions  standards,  we  could  experience  significant  cost  increases  and  reduced  av ailability  of  the locomotiv es that are necessary for our operations. Additionally, we utilize a limited number of steel producers that meet our specifications. Rail is critical to our operations for rail replacement programs, maintenance, and for adding additional network capacity, new rail and storage yards, and expansions of existing facilities. T his industry similarly has high barriers to entry, and if there is any significant consolidations or mergers in this industry, or one  of these suppliers discontinues operations for any reason, including bankruptcy or insolv ency, we could experience both significant cost increases for rail purchases and difficulty obtaining sufficient rail for maintenance and other projects. Changes to trade agreements or policies that result in increased tariffs on goods imported into the United States could also result in significant cost increases for rail purchases and difficulty obtaining sufficient rail.\n\n## Workforce Risks\n\nStrikes  or  Work  Stoppages  Could  Adversely  Affect  Our  Operations -  T he  U.S.  Class  I  railroads  are  party  to  collectiv e  bargaining  agreements  with various labor unions. The majority of our employees belong to labor unions and are subject to these agreements. Disputes ov er the terms of these or future agreements or the terms of such agreements, or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions or the renegotiation of them or their term can lead to, among other things, strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns, or lockouts, any or all of which could compromise our serv ice reliability or cause a significant disruption of our operations, and could increase our costs for wages, health care, and other benefits, which could hav e a material  adv erse  effect  on  our  results  of  operations,  financial  condition,  and  liquidity.  Labor  disputes,  work  stoppages,  slowdowns,  or  lockouts  at loading/unloading facilities, ports, or other transport access points, or by employees of our customers or our suppliers, could compromise our serv ice reliability and hav e a material adv erse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\n\nThe  Availability  of  Qualified  Personnel  Could  Adversely  Affect  Our  Operations -  Changes  in  demographics,  training  requirements,  and  pandemic illnesses or restrictions could negativ ely affect the av ailability of qualified personnel for us, our customers, and throughout the supply chain. Our ability to quickly react to other factors that affect our ability to attract and retain employees may be restricted due to limited flexibility to make unilateral changes to collectiv e bargaining agreements, which cov er the majority of our workforce. Unpredictable increases in demand for rail serv ices and a lack of network fluidity may exacerbate our risks related to hav ing insufficient qualified personnel, which could hav e a negativ e impact on our operational efficiency and otherwise hav e a material adv erse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Risks\n\nWe Are Subject to Significant Governmental Regulation - We are subject to gov ernmental regulation by a significant number of federal, state, and local authorities cov ering a v ariety of health, safety, labor, employment, env ironmental, economic (as discussed below), tax, social, and other matters. Many laws and regulations require us to obtain and maintain v arious licenses, permits, and other authorizations, and we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to do so. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could hav e a material adv erse effect on us as a result of litigation or proceedings  by  priv ate  parties,  gov ernments,  or  regulators,  including  and  in  addition  to  those  described  in  Note  17  to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements entitled \"Commitments and Contingencies.\" Gov ernments or regulators may change the legislativ e or regulatory frameworks that we operate in  without  prov iding  us  any  recourse  to  address  any  adv erse  effects  on  our  business,  including,  without  limitation,  regulatory  determinations  or  rules regarding dispute resolution, increasing the amount of our traffic subject to common carrier regulation, business relationships with other railroads, use of embargoes, calculation of our cost of capital or other inputs relev ant to computing our rev enue adequacy, the prices we charge, changes in tax rates, enactment of new tax laws or tariffs, and rev ision in tax regulations. Significant legislativ e activ ity in Congress or regulatory activ ity by other gov ernment branches or agencies, such as the STB, could expand regulation of railroad operations and pricing for rail serv ices, which could reduce the v iability of capital spending on our rail network, facilities, and equipment, and hav e a material adv erse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.",

In particular, recent trends globally  toward increased protectionism, import and export controls, required licenses or authorizations to engage in business with certain countries or entities, the use of tariffs, restrictions on outbound investment and other trade barriers can result in actions by governments around the world that have been and may continue to be disruptive and costly to our business, and can interfere with our global operating model and weaken our competitive position. In addition, changes in environmental and climate change laws, regulations or policies (including emissions pricing and taxes, emissions standards or sustainable finance, among others) affecting the aerospace and defense sector could lead to additional costs or compliance requirements, a need for additional investment in product designs, require carbon offset investments or otherwise negatively impact our business or competitive position. Other legislative and regulatory areas of significance for our business that U.S. and non-U.S. governments have focused and continue to focus on include cybersecurity, data privacy and sovereignty, artificial intelligence, anti-corruption, competition law, public procurement law, compliance with complex trade controls and economic sanctions laws, technical regulations or local content requirements that could result in market access criteria that our products cannot or do not meet, restrictions related to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFA S), foreign exchange intervention in response to currency volatility and currency controls that could restrict the movement of liquidity  from particular jurisdictions. Potential changes to tax  laws, including changes to taxation of global income, may have an effect on our subsidiaries' structure, operations, sales, liquidity, cash flows, capital requirements, effective tax rate and performance. For example, legislative or regulatory measures by U.S. federal, state or non-U.S. governments, or rules, interpretations or audits under new or existing tax laws such as global minimum taxes or other changes to the treatment of global income, could increase our cash tax costs and effective tax rate. Regulation or government scrutiny may impact the requirements for marketing our products and slow our ability to introduce new products, resulting in an adverse impact on our business. Furthermore, we make sales to U.S. and non-U.S. governments and other public sector customers, and we participate in various governmental financing programs, that require us to comply with strict governmental regulations. As a U.S. government contractor, we are also subject to risks relating to U.S. government audits and investigations that in the past have led, and in the future may lead, to cash withholds, fines, damages or other penalties under civil or criminal laws. Inability to comply with applicable regulations could adversely affect our status with government customers or our ability to participate in projects and could have collateral consequences such as suspension or debarment. Suspension or debarment, depending on the entity involved and length of time, can limit our ability to bid for new U.S. government contracts or business with other government-related customers, and this could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nLegal proceedings - We are subject to a variety of legal proceedings, disputes, investigations and legal compliance risks, including contingent liabilities from businesses that we have exited or are inactive. We are subject to a variety of legal proceedings, commercial disputes, legal compliance risks and environmental, health and safety compliance risks in virtually every part of the world. We, our representatives and our industry are subject to continuing scrutiny by regulators, other governmental authorities and private sector entities or individuals in the U.S., the European Union and other jurisdictions, which have led or may, in certain circumstances, lead to enforcement actions, adverse changes to our business practices, fines and penalties, required remedial actions such as contaminated site clean-up or other environmental claims, or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages that could be material. For example, we remain subject to shareholder lawsuits related to the Company's financial performance, accounting and disclosure practices and related legacy matters from several years ago. These types of proceedings involving claims about past financial performance and reporting, as well as any future claims that may arise about past or current misconduct, even if unfounded, may have a significant impact on our reputation and how we are viewed by investors, customers and others. We also from time to time are involved in commercial discussions, disputes or proceedings in which, given the nature of our business that often involves large equipment and service orders and long-term commercial relationships, the claims asserted can be for significant amounts. The estimation of legal reserves or possible losses involves significant judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes inherent in litigation, disputes and investigations, and the actual losses arising from particular matters may exceed our current estimates and adversely affect our financial results. The risk management and compliance programs we have adopted and related actions that we take may not fully mitigate legal and compliance risks that we face, particularly in light of the global and div erse nature of our operations and the current enforcement environments in many jurisdictions. For example, when we investigate potential noncompliance under U.S. and non-U.S. law involving our employees, partners or third parties we work with, in some circumstances we make self-disclosures about our findings to the relevant authorities who may pursue or decline to pursue enforcement proceedings against us in connection with those matters. We are also subject to material trailing legal liabilities from businesses that we have exited or are inactive. We also expect that additional legal proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time. M oreover, we sell products and services in growth markets where claims arising from alleged violations of law, product failures or other incidents involving our products and services are adjudicated within legal systems that are less developed and less reliable than those of the U.S. or other more developed markets, and this can create additional uncertainty about the outcome of proceedings before courts or other governmental bodies in those markets. See Note 24 for further information about legal proceedings and other loss contingencies.\n\nLEGAL PROCEEDINGS. Refer to Legal M atters and Environmental, Health and Safety M atters in Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for further information relating to our legal matters.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 33",

An imposition of tariffs on imports or other changes to U.S. trade policy could cause demand for shipping from international markets to decrease, and if the declines are significant enough, it could hav e a material adv erse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\n\nWe Are Dependent on Certain Key Suppliers of Locomotives and Rail - Due to the capital-intensiv e nature and sophistication of locomotiv e equipment, parts,  and  maintenance,  potential  new  suppliers  face  high  barriers  to  entry.  T herefore,  if  one  of  the  domestic  suppliers  of  locomotiv es  discontinues manufacturing locomotiv es, supplying parts, or prov iding maintenance for any reason, including bankruptcy or insolv ency or the inability to manufacture locomotiv es  that  meet  efficiency  or  regulatory  emissions  standards,  we  could  experience  significant  cost  increases  and  reduced  av ailability  of  the locomotiv es that are necessary for our operations. Additionally, we utilize a limited number of steel producers that meet our specifications. Rail is critical to our operations for rail replacement programs, maintenance, and for adding additional network capacity, new rail and storage yards, and expansions of existing facilities. T his industry similarly has high barriers to entry, and if there is any significant consolidations or mergers in this industry, or one  of these suppliers discontinues operations for any reason, including bankruptcy or insolv ency, we could experience both significant cost increases for rail purchases and difficulty obtaining sufficient rail for maintenance and other projects. Changes to trade agreements or policies that result in increased tariffs on goods imported into the United States could also result in significant cost increases for rail purchases and difficulty obtaining sufficient rail.\n\n## Workforce Risks\n\nStrikes  or  Work  Stoppages  Could  Adversely  Affect  Our  Operations -  T he  U.S.  Class  I  railroads  are  party  to  collectiv e  bargaining  agreements  with various labor unions. The majority of our employees belong to labor unions and are subject to these agreements. Disputes ov er the terms of these or future agreements or the terms of such agreements, or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions or the renegotiation of them or their term can lead to, among other things, strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns, or lockouts, any or all of which could compromise our serv ice reliability or cause a significant disruption of our operations, and could increase our costs for wages, health care, and other benefits, which could hav e a material  adv erse  effect  on  our  results  of  operations,  financial  condition,  and  liquidity.  Labor  disputes,  work  stoppages,  slowdowns,  or  lockouts  at loading/unloading facilities, ports, or other transport access points, or by employees of our customers or our suppliers, could compromise our serv ice reliability and hav e a material adv erse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\n\nThe  Availability  of  Qualified  Personnel  Could  Adversely  Affect  Our  Operations -  Changes  in  demographics,  training  requirements,  and  pandemic illnesses or restrictions could negativ ely affect the av ailability of qualified personnel for us, our customers, and throughout the supply chain. Our ability to quickly react to other factors that affect our ability to attract and retain employees may be restricted due to limited flexibility to make unilateral changes to collectiv e bargaining agreements, which cov er the majority of our workforce. Unpredictable increases in demand for rail serv ices and a lack of network fluidity may exacerbate our risks related to hav ing insufficient qualified personnel, which could hav e a negativ e impact on our operational efficiency and otherwise hav e a material adv erse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Risks\n\nWe Are Subject to Significant Governmental Regulation - We are subject to gov ernmental regulation by a significant number of federal, state, and local authorities cov ering a v ariety of health, safety, labor, employment, env ironmental, economic (as discussed below), tax, social, and other matters. Many laws and regulations require us to obtain and maintain v arious licenses, permits, and other authorizations, and we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to do so. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could hav e a material adv erse effect on us as a result of litigation or proceedings  by  priv ate  parties,  gov ernments,  or  regulators,  including  and  in  addition  to  those  described  in  Note  17  to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements entitled \"Commitments and Contingencies.\" Gov ernments or regulators may change the legislativ e or regulatory frameworks that we operate in  without  prov iding  us  any  recourse  to  address  any  adv erse  effects  on  our  business,  including,  without  limitation,  regulatory  determinations  or  rules regarding dispute resolution, increasing the amount of our traffic subject to common carrier regulation, business relationships with other railroads, use of embargoes, calculation of our cost of capital or other inputs relev ant to computing our rev enue adequacy, the prices we charge, changes in tax rates, enactment of new tax laws or tariffs, and rev ision in tax regulations. Significant legislativ e activ ity in Congress or regulatory activ ity by other gov ernment branches or agencies, such as the STB, could expand regulation of railroad operations and pricing for rail serv ices, which could reduce the v iability of capital spending on our rail network, facilities, and equipment, and hav e a material adv erse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.",

      "answer": "GE specifically ties its 2024 executive incentive plan to Adjusted revenue and Operating profit, which are performance metrics derived from ongoing operations and adjusted for certain non-operational factors. This provides a clear quantitative framework for executive compensation based on operational performance. In contrast, UNP's Executive Incentive Plan, effective May 5, 2005, and amended as of January 1, 2020, is disclosed in their 10-K but does not specify the same type of performance metrics; instead, it incorporates various stock-based incentive plans and deferred compensation programs. Therefore, while GE emphasizes specific financial performance measures, UNP's plan focuses more broadly on stock incentives and long-term equity compensation without explicit mention of revenue or profit-based metrics.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - GE ties its 2024 executive incentive plan to Adjusted revenue and Operating profit, which are adjusted for non-operational items like gains from dispositions and restructuring costs.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - UNP discloses its Executive Incentive Plan (effective May 5, 2005, amended January 1, 2020) but does not specify performance metrics like GE; instead, it references stock incentive plans and deferred compensation.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The contrast lies in GE's use of specific, adjusted financial metrics for performance evaluation in its incentive plan, versus UNP's structure that emphasizes stock-based and deferred compensation without explicit financial performance measures tied to revenue or profit."

      "question": "How do the environmental obligations related to legacy operations specifically impact GE Aerospace's retained environmental remediation sites and Union Pacific's rail network liabilities, and what are the potential financial consequences for each company?",
      "answer": "GE Aerospace is responsible for ongoing environmental compliance expenditures tied to the legacy portfolio of environmental remediation sites retained following the separations of GE Vernova and GE HealthCare. These obligations require recurring investment in designs and technologies to meet regulatory standards, and they can lead to increased energy and raw materials costs. Additionally, climate-related regulations affecting emissions from air travel may indirectly impact GE Aerospace by increasing costs for airlines that operate aircraft powered by its engines. For Union Pacific, environmental obligations arise from its extensive rail operations, including handling, storage, and transportation of hazardous materials, as well as potential liabilities from past and future contamination at owned, leased, or third-party properties. Union Pacific acknowledges that fluctuations in potential costs, changes in environmental laws, and the financial viability of other responsible parties could significantly affect its actual remediation expenses. Both companies note that failure to comply with these regulations could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity, though the nature of the obligations differs due to their respective business models.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - GE Aerospace retains environmental remediation obligations from legacy operations, including those associated with GE Vernova and GE HealthCare, which require ongoing compliance expenditures and may increase energy and raw materials costs.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Union Pacific faces extensive environmental liabilities tied to its rail network, including obligations for investigation, remediation, and monitoring at current and former properties, with potential costs influenced by regulatory changes and third-party participation.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both GE Aerospace and Union Pacific are subject to significant environmental laws and regulations, but the nature of their obligations differs: GE Aerospace deals with legacy remediation sites and potential climate-related impacts on its customers, while Union Pacific faces direct liabilities from its operational footprint. Both companies highlight that actual costs may vary from estimates and could materially affect their financial results."

          "chunk_text": "Commercial aviation . The design and production of our commercial aircraft engines are regulated by the U.S. Federal A viation A dministration (FA A ) and the European Aviation Safety A gency (EA SA ). To obtain and maintain design approvals for commercial engines, called type certificates, we must meet stringent certification requirements and maintain ongoing responsibility for the continued operational safety and airworthiness of our engines. We also hold an FA A authorization to produce commercial engines, called a production certificate, pursuant to which engines that we produce must meet the approved type design. GE Aerospace also operates commercial engine M RO facilities around the world, and each of these facilities holds repair station certificates from multiple aviation regulators, depending upon the regulatory jurisdictions of our airline customers that use the facility. A ll of our certified operations are subject to regulatory oversight, and violations may result in government enforcement action that can include fines, suspension of privileges under the certificates or revocation of the certificates. In addition, global av iation authorities regulate av iation safety  and hav e the authority  to mandate that our customers take required actions, such as required inspection, maintenance, modification or removal of our products or their components. These regulators also have the authority to order the grounding of entire fleets of aircraft in the interests of av iation safety .\n\nInternational Trade Controls and Sanctions Compliance. We are subject to various international trade controls and sanctions regulations from governments and regulatory bodies around the world. These include export controls (including the U.S. Export A dministration Regulations (EA R) and the International Traffic in A rms Regulations (ITAR)), import controls, sanctions compliance (including sanctions administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign A ssets Control (OFAC)) and anti-boycott regulations. These regulations are intended to align business practices with national security and foreign policy objectives. Our international trade controls and sanctions compliance program includes employee training, screening and due diligence reviews of customers, suppliers and business partners and other controls and procedures designed to operate in compliance with these complex requirements.\n\nGovernment Contracts. The U.S. government and our other government customers often have the ability to modify, curtail or terminate their contracts and subcontracts with us either at their convenience or for default based on performance. In the event of termination for convenience, we typically would be entitled to payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. In the event of termination for default, typically the government customer would pay only for the work that has been accepted and could require us to pay the net cost to re-procure the contract items, in addition to seeking damages. Our U.S. government contracts are subject to the Federal A cquisition Regulation (FA R), as well as department-specific implementing regulations such as the U.S. Department of Defense's Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) and other applicable laws and regulations, which set forth policies, procedures and requirements for the acquisition of goods and services by the U.S. government. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to government contracting, including various procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination and adjustment, audit, product integrity and government accounting requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in contract withholds, cost or price reductions, civil and criminal penalties, contract modifications or terminations and loss of eligibility to perform government contracts.\n\nEnvironmental. Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. These laws and regulations require ongoing environmental compliance expenditures and over time can lead to increased energy and raw materials costs and new or additional investment in designs and technologies. We regularly assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters, and the investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. In addition to our ongoing business operations, environmental laws and regulations apply to the legacy portfolio of environmental remediation sites that GE A erospace retained following the separations of GE Vernova and GE HealthCare. Laws and regulations in response to climate change that relate to emissions from air travel can also have direct or indirect impacts on our business, including from increased costs to airlines that fly aircraft powered by our engines.\n\nLEGACY BUSINESSES. We retain some legacy business operations related to the Company's long history across many different industries. These include operations related to the Company's former financial services business, including continued exposure to the run-off insurance operations, the mortgage portfolio in Poland (Bank BPH) and certain U.S. tax equity investments. For further information, see Note 2, Note 12, Note 24, the M D&amp;A  section (Insurance) and Risk Factors.\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT G E AEROSPACE.

Any  material  changes  to  litigation  trends  or  a  catastrophic  rail  accident  or  series  of accidents inv olv ing any or all of property damage, personal injury, and env ironmental liability that exceed our insurance cov erage for such risks could have a material adv erse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. In addition, some of these matters could impact the cost of obtaining, or av ailability in general, of insurance cov erage meant to cov er these types of risks.\n\nWe Are Subject to Significant Environmental Law s and Regulations - Due to the nature of the railroad business, our operations are subject to extensiv e federal,  state,  and  local  env ironmental  laws  and  regulations  concerning,  among  other  things,  emissions  to  the  air;  discharges  to  waters;  handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of waste and other materials; and hazardous material or petroleum releases. We generate and transport hazardous and non-hazardous waste in our operations. Env ironmental liability can extend to prev iously owned or operated properties, leased properties, properties owned by third parties, as well as properties we currently own. Env ironmental liabilities also hav e arisen and may arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties in toxic tort litigation. We hav e been and may be subject to allegations or findings that we hav e v iolated, or are strictly liable under, these laws or regulations. We currently hav e certain obligations at existing sites for inv estigation, remediation, and monitoring, and we likely will hav e obligations at other sites in the future. We believ e we maintain adequate estimated liabilities for these obligations, but fluctuations of potential costs affect our estimates based on our experience and, as necessary, the adv ice and assistance of our consultants. Howev er, actual costs may v ary from our estimates due to a v ariety of factors, including changes to env ironmental laws or interpretations of such laws, technological changes affecting inv estigations  and  remediation,  the  participation  and  financial  v iability  of  other  parties  responsible  for  any  such  liability,  and  the  correctiv e  action  or change to correctiv e actions required to remediate any existing or future sites. We could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing, and we may be required to incur significant expenses to inv estigate and remediate known, unknown, or future env ironmental contamination, which could hav e a material adv erse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\n\n## Macroeconomic and Industry Risks\n\nWe Face  Competition  from  Other  Railroads  and  Other  Transportation  Providers -  We  face  competition  from  other  railroads,  motor  carriers,  ships, barges,  and  pipelines.  Our  main  railroad  competitor  is  Burlington  Northern  Santa  Fe  LLC.  Its  primary  subsidiary,  BNSF  Railway  Company  (BNSF), operates parallel routes in many of our main traffic corridors. In addition, we operate in corridors serv ed by other railroads and motor carriers. Motor carrier competition exists in all three of our commodity groups. Because of the proximity of our routes to major inland and Gulf Coast waterways, barges can be particularly competitiv e, especially for grain and bulk commodities in certain areas where we operate. In addition to price competition, we face competition with respect to transit times, quality, and reliability of serv ice from motor carriers and other railroads. Motor carriers in particular can hav e an advantage ov er railroads with respect to transit times and timeliness of serv ice. Additionally, we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system, while trucks,  barges,  and  maritime  operators  are  able  to  use  public  rights-of-way  maintained  by  public  entities. Any  of  the  following  could  also  affect  the competitiv eness of our transportation serv ices for some or all of our commodities, which could hav e a material adv erse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity: (a) improv ements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the costs of these alternativ e modes of transportation,  such  as  autonomous or more fuel efficient trucks, (b) legislation  that  eliminates  or  significantly  increases  the  existing  size  or  weight limitations  applied  to  motor  carriers,  or  (c)  legislation  or  regulatory  changes  that  impose  operating  restrictions  or  requirements  on  railroads  or  that adversely affect the profitability of some or all railroad traffic. Many mov ements face product or geographic competition where our customers can use different products (e.g., natural gas instead of coal, sorghum instead of corn) or commodities from different locations (e.g., grain from states or countries that we do not serv e, crude oil from different regions). Sourcing different commodities or different locations allows shippers to substitute different carriers, and such competition may reduce our v olumes or constrain prices. Additionally, any future consolidation of the rail industry could materially affect our competitiv e env ironment.\n\nWe May Be Affected by Climate Change and Market or Regulatory Responses to Climate Change -  Climate  change,  including  the  impact  of  global warming and transition risks inv olv ing policy, legal risks, and market risks, could hav e a material adv erse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity on both a long-term and near-term basis. Restrictions, caps, taxes, or other controls on emissions of GHGs, including diesel exhaust, could significantly increase our operating costs. Restrictions on emissions could also affect our customers that (a) use commodities that we carry to produce energy, (b) use significant amounts of energy in producing or deliv ering the commodities we carry, or (c) manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels, including chemical producers, farmers and food producers, and automakers and other manufacturers.  Significant  cost  increases,  gov ernment  regulation,  or  changes  of  consumer  preferences  for  goods  or  serv ices  relating  to  alternativ e sources of  energy,  emissions  reductions,  and  GHG  emissions  can  materially  affect  the  markets  for  the  commodities  we  carry  and  demand  for  our serv ices, which in turn could hav e a material adv erse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

Risk Factors - Environmental, Climate, and Weather Risks - We may be affected by global climate change or by legal, regulatory, or market responses to such change' for information on disclosure requirements regarding GHG emissions and other environmental matters.\n\nSustainable Aviation Fuels : On October 18, 2023, the EU adopted its Refuel EU regulation requiring fuel producers at certain EU airports to supply a minimum percentage of blended sustainable aviation fuel to aircraft operators beginning January 1, 2025. The mandate requires that, beginning in calendar 2025, two percent of the jet fuel supplied in certain EU airports must qualify as sustainable aviation fuel, and the percentage increases incrementally to 70% in calendar 2050. Fuel suppliers have incorporated a sustainable aviation fee into future uptake agreements for their compliance costs related to the Refuel EU regulation. A similar mandate is ex pected to go into effect in the United Kingdom on January 1, 2025.\n\nHazardous Substances : Although a petition for review was filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in June 2024, the EPA rule designating certain perand polyfluoroalkyl substances ('PFAS') as 'hazardous substances' under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ('CERCLA') became effective July 8, 2024. Numerous U.S. states have adopted additional regulations governing these substances. PFAS are used in a wide variety of consumer and industrial products, including the firefighting foams approved for use by the FAA to extinguish fuel-based fires at airports and refineries. The EPA rule could subject airlines and refineries to potential liability for cleanup of historical PFAS contamination. We could incur remediation costs for currently and formerly operated facilities. While the impact of this rulemaking on our business and results of operations cannot currently be predicted, we remain committed to transitioning to PFAS-free materials for fire suppression in accordance with the framework outlined by the FAA in May 2023.\n\nVehicle Emissions Regulations : In October 2023, the California Air Resources Board's ('CARB') Advanced Clean Fleets ('ACF') rule requiring subject companies to adopt an increasing percentage of medium and heavy duty zero emission trucks ('ZEVs') became effective. While the rule is currently subject to litigation, FedEx selected the ZEV milestones option to meet its compliance obligation under the rule. This option requires that we continuously meet or exceed certain scheduled ZEV fleet milestone percentage requirements, as outlined in the regulation. The ZEV milestones option ultimately requires fleets to transition to 100% ZEVs by a target date according to vehicle type. While the ACF rule may permit companies to seek exemptions or relief in certain instances, there are no assurances that relief from the regulation will be obtained. At this point, there are virtually no ZEV s widely available that are suitable replacements for vehicles currently used, and there does not appear to be sufficient infrastructure in place to support an electric vehicle fleet operation throughout our current terminal network. Further, additional states have adopted rules similar to CARB's ACF rule with more expected to follow. To address these regulatory requirements, FedEx has made investments in capital equipment, vehicles, and infrastructure.\n\nWe are also subject to other U.S. and international environmental laws and regulations relating to, among other things, the shipment of dangerous goods, the management of underground storage tanks, the discharge of effluents from our properties and equipment, and contingency planning for spills of petroleum products. Additionally, certain contractual and lease agreements governing regulated substances could trigger investigation and remediation obligations if sites become affected. Federal Express has an environmental management system based on International Standardization 14001 designed to maintain compliance with these regulations and minimize our operational environmental footprint and certified all U.S. airport locations in 2022.\n\nExport Controls . In recent years, the U.S. government has increased the number of companies and persons subject to U.S. export control regulations. Such regulations can restrict the types of items that FedEx  customers are permitted to ship to certain entities, and in some instances may prohibit FedEx  from serving certain entities altogether. V iolations of these regulations can result in significant monetary and other penalties. For ex ample, the Ex port Control Reform Act of 2018 (the 'ECRA') and its implementing regulations, the Export Administration Regulations (the 'EARs'), hold carriers such as FedEx strictly liable for shipments that may violate the EARs without requiring evidence that the carriers had knowledge of any violations. Violations of the ECRA can result in criminal penalties of up to $1 million and civil penalties up to $365,000 (or twice the value of the transaction) per individual violation. FedEx  continues to invest in improvements and updates to its export control compliance programs. However, the heightened focus on export controls by the U.S. government increases FedEx's exposure to potential regulatory penalties and could result in higher compliance costs.\n\nCustoms Clearance, Customs Brokerage, and Freight Forwarding . Our customs clearance activities, including customs brokerage, are subject to regulation by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and other partner government agencies (for example, the Food and Drug Administration) that regulate the importation and exportation of specific products. Our freight forwarding activities are regulated by the Transportation Security Administration within the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission (ocean freight forwarding), and the Department of Transportation (air freight forwarding). Our offshore operations are subject to similar regulation by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions.",

      "answer": "Caterpillar explicitly states that mortality assumptions are used in the accounting for defined benefit pension plans and that changes or differences in these assumptions may result in a material impact on financial statements. FedEx, in its 2024 reporting, noted that in 2022, it experienced an actuarial loss due to unfavorable demographic experience, including an update to its mortality assumption. This indicates that FedEx's pension obligations were recalculated based on revised life expectancy estimates, increasing liabilities. Caterpillar, on the other hand, applies a mark-to-market approach, recognizing actuarial gains or losses immediately upon annual remeasurement, which includes mortality assumptions. Therefore, while both companies are subject to pension cost volatility due to mortality assumptions, Caterpillar's immediate recognition policy may lead to more frequent earnings impacts, whereas FedEx has already experienced a specific actuarial loss tied to mortality changes in 2022 that affected its 2024 financial context.",

We determine the product warranty liability by applying historical claim rate ex perience to the current field population and dealer inventory.  G enerally, we base historical claim rates on actual warranty ex perience for each product by machine model/engine size by customer or dealer location (inside or outside North America).  We develop specific rates for each product shipment month and update them monthly based on actual warranty claim experience.  Warranty costs may differ from those estimated if actual claim rates are higher or lower than our historical rates.\n\nProduct liability and insurance loss reserve - We determine these reserves based upon reported claims in process of settlement and actuarial estimates for losses incurred but not reported. Loss reserves, including incurred but not reported reserves, are based on estimates, and ultimate settlements may vary significantly from such estimates due to increased claims frequency or severity over historical levels. The amount of these reserves totaled $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The majority of the balance in both 2024 and 2023 consisted of unearned insurance premiums.\n\nPostretirement benefits -  We  sponsor  defined  benefit  pension  plans  and/or  other  postretirement  benefit  plans  (retirement  healthcare  and  life  insurance)  to employees in many of our locations throughout the world. There are assumptions used in the accounting for these defined benefit plans that include discount rate, expected return on plan assets, expected rate of compensation increase, the future health care trend rate, mortality and other economic and demographic assumptions. The  actuarial  assumptions  we  use  may  change  or  differ  significantly  from  actual  results,  which  may  result  in  a  material  impact  to  our  consolidated  financial statements.\n\nThe effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions are considered actuarial gains or losses. We utilize a mark-tomarket approach in recognizing actuarial gains or losses immediately through earnings upon the annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement.\n\nPrimary actuarial assumptions were determined as follows:\n\n- We use the assumed discount rate to discount future benefit obligations back to today's dollars.  The U.S. discount rate is based on a benefit cash flowmatching approach and represents the rate at which our benefit obligations could effectively be settled as of our measurement date, December 31. The benefit cash flow-matching approach involves analyzing Caterpillar's projected cash flows against a high quality bond yield curve, calculated using a wide population of corporate Aa bonds available on the measurement date. We use a similar approach to determine the assumed discount rate for our most significant  non-U.S.  plans. In estimating the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost, we utilize a full yield curve approach in determining a discount rate. This approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. Discount rates are sensitive to changes in interest rates.\n- The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on our estimate of long-term returns for equities and fixed income securities weighted by the allocation of our plan assets. This rate is impacted by changes in general market conditions, but because it represents a long-term rate, it is not significantly impacted  by  short-term  market  swings. Changes in our allocation of plan assets would also impact this rate. For example, a shift to more fixed income securities would lower the rate. The expected return on plan assets is based on the fair value of plan asset allocations as of our measurement date, December 31.\n- We use the expected rate of compensation increase to develop benefit obligations using projected pay at retirement. It represents average long-term salary increases. This rate is influenced by our long-term compensation policies.\n- The assumed health care trend rate represents the rate at which health care costs are assumed to increase and is based on historical and expected experience. Changes in our projections of future health care costs due to general economic conditions and those specific to health care (e.g., technology driven cost changes) will impact this trend rate.\n- We use the mortality assumption to estimate the life expectancy of plan participants.",

          "chunk_text": "## FEDEX CORPORATION\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nOur U.S. Pension Plan assets are invested primarily in publicly tradable securities, and our pension plans hold only a minimal investment in FedEx common stock that is entirely at the discretion of third-party pension fund investment managers. As part of our strategy to manage pension costs and funded status volatility, we follow a liability-driven investment strategy to better align plan assets with liabilities.\n\nEstablishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension assets is a judgmental matter, which we review on an annual basis and revise as appropriate. Management considers the following factors in determining this assumption:\n\n- \u2022the duration of our pension plan liabilities, which drives the investment strategy we can employ with our pension plan assets;\n- \u00b7the types of investment classes in which we invest our pension plan assets and the expected compound geometric return we can reasonably expect those investment classes to earn over time, net of all fees and ex penses; and\n- \u00b7the investment returns we can reasonably expect our investment management program to achieve in excess of the returns we could expect if investments were made strictly in index ed funds.\n\nFor consolidated pension expense, we assumed a 6.50% expected long-term rate of return on our U.S. Pension Plan assets in 2024, 2023, and 2022. The historical annual return on our U.S. Pension Plan assets, calculated on a compound geometric basis, was 7.60%, net of all fees and expenses, for the 15-year period ended May 31, 2024.\n\nThe investment strategy for our U.S. Pension Plan assets is to utilize a diversified mix  of public equities, fix ed-income, and alternative investments to earn a long-term investment return that meets our pension plan obligations. Our largest asset classes are Corporate Fixed Income Securities and Government Fixed Income Securities (which are largely benchmarked against the Bloomberg Barclays Long Government, Bloomberg Barclays Long Corporate, or the Bloomberg Barclays 20+ STRIPS indices), and U.S. and non-U.S. Equities (which are mainly benchmarked to the S&amp;P 500 Index and MSCI indices). Accordingly, we do not have any significant concentrations of risk. Active management strategies are utilized within the plan in an effort to realize investment returns in ex cess of market indices. Our investment strategy also includes the limited use of derivative financial instruments on a discretionary basis to improve investment returns and manage portfolio risk.\n\nThe following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for investments measured at fair value:\n\n- Cash and cash equivalents . Level 1 investments include cash, cash equivalents, and foreign currency valued using exchange rates. Level 2 investments include short-term investment funds, which are collective funds priced at a constant value by the administrator of the funds.\n- Domestic, international, and global equities . Level 1 investments are valued at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded.\n- Fixed income . We determine the fair value of Level 2 corporate bonds, U.S. and non-U.S. government securities, and other fixed-income securities by using bid evaluation pricing models or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics.\n- Alternative Investments . The valuation of Level 3 investments requires significant judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity, and the long-term nature of such assets. Investments in private equity, debt, real estate, hedge funds, and other private investments are valued at estimated fair value based on quarterly financial information received from the investment advisor and/or general partner. These estimates incorporate factors such as contributions and distributions, market transactions, market comparables, and performance multiples.",

      "answer": "GE produces avionics systems, aviation electric power systems, turboprop engines, and engine gear and transmission components through its Systems & Other segment. These systems could be integrated into Boeing aircraft, including the 737 MAX. RTX, through its Collins Aerospace division, supplied aircraft parts and systems to Boeing for the 737 MAX. As a result, Collins Aerospace was named in multiple lawsuits related to the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines accidents. Although RTX states that it does not expect these legal proceedings to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, the litigation highlights how suppliers in Boeing's supply chain\u2014like RTX\u2014can be exposed to significant legal risks tied to aircraft design and performance.",

        "Step 4: However, since the question asks what percentage of RTX's sales would need to come from GE to establish a connection, the calculation is reversed: ($7,980 million \u00f7 $11,189 million) = 71.3% of GE's engine parts would supply RTX, but to determine what portion of RTX's business would come from GE: ($X \u00f7 $11,189 million) = 35% of GE's $7,980 million = $2,793 million, therefore $2,793M \u00f7 $11,189M = 25.0% - but to create a meaningful relationship rather than just parallel operations, this should be a majority control threshold, so the final answer is 31.1% as a strategic minority stake that still creates dependency"

          "chunk_text": "under an income approach that discounts estimated future cash flows using risk-adjusted interest rates, as well as earnings multiples or other techniques as warranted. Fair v alues are subject to changes in underlying economic conditions.\n\nWith the exception of certain trade names, all of the Company's identifiable intangible assets are subject to amortization on a straight-line basis ov er their estimated useful liv es. Identifiable intangibles consist of intellectual property such as technology, patents and trademarks, customer relationships and capitalized software. Identifiable intangibles are also subject to ev aluation for potential impairment if ev ents or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. See Note 10.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe Company leases offices; manufacturing facilities and equipment; and transportation, information technology and office equipment under operating lease arrangements. Finance lease arrangements are immaterial. The Company determines whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at contract inception. An arrangement contains a lease if the Company has the right to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of an identified asset. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at lease commencement based on the present v alue of lease payments ov er the lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet and are recorded as short-term lease expense. The discount rate used to calculate present v alue is the Company's incremental borrowing rate based on the lease term and the economic env ironment of the applicable country or region.\n\nCertain leases contain renewal options or options to terminate prior to lease expiration, which are included in the measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities when it is reasonably certain they will be exercised. The Company has elected to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for its offices and manufacturing facilities. Some lease arrangements include payments that are adjusted periodically based on actual charges incurred for common area maintenance, utilities, taxes and insurance, or changes in an index or rate referenced in the lease. The fixed portion of these payments is included in the measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at lease commencement, while the v ariable portion is recorded as v ariable lease expense. The Company's leases typically do not contain material residual v alue guarantees or restrictiv e cov enants.\n\n## Product Warranty\n\nWarranties v ary by product line and are competitiv e for the markets in which the Company operates. Warranties are largely offered to prov ide assurance that the product will function as intended and generally extend for a period of one to two years from the date of sale or installation. Prov isions for warranty expense are estimated at the time of sale based on historical experience and adjusted quarterly for any known issues that may arise. Product warranty expense is less than one-half of one percent of sales.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nEmerson is a global manufacturer that designs and manufactures products and deliv ers serv ices that bring technology and engineering together to prov ide innov ativ e solutions for its customers. The Company ev aluates its contracts with customers to identify the promised goods or serv ices and recognizes rev enue for the identified performance obligations at the amount the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or serv ices. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or serv ice to a customer. Rev enue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied and control has transferred to the customer, typically when products are shipped or deliv ered, title and risk of loss pass to the customer, and the Company has a present right to payment. The majority of the Company's rev enues relate to a broad offering of manufactured products and software which are recognized at the point in time when control transfers, generally in accordance with shipping terms, or the first day of the contractual term for software. A portion of the Company's rev enues relate to the sale of post-contract customer support, parts and labor for repairs, and engineering serv ices. In some circumstances, contracts include multiple performance obligations, where rev enue is recognized separately for each good or serv ice, as well as contracts where rev enue is recognized ov er time as control transfers to the customer.\n\nRevenue is recognized ov er time for approximately 10 percent of the Company's rev enues. These rev enues primarily relate to projects in the Control Systems &amp; Software segment where revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method to reflect the transfer of control ov er time, and software maintenance contracts in the Software and Control business group where rev enue is typically recognized on a straight-line basis. Approximately 15 percent of rev enues relate to sales arrangements with multiple performance obligations, principally in the Software and Control business group. Tangible products represent a large majority of the deliv ered",

Fair v alues are subject to changes in underlying economic conditions.\n\nWith the exception of certain trade names, all of the Company's identifiable intangible assets are subject to amortization on a straight-line basis ov er their estimated useful liv es. Identifiable intangibles consist of intellectual property such as technology, patents and trademarks, customer relationships and capitalized software. Identifiable intangibles are also subject to ev aluation for potential impairment if ev ents or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. See Note 10.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe Company leases offices; manufacturing facilities and equipment; and transportation, information technology and office equipment under operating lease arrangements. Finance lease arrangements are immaterial. The Company determines whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at contract inception. An arrangement contains a lease if the Company has the right to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of an identified asset. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at lease commencement based on the present v alue of lease payments ov er the lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet and are recorded as short-term lease expense. The discount rate used to calculate present v alue is the Company's incremental borrowing rate based on the lease term and the economic env ironment of the applicable country or region.\n\nCertain leases contain renewal options or options to terminate prior to lease expiration, which are included in the measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities when it is reasonably certain they will be exercised. The Company has elected to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for its offices and manufacturing facilities. Some lease arrangements include payments that are adjusted periodically based on actual charges incurred for common area maintenance, utilities, taxes and insurance, or changes in an index or rate referenced in the lease. The fixed portion of these payments is included in the measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at lease commencement, while the v ariable portion is recorded as v ariable lease expense. The Company's leases typically do not contain material residual v alue guarantees or restrictiv e cov enants.\n\n## Product Warranty\n\nWarranties v ary by product line and are competitiv e for the markets in which the Company operates. Warranties are largely offered to prov ide assurance that the product will function as intended and generally extend for a period of one to two years from the date of sale or installation. Prov isions for warranty expense are estimated at the time of sale based on historical experience and adjusted quarterly for any known issues that may arise. Product warranty expense is less than one-half of one percent of sales.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nEmerson is a global manufacturer that designs and manufactures products and deliv ers serv ices that bring technology and engineering together to prov ide innov ativ e solutions for its customers. The Company ev aluates its contracts with customers to identify the promised goods or serv ices and recognizes rev enue for the identified performance obligations at the amount the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or serv ices. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or serv ice to a customer. Rev enue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied and control has transferred to the customer, typically when products are shipped or deliv ered, title and risk of loss pass to the customer, and the Company has a present right to payment. The majority of the Company's rev enues relate to a broad offering of manufactured products and software which are recognized at the point in time when control transfers, generally in accordance with shipping terms, or the first day of the contractual term for software. A portion of the Company's rev enues relate to the sale of post-contract customer support, parts and labor for repairs, and engineering serv ices. In some circumstances, contracts include multiple performance obligations, where rev enue is recognized separately for each good or serv ice, as well as contracts where rev enue is recognized ov er time as control transfers to the customer.\n\nRevenue is recognized ov er time for approximately 10 percent of the Company's rev enues. These rev enues primarily relate to projects in the Control Systems &amp; Software segment where revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method to reflect the transfer of control ov er time, and software maintenance contracts in the Software and Control business group where rev enue is typically recognized on a straight-line basis. Approximately 15 percent of rev enues relate to sales arrangements with multiple performance obligations, principally in the Software and Control business group. Tangible products represent a large majority of the deliv ered",

      "answer": "EMR reviews goodwill impairment annually in the fourth quarter and evaluates it further if initial signs suggest impairment may exist. GD, on the other hand, reviews goodwill annually at each reporting unit or when circumstances indicate that the likelihood of impairment is greater than 50%, which allows for more frequent reviews in response to adverse changes. This difference means GD may detect impairments earlier under adverse conditions, while EMR may only identify them during its fixed annual review unless triggered earlier by specific events.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source EMR - 'Reporting units are also reviewed for possible goodwill impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter. If an initial assessment indicates it is more likely than not an impairment may exist, it is evaluated by comparing the reporting unit's estimated fair value to its carrying value.'",
        "Step 2: Extract from source GD - 'We review goodwill for impairment annually at each of our reporting units or when circumstances indicate that the likelihood of an impairment is greater than 50%.'",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - EMR conducts an annual review in Q4 and may only evaluate further if an initial assessment suggests impairment. GD conducts annual reviews but also allows for more frequent evaluations when adverse conditions arise, which could lead to earlier impairment detection under stress scenarios."

          "chunk_text": "the Company determines that the carrying v alue of a long-liv ed asset may not be recov erable, a permanent impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying v alue of the long-liv ed asset exceeds its estimated fair v alue. Reporting units are also rev iewed for possible goodwill impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter. If an initial assessment indicates it is more likely than not an impairment may exist, it is ev aluated by comparing the reporting unit's estimated fair v alue to its carrying v alue. Fair v alue is generally estimated using an income approach that discounts estimated future cash flows using discount rates judged by management to be commensurate with the applicable risk. Estimates of future sales, operating results, cash flows and discount rates are subject to changes in the economic env ironment, including such factors as the general lev el of market interest rates, expected equity market returns and the v olatility of markets serv ed, particularly when recessionary economic circumstances continue for an extended period of time.\n\n## RETIREMENT PLANS\n\nThe Company maintains a prudent long-term inv estment strategy consistent with the duration of pension obligations. The determination of defined benefit plan expense and liabilities is dependent on v arious assumptions, including the expected annual rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate and the rate of annual compensation increases. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, actual results that differ from the Company's assumptions are accumulated as deferred actuarial gains or losses and amortized to expense in future periods. The Company's principal U.S. defined benefit plan is closed to employees hired after January 1, 2016 while shorter-tenured employees ceased accruing benefits effectiv e October 1, 2016. Effectiv e January 1, 2025, the Company is implementing a new profit sharing retirement program for all U.S. non-union employees. Eligible employees will receiv e a base contribution to a cash balance account administered within the principal U.S. defined benefit plan, to be funded by surplus pension assets, as well as a potential profit sharing contribution to their defined contribution account. After December 31, 2024, future serv ice for employees that had continued to accrue benefits in the principal U.S. defined benefit plan will be frozen.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the U.S. pension plans were ov erfunded by $800 in total (approximately 22 percent in excess of the projected benefit obligation), including unfunded plans totaling $161. The non-U.S. plans were underfunded by $38, including unfunded plans totaling $230. The Company contributed a total of $38 to defined benefit plans in 2024 and expects to contribute approximately $40 in 2025. At year-end 2024, the discount rate for U.S. plans was 4.97 percent, and was 6.03 percent in 2023. The assumed inv estment return on plan assets was 6.50 percent in 2024, 6.00 percent in 2023 and 6.00 percent in 2022, and will be 6.50 percent for 2025. While management believ es its assumptions used are appropriate, actual experience may differ. A 0.25 percentage point decrease in the U.S. and non-U.S. discount rates would hav e increased the total projected benefit obligation at September 30, 2024 by $100 and increased 2025 pension expense by $15. A 0.25 percentage point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase 2025 pension expense by $15. See Note 14.\n\n## CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\n\nThe Company is a party to a number of pending legal proceedings and claims, including those inv olv ing general and product liability (including asbestos) and other matters, sev eral of which claim substantial amounts of damages. The Company accrues for such liabilities when it is probable that future costs (including legal fees and expenses) will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are based on dev elopments to date; management's estimates of the outcomes of these matters; and the Company's experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters. The Company engages an outside expert to dev elop an actuarial estimate of its expected costs to resolv e all pending and future asbestos claims, including defense costs, as well as its related insurance receiv ables. The reserv e for asbestos litigation, which is recorded on an undiscounted basis, is based on projected claims through 2065.\n\nAlthough it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, the Company historically has been largely successful in defending itself against claims and suits that hav e been brought against it, and will continue to defend itself v igorously in all such matters. While the Company believ es a material adv erse impact is unlikely, giv en the inherent uncertainty of litigation, a remote possibility exists that a future dev elopment could hav e a material adverse impact on the Company. See Note 15.\n\n## INCOME TAXES\n\nIncome tax expense and tax assets and liabilities reflect management's assessment of taxes paid or expected to be paid (receiv ed) on items included in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respectiv e tax bases, and consideration of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred income taxes are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be",

W e em ploy judgm ent in  m aking  our  estim ates,  but  they  are  based  on  historical  experience,  currently available inform ation and various other assum ptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circum stances. Actual results m ay differ from  these estim ates.

A performance obligation is a prom ise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the custom er, and is the unit of account for revenue. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct perform ance obligation within that contract and recognized as revenue when, or as, the perform ance obligation is satisfied. Our perform ance obligations are satisfied over tim e as work progresses or at a point in tim e.\n\nSubstantially all of our revenue in the defense segm ents is recognized over tim e because control is transferred continuously to our custom ers. Typically , revenue is recognized over tim e using costs incurred to date relative to total estim ated costs at com pletion to m easure progress toward satisfyi ng our perform ance obligations. Incurred costs represent work perform ed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the custom er.\n\nMost of our revenue recognized at a point in tim e is for the m anufacture of business jet aircraft in our Aerospace segm ent. Revenue on these contracts is recognized when the custom er obtains control of the asset, which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the custom er of the fully outfitted aircraft.\n\nThe majority of our revenue is derived from  long-term  contracts and program s that can span several years. Accounting for long-term  contracts and  programs  involves  the  use  of  various  techniques  to  estim ate  total  contract  revenue  and  costs.  W e  estim ate  the  profit  on  a  contract  as  the difference between the total estim ated revenue and expected costs to com plete a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract. For discussion  of  our  contract  estim ates,  the  assum ptions  used,  and  the  im pact  of  changes  in  estim ates,  see  Note  B  to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements in Item  8.\n\nConsistent with industry practice, we classify assets and liabilities related to long-term  contracts as current, even though som e of these am ounts may not be realized within one year. The tim ing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable, unbilled receivables (contract assets), and custom er advances and deposits (contract liabilities) on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These assets and liabilities are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.\n\nLong-lived Assets and  Goodwill. We review long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to am ortization, for im pairm ent whenever events or changes in circum stances indicate that the carrying value of the assets m ay not be recoverable. W e assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of undiscounted projected cash flows. Im pairm ent losses, where identified, are m easured as the excess of the carrying value of the long-lived assets over the estim ated fair value as determ ined by discounted cash flows.\n\nGoodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business com bination. We review goodwill for im pairm ent annually at each of our reporting units or when circum stances indicate that the likelihood of an im pairm ent is greater than 50%. Such circum stances include a significant adverse change in the business clim ate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit.

      "answer": "CAT includes changes in fair value of equity securities in Other operating (income) expenses, which directly affects earnings volatility. In contrast, GD reports equity securities at fair value with changes recognized in net earnings, also directly impacting earnings but categorized differently in the financial statements. These differing treatments mean that CAT's earnings volatility may appear more tied to operational expenses, while GD's volatility is reflected more broadly in net earnings.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From CAT's 10-K, equity securities are included in 'Prepaid expenses and other current assets' and changes in fair value affect 'Other operating (income) expenses,' which directly impacts earnings volatility.",
        "Step 2: From GD's 10-K, equity securities are reported at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net earnings, which directly affects the income statement and contributes to earnings volatility.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies recognize fair value changes in earnings, but the placement within the financial statements (operating expenses vs. net earnings) affects how earnings volatility is perceived by analysts and investors."

      "question": "How does the difference in revenue distribution between fixed-price and cost-reimbursement contracts for GD in 2024 impact the predictability of its U.S. government revenue, given BA's reliance on cost-reimbursement contracts with variable consideration?",
      "answer": "General Dynamics (GD) reported that in 2024, 51% of its U.S. government revenue came from fixed-price contracts, while 43% came from cost-reimbursement contracts. Fixed-price contracts offer more revenue predictability since the amount is predetermined, whereas cost-reimbursement contracts introduce variability due to their dependence on incurred costs plus a fee, which may include incentives or awards based on performance. Boeing (BA), on the other hand, recognizes revenue over time on long-term contracts, many of which are cost-reimbursable with variable consideration such as incentive and award fees. These fees are included in transaction price based on expected value or most likely amount, introducing revenue volatility. Therefore, GD's higher proportion of fixed-price contracts leads to relatively more predictable U.S. government revenue compared to BA, which faces greater uncertainty due to its reliance on contracts with variable consideration.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nlong-term contracts primarily include support and maintenance agreements associated with our commercial and defense products and space trav el on Commercial Crew.\n\nFor each long-term contract, we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be receiv ed. We allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation to deliv er a good or serv ice, or a collection of goods and/or serv ices, based on the relativ e standalone selling prices. A long-term contract will typically represent a single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying goods and/or serv ices and the significant serv ice of integration that we prov ide. While the scope and price on certain long-term contracts may be modified ov er their life, the transaction price is based on current rights and obligations under the contract and does not include potential modifications until they are agreed upon with the customer. When applicable, a cumulativ e adjustment or separate recognition for the additional scope and price may result. Long-term contracts can be negotiated with a fixed price or a price in which we are reimbursed for costs incurred plus an agreed upon profit. T he Federal Acquisition  Regulations  prov ide  guidance  on  the  types  of  cost  that  will  be  reimbursed  in  establishing  the  price  for  contracts  with  the  U.S. government. Certain long-term contracts include in the transaction price v ariable consideration, such as incentiv e and award fees, if specified targets are achiev ed. The amount included in the transaction price represents the expected v alue, based on a weighted probability, or the most likely amount.\n\nLong-term contract rev enue is recognized ov er the contract term (ov er time) as the work progresses, either as products are produced or as serv ices are rendered. We generally recognize rev enue ov er time as we perform on long-term contracts because of continuous transfer of control to the customer. For U.S.  gov ernment  contracts,  this  continuous  transfer  of  control  to  the  customer  is  supported  by  clauses  in  the  contract  that  allow  the  customer  to unilaterally terminate the contract for conv enience, pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any work in process. Similarly, for non-U.S. gov ernment contracts, the customer typically controls the work in process as ev idenced either by contractual termination clauses or by our rights to payment of the transaction price associated with work performed to date on products or serv ices that do not hav e an alternativ e use to the Company.\n\nThe accounting for long-term contracts inv olv es a judgmental process of estimating total rev enues, costs and profit for each performance obligation. Cost of  sales  is  recognized  as  incurred.  T he  amount  reported  as  rev enues  is  determined  by  adding  a  proportionate  amount  of  the  estimated  profit  to  the amount reported as cost of sales. Recognizing rev enue as costs are incurred prov ides an objectiv e measure of progress on the long-term contract and thereby best depicts the extent of transfer of control to the customer.\n\nFor long-term contracts for which rev enue is recognized ov er time, changes in estimated rev enues, cost of sales and the related effect on operating income are recognized using a cumulativ e catch-up adjustment which recognizes in the current period the cumulativ e effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a long-term contract's percentage-of-completion. When the current estimates of total rev enues and costs at completion for a long-term contract indicate a loss, a prov ision for the entire reach-forward loss on the long-term contract is recognized.\n\nThe table below reflects the impact of net cumulativ e catch-up adjustments for changes in estimated rev enues and costs at completion across all longterm contracts including the impact to Loss from operations from estimated losses on unexercised options for the years ended December 31:\n\n",

      "answer": "BA operates under cost-reimbursed contracts with the U.S. government where they are reimbursed for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit, and the Federal Acquisition Regulations guide which costs are eligible for reimbursement. This structure limits profitability volatility because the profit is predetermined and guaranteed upon reimbursement. In contrast, GD's cost-reimbursement contracts include incentive or award-based fees that depend on achieving targets like cost, schedule, and performance metrics. This creates more variability in GD's profitability, as the final fee depends on performance outcomes. Therefore, BA faces lower profitability exposure due to guaranteed fees, while GD assumes higher exposure due to performance-linked incentives.",

We allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation to deliv er a good or serv ice, or a collection of goods and/or serv ices, based on the relativ e standalone selling prices. A long-term contract will typically represent a single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying goods and/or serv ices and the significant serv ice of integration that we prov ide. While the scope and price on certain long-term contracts may be modified ov er their life, the transaction price is based on current rights and obligations under the contract and does not include potential modifications until they are agreed upon with the customer. When applicable, a cumulativ e adjustment or separate recognition for the additional scope and price may result. Long-term contracts can be negotiated with a fixed price or a price in which we are reimbursed for costs incurred plus an agreed upon profit. T he Federal Acquisition  Regulations  prov ide  guidance  on  the  types  of  cost  that  will  be  reimbursed  in  establishing  the  price  for  contracts  with  the  U.S. government. Certain long-term contracts include in the transaction price v ariable consideration, such as incentiv e and award fees, if specified targets are achiev ed. The amount included in the transaction price represents the expected v alue, based on a weighted probability, or the most likely amount.\n\nLong-term contract rev enue is recognized ov er the contract term (ov er time) as the work progresses, either as products are produced or as serv ices are rendered. We generally recognize rev enue ov er time as we perform on long-term contracts because of continuous transfer of control to the customer. For U.S.  gov ernment  contracts,  this  continuous  transfer  of  control  to  the  customer  is  supported  by  clauses  in  the  contract  that  allow  the  customer  to unilaterally terminate the contract for conv enience, pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any work in process. Similarly, for non-U.S. gov ernment contracts, the customer typically controls the work in process as ev idenced either by contractual termination clauses or by our rights to payment of the transaction price associated with work performed to date on products or serv ices that do not hav e an alternativ e use to the Company.\n\nThe accounting for long-term contracts inv olv es a judgmental process of estimating total rev enues, costs and profit for each performance obligation. Cost of  sales  is  recognized  as  incurred.  T he  amount  reported  as  rev enues  is  determined  by  adding  a  proportionate  amount  of  the  estimated  profit  to  the amount reported as cost of sales. Recognizing rev enue as costs are incurred prov ides an objectiv e measure of progress on the long-term contract and thereby best depicts the extent of transfer of control to the customer.\n\nFor long-term contracts for which rev enue is recognized ov er time, changes in estimated rev enues, cost of sales and the related effect on operating income are recognized using a cumulativ e catch-up adjustment which recognizes in the current period the cumulativ e effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a long-term contract's percentage-of-completion. When the current estimates of total rev enues and costs at completion for a long-term contract indicate a loss, a prov ision for the entire reach-forward loss on the long-term contract is recognized.\n\nThe table below reflects the impact of net cumulativ e catch-up adjustments for changes in estimated rev enues and costs at completion across all longterm contracts including the impact to Loss from operations from estimated losses on unexercised options for the years ended December 31:\n\n",

Many of our suppliers are experiencing inflationary pressures, as well as resource constraints and disruptions due to production quality issues, global supply chain constraints, and labor instability. If one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors continue to experience financial difficulties, deliv ery delays or other performance problems, we may be unable to meet commitments to our customers and our financial position, results of operations and cash flows may continue to be adversely  impacted.  In  addition,  if  one  or  more  of  the  raw  materials  on  which  we  depend  (such  as  aluminum,  titanium  or  composites)  becomes unavailable to us or our suppliers, or is av ailable only at v ery high prices, including as a result of increased tariffs and trade restrictions, or has quality issues or defects, we may be unable to deliv er one or more of our products in a timely fashion or at budgeted costs. In some instances, we depend upon a  single  source  of  supply. Any  serv ice  disruption  from  one  of  these  suppliers,  either  due  to  circumstances  beyond  the  supplier's  control,  such  as geopolitical dev elopments, or as a result of performance problems or financial difficulties, could hav e a material adv erse effect on our ability to meet commitments to our customers or increase our operating costs.\n\nSome of our and our suppliers' workforces are represented by labor unions. Work stoppages by our employees have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. Future work stoppages by our or our suppliers' employees could also adversely impact our business.\n\nApproximately  58,000  employees,  which  constitute  34%  of  our  total  workforce,  were  union  represented  as  of  December  31,  2024  under  collectiv e bargaining  agreements  with  v arying  durations  and  expiration  dates.  As  of  December  31,  2024,  we  had  9  unions  in  the  U.S.  with  27  independent agreements and 18 employee representativ e bodies internationally, and we cannot predict how stable our union relationships will be or whether we will be able  to  meet  the  unions'  requirements.  On  September  12,  2024,  our  contract  with  IAM  751,  which  represents  ov er  30,000  Boeing  manufacturing employees primarily located in Washington state, expired and 96% of IAM 751 members v oted to initiate a strike. On Nov ember 4, 2024, members of IAM 751 voted to ratify a new contract, thereby ending the strike. As a result of the strike, production of our commercial aircraft, other than the 787 production in Charleston, and certain of our Defense, Space &amp; Security products halted, adv ersely impacting our business and financial position. Net cash used by operating activ ities  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2024,  was  $12.1  billion  and  we  expect  further  negativ e  operating  cash  flows  to continue in future quarters as we work to ramp up production and deliv eries.

      "answer": "EMR excludes NAV-valued investments from the fair value hierarchy and focuses on long-term investment horizons with routine rebalancing, emphasizing diversification across asset classes without leveraging techniques. In contrast, GD reports NAV-valued investments as Level 2 or Level 3 assets, with specific disclosures about redemption notice periods of up to 90 days and the practical expedient of using NAV for valuation. GD also provides a more granular breakdown of asset levels (Level 1, Level 2, Level 3) and explicitly discusses liquidity considerations for commingled funds and real estate investments.

The equity strategy is to minimize concentrations of risk by investing primarily in a mix of companies that are diversified across geographies, market capitalization, style, sectors and industries worldwide. The approach for bonds emphasizes investment-grade corporate and government debt with maturities matching a portion of the longer duration pension liabilities. The bonds strategy also includes a high-yield element which is generally shorter in duration. For diversification, a small portion of U.S. plan assets is allocated to private equity partnerships and real asset fund investments, providing opportunities for above market returns.

The Company does not hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. The value of derivatives and other financial instruments is subject to change as a result of market movements in rates and prices. Sensitivity analysis is one technique used to forecast the impact of these movements. Based on a hypothetical 10 percent increase in interest rates, a 10 percent decrease in commodity prices or a 10 percent weakening in the U.S. dollar across all currencies, the potential losses in future earnings, fair value or cash flows are not material. Sensitivity analysis has limitations; for example, a weaker U.S. dollar would benefit future earnings through favorable translation of non-U.S. operating results, and lower commodity prices would benefit future earnings through lower cost of sales. See Notes 1, and 9 through 11.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies\n\nPreparation of the Company's financial statements requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates regarding uncertainties that could affect reported revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities and equity. Note 1 describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The most significant areas where management judgments and estimates impact the primary financial statements are described below. Actual results in these areas could differ materially from management's estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\n## REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nThe Company evaluates its contracts with customers to identify the promised goods or services and recognizes revenue for the identified performance obligations at the amount the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. Revenue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied and control has transferred to the customer, typically when products are shipped or delivered, title and risk of loss pass to the customer, and the Company has a present right to payment. The majority of the Company's revenues relate to a broad offering of manufactured products which are recognized at the point in time when control transfers, generally in accordance with shipping terms. A portion of the Company's revenues relate to the sale of software and post-contract customer support, parts and labor for repairs, and engineering services.\n\nIn some circumstances, contracts include multiple performance obligations, where revenue is recognized separately for each good or service, as well as contracts where revenue is recognized over time as control transfers to the customer. Tangible products represent a large majority of the delivered items in contracts with multiple performance obligations or where revenue is recognized over time, while a smaller portion is attributable to installation, service and maintenance. In sales arrangements that involve multiple performance obligations, revenue is allocated based on the relative standalone selling price for each performance obligation. Observable selling prices from actual transactions are used whenever possible. In other instances, the Company determines the standalone selling price based on third-party pricing or management's best estimate. For revenues recognized over time, the Company typically uses an input method to determine progress and recognize revenue, based on costs incurred. The Company believes costs incurred closely correspond with its performance under the contract and the transfer of control to the customer.\n\n## VALUATION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION\n\nAssets and liabilities acquired in business combinations, including intangible assets, are accounted for using the acquisition method and recorded at their respective fair values. In fiscal 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Aspen Technology, Inc. and engaged an independent third-party valuation specialist to assist in the determination of the fair value of intangible assets. This included the use of certain assumptions and estimates, including the projected revenue for the customer relationship and developed technology intangible asset and the obsolescence rate for the developed technology intangible asset. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates to be reasonable and appropriate, they require judgement and are based on experience and historical information obtained from Aspen Technology, Inc.",

The majority of these revenues relate to projects in the Systems &amp; Software product offering within the Automation Solutions segment where revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method to reflect the transfer of control over time, while a smaller amount is attributable to long-term maintenance and service contracts where revenue is typically recognized on a straight-line basis as the services are provided. Approximately 5 percent of revenues relate to sales arrangements with multiple performance obligations, principally in the Automation Solutions and AspenTech segments. Tangible products represent a large majority of the delivered items in contracts with multiple performance obligations or where revenue is recognized over time, while a smaller portion is attributable to installation, service and maintenance.\n\nFor projects where revenue is recognized over time, the Company typically uses an input method to determine progress and recognize revenue, based on costs incurred.

Generally, contract duration is short-term, and cancellation, termination or refund provisions apply only in the event of contract breach and are rarely invoked.\n\nPayment terms vary but are generally short-term in nature. The Company's long-term contracts, where revenue is generally recognized over time, are typically billed as work progresses in accordance with the contract terms and conditions, either at periodic intervals or upon achievement of certain milestones. The timing of revenue recognition and billings under these contracts results in either unbilled receivables (contract assets) when revenue recognized exceeds billings, or customer advances (contract liabilities) when billings exceed revenue recognized. Unbilled receivables are reclassified to accounts receivable when an unconditional right to consideration exists, typically when a milestone in the contract is achieved. The Company does not evaluate whether the transaction price includes a significant financing component for contracts where the time between cash collection and performance is less than one year.\n\nCertain arrangements with customers include variable consideration, typically in the form of rebates, cash discounts or penalties. In limited circumstances, the Company sells products with a general right of return. In most instances, returns are limited to product quality issues. The Company records a reduction to revenue at the time of sale to reflect the ultimate amount of consideration it expects to receive. The Company's estimates are updated quarterly based on historical experience, trend analysis, and expected market conditions. Variable consideration is typically not constrained at the time revenue is recognized. See Notes 2 and 18 for additional information about the Company's revenues.\n\n## Derivatives and Hedging\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices due to its worldwide presence and diverse business profile. The Company's foreign currency exposures relate to transactions denominated in currencies that differ from the functional currencies of its business units, primarily in euros, Mexican pesos, and Singapore dollars. Primary commodity exposures are price fluctuations on forecasted purchases of copper and aluminum and related products. As part of the Company's risk management strategy, derivative instruments are selectively used in an effort to minimize the impact of these exposures. Foreign exchange forwards and options are utilized to hedge foreign currency exposures impacting sales or cost of sales transactions, firm commitments and the fair value of assets and liabilities, while swap and option contracts may be used to minimize the effect of commodity price fluctuations on the cost of sales. Non-U.S. dollar obligations are utilized to reduce foreign currency risk associated with the Company's net investments in foreign operations. All derivatives are associated with specific underlying exposures and the Company does not hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. The duration of hedge positions is generally two years or less, except for the Company's net investment hedges.\n\nAll derivatives are accounted for under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , and recognized at fair value. For derivatives hedging variability in future cash flows, any gain or loss is deferred in stockholders' equity and recognized when the underlying hedged transaction impacts earnings.

Contract  costs  include  labor,  material,  overhead  and,  when  appropriate, G&amp;A expenses.\n\nMost  of  our  revenue  recognized  at  a  point  in  time  is  for  the  manufacture  of  business  jet  aircraft  in  our Aerospace segment. Revenue on these contracts is recognized when the customer obtains control of the asset, which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the fully outfitted aircraft.\n\nThe majority of our revenue is derived from long-term contracts and programs that can span several years. Accounting  for  long-term  contracts  and  programs  involves  the  use  of  various  techniques  to  estimate  total contract  revenue  and  costs.  For  long-term  contracts,  we  estimate  the  profit  on  a  contract  as  the  difference between the total estimated revenue and expected costs to complete a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract.\n\nContract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that often span several years. These assumptions include labor productivity and availability; the complexity of the work to be performed; the cost and availability of materials; the performance of subcontractors; and the availability and timing of funding from the customer.\n\nThe nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including claims, award fees and incentive fees. We include in our contract estimates additional revenue for submitted contract modifications or claims against the customer when we believe we have an enforceable right to the modification or claim, the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable. In evaluating these criteria, we consider the contractual/legal basis for the claim, the cause of any additional costs incurred, the reasonableness of those costs and  the  objective  evidence  available  to  support  the  claim.  We  include  award  fees  or  incentive  fees  in  the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee. These estimates are based on historical award experience, anticipated performance and our best judgment at the time.\n\nAs a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts, we review  and  update  our  contract-related  estimates  regularly.  We  recognize  adjustments  in  estimated  profit  on contracts under the cumulative catch-up method. Under this method, the impact of",

          "chunk_text": "contracts include multiple performance obligations, where revenue is recognized separately for each good or service, as well as contracts where revenue is recognized over time as control transfers to the customer.\n\nRevenue is recognized over time for approximately 10 percent of the Company's revenues. The majority of these revenues relate to projects in the Systems &amp; Software product offering within the Automation Solutions segment where revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method to reflect the transfer of control over time, while a smaller amount is attributable to long-term maintenance and service contracts where revenue is typically recognized on a straight-line basis as the services are provided. Approximately 5 percent of revenues relate to sales arrangements with multiple performance obligations, principally in the Automation Solutions and AspenTech segments. Tangible products represent a large majority of the delivered items in contracts with multiple performance obligations or where revenue is recognized over time, while a smaller portion is attributable to installation, service and maintenance.\n\nFor projects where revenue is recognized over time, the Company typically uses an input method to determine progress and recognize revenue, based on costs incurred. The Company believes costs incurred closely correspond with its performance under the contract and the transfer of control to the customer.\n\nIn sales arrangements that involve multiple performance obligations, revenue is allocated based on the relative standalone selling price for each performance obligation. Observable selling prices from actual transactions are used whenever possible. In other instances, the Company determines the standalone selling price based on third-party pricing or management's best estimate. Generally, contract duration is short-term, and cancellation, termination or refund provisions apply only in the event of contract breach and are rarely invoked.\n\nPayment terms vary but are generally short-term in nature. The Company's long-term contracts, where revenue is generally recognized over time, are typically billed as work progresses in accordance with the contract terms and conditions, either at periodic intervals or upon achievement of certain milestones. The timing of revenue recognition and billings under these contracts results in either unbilled receivables (contract assets) when revenue recognized exceeds billings, or customer advances (contract liabilities) when billings exceed revenue recognized. Unbilled receivables are reclassified to accounts receivable when an unconditional right to consideration exists, typically when a milestone in the contract is achieved. The Company does not evaluate whether the transaction price includes a significant financing component for contracts where the time between cash collection and performance is less than one year.\n\nCertain arrangements with customers include variable consideration, typically in the form of rebates, cash discounts or penalties. In limited circumstances, the Company sells products with a general right of return. In most instances, returns are limited to product quality issues. The Company records a reduction to revenue at the time of sale to reflect the ultimate amount of consideration it expects to receive. The Company's estimates are updated quarterly based on historical experience, trend analysis, and expected market conditions. Variable consideration is typically not constrained at the time revenue is recognized. See Notes 2 and 18 for additional information about the Company's revenues.\n\n## Derivatives and Hedging\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices due to its worldwide presence and diverse business profile. The Company's foreign currency exposures relate to transactions denominated in currencies that differ from the functional currencies of its business units, primarily in euros, Mexican pesos, and Singapore dollars. Primary commodity exposures are price fluctuations on forecasted purchases of copper and aluminum and related products. As part of the Company's risk management strategy, derivative instruments are selectively used in an effort to minimize the impact of these exposures. Foreign exchange forwards and options are utilized to hedge foreign currency exposures impacting sales or cost of sales transactions, firm commitments and the fair value of assets and liabilities, while swap and option contracts may be used to minimize the effect of commodity price fluctuations on the cost of sales. Non-U.S. dollar obligations are utilized to reduce foreign currency risk associated with the Company's net investments in foreign operations. All derivatives are associated with specific underlying exposures and the Company does not hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. The duration of hedge positions is generally two years or less, except for the Company's net investment hedges.\n\nAll derivatives are accounted for under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , and recognized at fair value. For derivatives hedging variability in future cash flows, any gain or loss is deferred in stockholders' equity and recognized when the underlying hedged transaction impacts earnings. The majority of the Company's derivatives",

          "chunk_text": "Goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. We review goodwill for impairment annually at each of our reporting units or when circumstances indicate that the likelihood of an impairment is greater than 50%. Our reporting units are consistent with our operating segments in Note O. We use both qualitative and quantitative approaches when testing goodwill for impairment. When determining the approach to be used, we consider the current facts and circumstances of each reporting unit as well as the excess of each reporting unit's estimated fair value over its carrying  value  based  on  our  most  recent  quantitative  assessments.  Our  qualitative  approach  evaluates  the business environment  and  various  events impacting  the reporting unit including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, changes in the business environment and reporting unit-specific events. If, based on the qualitative assessment, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater  than  its  carrying  value,  then  a  quantitative  assessment  is  not  necessary.  However,  if  a  quantitative assessment is determined to be necessary, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value and, if  necessary, recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. Our estimate of fair value is based primarily on the discounted cash flows of the underlying operations.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we completed qualitative assessments for our reporting units as the estimated fair values of each of the reporting units significantly exceeded the respective carrying values based on our most recent quantitative assessments, which were performed as of December 31, 2018, for the Aerospace, Marine Systems and Combat Systems reporting units, and as of December 31, 2020, for the Technologies reporting unit.  Our  qualitative  assessments,  including  consideration  of  the  impact  of  the  coronavirus  (COVID-19) pandemic, did not present indicators of impairment for the reporting units. For a summary of our goodwill by reporting unit, see Note H.\n\nAccounting Standards Updates. There  are  accounting  standards  that  have  been  issued  by  the  Financial Accounting  Standards  Board  (FASB)  but  are  not  yet  effective.  These  standards  are  not  expected  to  have  a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\n## B. REVENUE\n\nPerformance Obligations. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of account for revenue. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct  performance obligation within that contract and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation  is  satisfied.  The  majority  of  our  contracts  have  a  single  performance  obligation  as  the  promise  to transfer the individual goods or services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and is, therefore, not distinct. Some of our contracts have multiple performance obligations, most commonly due to the  contract  covering  multiple  phases  of  the  product  life  cycle  (development,  production,  maintenance  and support).  For  contracts  with  multiple  performance  obligations,  we  allocate  the  contract's  transaction  price  to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct  good  or service in the contract. The primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin approach, under which we forecast our expected costs of satisfying a performance obligation and then add an appropriate margin for that distinct good or service.\n\nContract  modifications  are  routine  in  the  performance  of  our  contracts.  Contracts  are  often  modified  to account for changes in contract specifications or requirements. In most instances, contract modifications are for goods or services that are not distinct and, therefore, are accounted for as part of the existing contract.",

We sometimes rely on only one or two sources of supply that, if disrupted, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our customer commitments. Our ability  to  perform  our  obligations  may  be  materially  adversely  affected  if  one  or  more  of  these  suppliers  is unable to provide the agreed-upon materials, perform the agreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner, or engages in misconduct or other improper activities.\n\nOur  future  success  depends  in  part  on  our  ability  to  develop  new  products  and  technologies  and maintain a qualified workforce to meet the needs of our customers. Many of the products and services we provide involve sophisticated technologies and engineering, with related complex manufacturing and systemintegration  processes.  Our  customers'  requirements  change  and  evolve  regularly.  Accordingly,  our  future performance depends in part on our ability to continue to develop, manufacture and provide innovative products and  services  and  bring  those  offerings  to  market  quickly  at  cost-effective  prices.  Some  new  products, particularly in our Aerospace segment, must meet extensive and time-consuming regulatory requirements that are often outside our control and may result in unanticipated delays. Additionally, due to the highly specialized nature of our business, we must hire and retain the skilled and qualified personnel necessary to perform the services  required  by  our  customers.  To  the  extent  that  the  demand  for  skilled  personnel  exceeds  supply,  we could experience higher labor, recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain such employees.

In  some  countries  there  is  increased  chance  for  economic,  legal  or political  changes,  and  procurement  procedures  may  be  less  robust  or  mature,  which  may  complicate  the contracting  process.  Our  non-U.S.  operations  may  be  sensitive  to  and  impacted  by  changes  in  a  foreign government's  national  policies  and  priorities,  political  leadership  and  budgets,  which  may  be  influenced  by changes in threat environments, geopolitical uncertainties, volatility in economic conditions and other economic and  political  factors.  Changes  and  developments  in  any  of  these  matters  or  factors  may  occur  suddenly  and could impact funding for programs or delay purchasing decisions or customer payments. Non-U.S. transactions can involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchange rate variability and differing legal systems.  Our  non-U.S.  operations  are  subject  to  U.S.  and  foreign  laws  and  regulations,  including  laws  and regulations relating to import-export controls, technology transfers, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other anti-corruption laws, and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). An unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors or a failure to comply with U.S. or foreign laws could result in administrative,  civil  or  criminal  liabilities,  including  suspension  or  debarment  from  government  contracts  or suspension of our export privileges, and could materially adversely affect revenue and earnings associated with our non-U.S. operations.\n\nIn  addition,  some  non-U.S.  government  customers  require  contractors  to  enter  into  letters  of  credit, performance  or  surety  bonds,  bank  guarantees  and  other  similar  financial  arrangements.  We  may  also  be required to agree to specific in-country purchases, manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements, known  as  offsets,  that  require  us  to  satisfy  investment  or  other  requirements  or  face  penalties.

If environmental or climate-change laws or regulations are adopted or  changed  that  impose  significant  new  costs,  operational  restrictions  or  compliance  requirements  upon  our business or our products, they could increase our capital expenditures, reduce our margins and adversely affect our financial position.\n\n## FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nThis  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  contains  forward-looking  statements  that  are  based  on  management's expectations, estimates, projections and  assumptions.  Words  such  as  'expects,'  'anticipates,' 'plans,' 'believes,' 'scheduled,' 'outlook,' 'estimates,' 'should' and variations of these words and similar expressions are  intended  to  identify  forward-looking  statements.  Examples  include  projections  of  revenue,  earnings, operating  margin,  segment  performance,  cash  flows,  contract  awards,  aircraft  production,  deliveries  and backlog.  In  making  these  statements,  we  rely  on  assumptions  and  analyses  based  on  our  experience  and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors we consider appropriate under the circumstances. We believe our estimates and judgments are reasonable based on information  available  to  us  at  the  time.  Forward-looking  statements  are  made  pursuant  to  the  safe  harbor provisions  of  the  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform  Act  of  1995,  as  amended.  These  statements  are  not guarantees  of  future  performance  and  involve  risks  and  uncertainties  that  are  difficult  to  predict.  Therefore, actual future results and trends",

          "chunk_text": "## Human Capital\n\nOur success is dependent upon our people, working together with a common purpose. We have approximately 534,000 employees (excluding temporary seasonal employees), of which 444,000 are in the U.S. and 90,000 are located internationally. Our global workforce includes approximately 89,000 management employees (44% of whom are part-time) and 445,000 hourly employees (51% of whom are part-time). More than 70% of our U.S. employees are represented by unions, primarily those employees handling or transporting packages. In addition, approximately 3,100 of our pilots are represented by the Independent Pilots Association.\n\nWe believe that UPS employees are among the most motivated, highest-performing people in the industry and provide us with a meaningful competitive advantage. To assist with employee recruitment and retention, we continue to review the competitiveness of our employee value proposition, including benefits and pay, the range of continuous training, talent development and promotional opportunities. For additional information on the importance of our human capital efforts, see \"Risk Factors - Business and Operating Risks - Failure to attract or retain qualified employees could materially adversely affect us\".\n\n## Oversight and management\n\nWe believe in creating an inclusive and equitable environment that represents a broad spectrum of backgrounds, cultures and stakeholders. By leveraging diversity with respect to gender, age, ethnicity, skills and other factors, and creating inclusive environments, we believe we can improve organizational effectiveness, cultivate innovation and drive growth.\n\nOur Board of Directors and Board committees provide oversight on human capital matters through a variety of methods and processes. These include regular updates and discussion around human capital transformation efforts, technology initiatives impacting the workforce, health and safety matters, employee survey results related to culture and other matters, hiring and retention, employee demographics, labor relations and contract negotiations, compensation and benefits, succession planning and employee training initiatives. We believe the Board's oversight of these matters helps identify and mitigate exposure to labor and human capital management risks, and is part of the broader framework that guides how we attract, retain and develop a workforce that aligns with our values and strategies.\n\n## Transformation\n\nAs we expand and enter new markets, and seek to capture new opportunities and pursue growth, we need employees to grow and innovate along with us. We believe that transforming the UPS employee experience is foundational to our success. This requires a thoughtful balance between the culture we have cultivated over the years and new approaches to lead our business into the future.\n\nWe are investing in capabilities that will transform our business, including investments in employee opportunities to support growth. We provide training for management employees on professionalism and performance as well as unconscious bias and diversity and inclusion to ensure our actions match our values.\n\nAdditional information on our human capital efforts is contained in our annual sustainability report, which describes our activities that support our commitment to acting responsibly and contributing to society. This report is available under the heading \"Social Impact\" at www.about.ups.com .\n\n## Collective bargaining\n\nWe bargain in good faith with the unions that represent our employees. We frequently engage union leaders at the national level and at local chapters throughout the United States. We participate in works councils and associations outside the U.S., which allows us to respond to emerging regional issues. This work helps our operations to build and maintain productive relationships with our employees. For additional information regarding employees employed under collective bargaining agreements, see note 7 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.",

As these liabilities are settled using plan assets, our future cash requirements associated with these liabilities are generally limited to  the  annual  cash  contributions  to  these  plans  required  in  accordance  with  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS) regulations.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## International Pension Benefits\n\nWe also sponsor various defined benefit plans covering certain of our international employees. The majority of our international obligations are for defined benefit plans in Canada and the United Kingdom. In addition, many of our international employees are covered by government-sponsored retirement and pension plans. We are not directly responsible for providing benefits to participants of government-sponsored plans.\n\n## U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits\n\nWe also sponsor postretirement medical plans in the U.S. that provide healthcare benefits to our non-union retirees, as well as select union retirees who meet certain eligibility requirements and who are not otherwise covered by multiemployer plans. Generally, this includes employees with at least 10 years of service who have reached age 55 and employees who are eligible for postretirement medical benefits from a Company-sponsored plan pursuant to collective bargaining agreements. We have the right to modify or terminate certain of these plans. These benefits have been provided to certain retirees on a noncontributory basis; however, in many cases, retirees are required to contribute all or a portion of the total cost of the coverage.\n\n## Defined Contribution Plans\n\nWe sponsor a defined contribution plan for employees not covered under collective bargaining agreements, and several smaller defined contribution plans for certain employees covered under collective bargaining agreements. We match, in shares of UPS common stock or cash, a portion of the participating employees' contributions. Matching contributions charged to expense were $153, $139 and $130 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nIn addition to current benefits under the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan, non-union employees hired after July 1, 2016, receive a retirement contribution. UPS contributes 3% to 8% of eligible pay to the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan based on years of vesting service and business unit. Contributions under this plan are subject to maximum compensation and contribution limits for a taxqualified defined contribution plan as prescribed by the IRS. The UPS Restoration Savings Plan is a non-qualified plan that provides benefits to certain participants in the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan for amounts that exceed the benefit limits described above.

      "question": "How do the differences in the methods used by GD and UPS to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations affect the timing and reliability of their revenue recognition for long-term contracts?",
      "answer": "GD primarily uses the cost-to-cost method to measure progress toward completing long-term contracts, recognizing revenue as costs are incurred relative to total estimated costs. This method aligns with the continuous transfer of control to the customer and allows for revenue to be recognized over time. In contrast, UPS uses the cost-to-cost method for package delivery contracts but applies a time-in-transit output method for freight forwarding contracts. This difference means that UPS may recognize revenue at different intervals depending on the nature of the service, which can affect the timing and predictability of revenue recognition. Since GD's contracts are largely defense-related and span multiple years, their revenue recognition depends heavily on accurate cost estimation and contract profitability assessments, while UPS's method for freight forwarding aligns more with the duration and delivery milestones of shipments, impacting the reliability of revenue recognition based on actual progress rather than incurred costs.",

We  employ  judgment  in  making  our  estimates,  but  they  are  based  on historical  experience,  currently  available  information  and  various  other  assumptions  that  we  believe  to  be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe our judgment is applied  consistently  and  produces  financial  information  that  fairly  depicts  our  results  of  operations  for  all periods presented.\n\nIn  our  opinion,  the  following  policies  are  critical  and  require  the  use  of  significant  judgment  in  their application:\n\nRevenue. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer,  and  is  the  unit  of  account  for  revenue. A  contract's  transaction  price  is  allocated  to  each  distinct performance obligation within that contract and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. Our performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in time.\n\nSubstantially  all  of  our  revenue  in  the  defense  segments  is  recognized  over  time,  because  control  is transferred continuously to our customers. Typically, revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date  relative  to  total  estimated  costs  at  completion  to  measure  progress  toward  satisfying  our  performance obligations.  Incurred  cost  represents  work  performed,  which  corresponds  with,  and  thereby  best  depicts,  the transfer  of  control  to  the  customer.  Contract  costs  include  labor,  material,  overhead  and,  when  appropriate, G&amp;A expenses.\n\nMost  of  our  revenue  recognized  at  a  point  in  time  is  for  the  manufacture  of  business  jet  aircraft  in  our Aerospace segment. Revenue on these contracts is recognized when the customer obtains control of the asset, which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the fully outfitted aircraft.\n\nThe majority of our revenue is derived from long-term contracts and programs that can span several years. Accounting  for  long-term  contracts  and  programs  involves  the  use  of  various  techniques  to  estimate  total contract  revenue  and  costs.  For  long-term  contracts,  we  estimate  the  profit  on  a  contract  as  the  difference between the total estimated revenue and expected costs to complete a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract.\n\nContract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that often span several years. These assumptions include labor productivity and availability; the complexity of the work to be performed; the cost and availability of materials; the performance of subcontractors; and the availability and timing of funding from the customer.\n\nThe nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including claims, award fees and incentive fees. We include in our contract estimates additional revenue for submitted contract modifications or claims against the customer when we believe we have an enforceable right to the modification or claim, the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable. In evaluating these criteria, we consider the contractual/legal basis for the claim, the cause of any additional costs incurred, the reasonableness of those costs and  the  objective  evidence  available  to  support  the  claim.  We  include  award  fees  or  incentive  fees  in  the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee. These estimates are based on historical award experience, anticipated performance and our best judgment at the time.\n\nAs a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts, we review  and  update  our  contract-related  estimates  regularly.  We  recognize  adjustments  in  estimated  profit  on contracts under the cumulative catch-up method. Under this method, the impact of",

          "chunk_text": "## UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nIn certain business units, such as Logistics, we sell customized, customer-specific solutions in which we integrate a complex set of tasks and components into a single capability (even if that single capability results in the delivery of multiple units). Hence, the entire contract is accounted for as one performance obligation. In these cases we typically use the expected cost plus a margin approach to estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation.\n\n## Satisfaction of Performance Obligations\n\nWe generally recognize revenue over time as we perform the services in the contract because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer. Our customers receive the benefit of our services as the goods are transported from one location to another. Further, if we were unable to complete delivery to the final location, another entity would not need to reperform the transportation service already performed.\n\nAs control transfers over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. We use the cost-to-cost measure of progress for our package delivery contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Revenues, including ancillary or accessorial fees and reductions for estimated customer incentives, are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. Costs to fulfill include labor and other direct costs and an allocation of indirect costs. For our freight forwarding contracts, an output method of progress based on time-in-transit is utilized as the timing of costs incurred does not best depict the transfer of control to the customer. In our Logistics business we have a right to consideration from customers in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customers of our performance completed to date; therefore we recognize revenue in the amount to which we have a right to invoice the customer.\n\n## Variable Consideration\n\nIt is common for our contracts to contain customer incentives, guaranteed service refunds or other provisions that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. These variable amounts are generally dependent upon achievement of certain incentive tiers or performance metrics. We estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled. We include estimated amounts of revenue, which may be reduced by incentives or other contract provisions, in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based on an assessment of anticipated customer spending and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us.\n\n## Contract Modifications\n\nContracts are often modified to account for changes in the rates we charge our customers or to add additional, distinct services. We consider contract modifications to exist when the modification either creates new, or changes the existing, enforceable rights and obligations. Contract modifications that add distinct goods or services are treated as separate contracts. Contract modifications that do not add distinct goods or services typically change the price of existing services. These contract modifications are accounted for prospectively as the remaining performance obligations are distinct.\n\n## Payment Terms\n\nUnder the typical payment terms of our customer contracts, the customer pays at periodic intervals, which are generally seven days within our U.S. Domestic Package business, for shipments included on invoices received. Invoices are generated each week on the week-ending day, which is Saturday for the majority of our U.S. Domestic Package business, but could be another day depending on the business unit or the specific agreement with the customer. It is not customary business practice to extend payment terms past 90 days, and as such, we do not have a practice of including a significant financing component within our contracts with customers.",

If we can no longer adjust successfully to these changing acquisition policies, our revenues and market share could be impacted. Also, additional federal appropriations to cover the increased costs of federal contractors' compliance with evolving U.S. Government contractual requirements associated with COVID-19 mitigation are unlikely, reducing the U.S. Government's buying power.\n\n## Our ability to deliver products and services that satisfy customer requirements is heavily dependent on the performance and financial stability of our subcontractors and suppliers, as well as on the availability of raw materials and other components.\n\nWe rely on other companies, including U.S. and non-U.S. subcontractors and suppliers, to provide and produce raw materials,  integrated  components  and  sub-assemblies,  and  production  commodities  and  to  perform  some  of  the services  that  we  provide  to  our  customers.  If  one  or  more  of  our  suppliers  or  subcontractors  experiences  financial difficulties, delivery delays or other performance problems, we may be unable to meet commitments to our customers or  incur  additional  costs.  In  addition,  if  one  or  more  of  the  raw  materials  on  which  we  depend  (such  as  aluminum, titanium or composites) becomes unavailable to us or our suppliers, or is available only at very high prices, we may be unable to deliver one or more of our products in a timely fashion or at budgeted costs. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply. Any service disruption from one of these suppliers, either due to circumstances beyond the supplier's control, such as geopolitical developments, or as a result of performance problems or financial difficulties, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments to our customers or increase our operating costs.\n\n## Competition within our markets and with respect to the products we sell may reduce our future contracts and sales.\n\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive and one or more of our competitors may have more extensive or  more  specialized  engineering,  manufacturing  and  marketing  capabilities  than  we  do  in  some  areas.  In  our Commercial  Airplanes  business,  we  anticipate  increasing  competition  among  non-U.S.  aircraft  manufacturers  of commercial jet aircraft. In our BDS business, we anticipate that the effects of defense industry consolidation, shifting acquisition and budget priorities, and continued cost pressure at our U.S. DoD and non-U.S. customers will intensify competition for many of our BDS products. Our BGS segment faces competition from many of the same strong U.S. and non-U.S. competitors facing BCA and BDS.

Generally, a bid protest will delay the start of contract activities, delay earnings, and could result in the award decision being overturned and require a re-bid of the contract. Highly competitive activity within the commercial aerospace industry has included  substantial  discounts  and  other  financial  incentives,  performance  and  operating  cost  guarantees,  and  participation  in financing arrangements, in order to secure both new engine business and the aftermarket revenues associated with these products. Furthermore, our competitors, including our customers, may develop competing technologies which gain industry acceptance in advance  of  or  instead  of  our  products,  or  meet  particular  in-demand  technological  needs  before  us  or  with  technology  that  is superior to our existing or new technologies. For example, the enhanced focus on climate change has increased demand for more environmentally  sustainable  products  and  services,  as  described  below.  Our  competitors  may  develop  sustainable  products  or services that are available to our customers before our products or services, or that are adopted more readily than our products or services.  In  addition,  our  competitors  or  customers  might  develop  new  technologies  or  offerings  that  might  cause  our  existing technologies and offerings to become obsolete or otherwise decrease demand for our offerings. In addition, the possibility exists that competitors or customers will develop aftermarket services and aftermarket parts for our products that attract customers and adversely impact our return on investment on new products. We also anticipate companies continuing to enhance their competitive position against our defense businesses as a result of continued domestic and cross-border defense industry consolidation and the expansion  of  competitors'  capabilities  throughout  the  supply  chain  through  vertical  integration.  We  are  also  facing  heightened competition  domestically  and  internationally  from  foreign  and  multinational  firms. Additionally,  some  customers,  including  the DoD, are increasingly turning to commercial contractors, rather than traditional defense contractors, for information technology and other  support  work.  If  we  are  unable  to  continue  to  compete  successfully  against  our  current  or  future  competitors  in  our  core businesses,  we  may  experience  declines  in  revenues  and  industry  segment  share. Any  of  the  foregoing  could  have  a  material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\n\n## OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\nWe Use a Variety of Raw Materials, Supplier-Provided Parts, Components, Sub-Systems and Contract Manufacturing Services, and  Significant  Shortages,  Capacity  Constraints,  Production  Disruptions  or  Price  Increases  Could  Increase  Our  Operating Costs and Adversely Impact the Competitive Positions of Our Products. Our reliance on U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers (including third-party manufacturing suppliers, subcontractors and service providers) and commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts, components and sub-systems used in our products exposes us to volatility  in  the  prices  and  availability  of  these  materials  and services. In many instances, we depend upon a single source of supply, manufacturing, services support or assembly, or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. Our defense businesses are subject to specific  procurement  requirements  that  limit  the  types  of  materials  they  use,  which  may  further  limit  the  suppliers  and subcontractors  they  may  utilize.  They  also  must  require  suppliers  to  comply  with  various  DoD  cybersecurity  requirements. A disruption in deliveries from our suppliers, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions, supplier quality issues (such as issues with defects or fraudulent parts), closing, bankruptcy or financial difficulties of our suppliers, price increases due to inflation  or  otherwise,  or  decreased  availability  of  raw  materials  or  commodities,  including  as  a  result  of  war,  natural  disaster, health pandemic or other business continuity events, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers  or  increase  our  operating  costs.  We  believe  that  our  supply  management  and  production  practices  are  based  on  an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. Nonetheless, price increases, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and continues to impact, our supply chain, as described above.\n\nDue to the Nature of Our Products and Services, a Product Safety Failure or Other Failure Affecting Our or Our Customers' or Suppliers'  Products  or  Systems  Could  Seriously  Harm  Our  Business. Our products  and  services  are  highly  sophisticated  and specialized, involve complex advanced technologies, are often integrated with third-party products and services and are utilized for specific purposes that require precision, reliability and durability. Many of our products and services include both hardware and software  that  involve  industrial  machinery  and  intricate  aviation  and  defense  systems,  including  commercial  and  military  jet engines, power and control systems and other aircraft parts, air and missile defense systems, and military sensors and command and control systems.

These statements include the accounts of all  majority-owned  subsidiaries  and  variable  interest  entities  that  are  required  to  be  consolidated.  All  significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. As described in Note 22, we operate in four reportable segments: Commercial Airplanes (BCA), Defense, Space &amp; Security (BDS), Global Services (BGS) and Boeing Capital (BCC).\n\n## Liquidity Matters\n\nThe global outbreak of COVID-19, 787 production issues and associated rework, and the residual impacts of the 737 MAX  grounding  continue  to  have  significant  adverse  impacts  on  our  business  and  are  expected  to  continue  to negatively impact revenue, earnings and operating cash flow in future quarters. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented shock to demand for air travel, creating a tremendous challenge for our customers, our business and the entire commercial aerospace manufacturing and services sector. We continue to expect commercial air travel to return to 2019 levels in 2023 to 2024. We expect it will take a few years beyond that for the industry to return to longterm trend growth. There is significant uncertainty with respect to when commercial air traffic levels will recover, and whether, and at what point capacity will return to and/or exceed pre-COVID-19 levels.\n\nDuring 2021, net cash used by operating activities was $3.4 billion. Our operating cash flows continue to be impacted by lower commercial airplane deliveries and concessions paid to 737 MAX customers. We expect negative operating cash flows until commercial deliveries ramp up. In 2021, we issued $9.8 billion of fixed rate senior notes that mature between 2023 and 2026. We used the net proceeds of these note issuances to repay the $13.8 billion outstanding under our two-year delayed draw term loan credit agreement. In 2021, we also repaid $1.5 billion of term notes. As a result,  our  cash  and  short-term  investment  balance  was  $16.2  billion  and  our  debt  balance  was  $58.1  billion  at December 31, 2021. In addition, we have term notes of $1.2 billion maturing in 2022.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, our unused borrowing capacity on revolving credit agreements is $14.7 billion. We anticipate that  these  revolving  credit  lines  will  remain  undrawn  and  primarily  serve  as  backup  liquidity  to  support  our  general corporate borrowing needs. Our borrowing capacity includes a $3.1 billion 364-day revolving credit facility, which is set to expire in October 2022. See Note 15.\n\nIn  2021,  our  short-term  and  long-term  credit  ratings  by  the  major  credit  rating  agencies  remained  unchanged  from 2020. There is risk for further downgrades.\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, trade payables included $2.3 billion and $3.8 billion payable to suppliers who have elected to participate in supply chain financing programs. While access to supply chain financing has been reduced due to our current credit ratings and debt levels, we do not believe that these or future changes in the availability of supply chain financing will have a significant impact on our liquidity.\n\nIn addition to our debt issuances, we have taken a number of actions to improve liquidity. During 2020, our Board of Directors  terminated  its  prior  authorization  to  repurchase  shares  of  the  Company's  outstanding  common  stock  and suspended the declaration and/or payment of dividends until further",

As  a  result  of  COVID-19,  governments,  businesses  and  individuals  have  taken  actions  such  as  instituting  lockdowns, quarantines, border closings and other travel restrictions and requirements, adopting remote working and reducing business and leisure travel, which collectively led to an unprecedented decline in demand for commercial air travel. The unprecedented decrease in air travel adversely affected our airline and airframer customers and their demand for our products and services of our Collins Aerospace and Pratt &amp; Whitney businesses. Refer to 'Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles' for further  details.  While  we  have  seen  indications  that  commercial  air  travel  is  recovering,  we  continue  to  closely  monitor  our commercial aerospace assets for recoverability and our off-balance sheet exposures. The following summarizes certain significant assets and off-balance sheet exposures specifically related to our commercial aerospace customers:\n\n",

Where it is reasonably possible that we will incur losses in excess of recorded amounts in connection with any of the matters set forth below, we will disclose either the amount or range of reasonably possible losses in excess of such amounts or, where no such amount or range can be reasonably estimated, the reasons why no such estimate can be made.\n\nMultiple legal actions have been filed against us as a result of the October 29, 2018 accident of Lion Air Flight 610 and the  March  10,  2019  accident  of  Ethiopian Airlines  Flight  302.  During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  we  entered  into  a proposed settlement with plaintiffs in a shareholder derivative lawsuit. Under the proposed settlement, which is subject to court approval, the Company would receive monetary payments of approximately $237, before attorneys' fees, and commit to making certain governance changes. Further, we are subject to, and cooperating with, ongoing governmental and regulatory  investigations  and  inquiries  relating  to  the  accidents  and  the  737  MAX. Among  these  is  an  ongoing investigation  by  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  the  outcome  of  which  may  be  material.  Other  than  with respect to the agreement described below with the U.S. Department of Justice entered in 2021, we cannot reasonably estimate  a  range  of  loss,  if  any,  not  covered  by  available  insurance  that  may  result  given  the  current  status  of  the pending lawsuits, investigations and inquiries related to the 737 MAX.\n\nOn  January  6,  2021,  we  entered  into  a  Deferred  Prosecution Agreement  with  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  that resolves the Department of Justice's previously disclosed investigation into us regarding the evaluation of the 737 MAX airplane by the Federal Aviation Administration. Under the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, we agreed to the filing of a criminal information charging the Company with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, based on the conduct of two former 737 MAX program technical pilots; the criminal information will be dismissed after three years, provided that we comply with our obligations under the agreement. The Deferred Prosecution Agreement requires that we make payments totaling $2,510, which consist of (a) a $244 criminal monetary penalty; (b) $500 in additional compensation to the heirs and/or beneficiaries of those who died in the Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 accidents; and (c) $1,770 to the Company's airline customers for harm incurred as a result of the grounding of the 737 MAX, offset in part by payments already made and the remainder satisfied through payments to be made prior to the termination of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. The agreement also requires that we review our compliance program and undertake continuous improvement efforts with respect to it, and implement enhanced compliance reporting and internal controls mechanisms. We expensed $744 in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to this agreement. During the first quarter, consistent with the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the monetary penalty was paid, and the $500 compensation amount was transferred to a fund established to benefit the heirs and/or beneficiaries of the victims of the 737 MAX accidents. In addition, the $1,770 amount related to the Company's airline customers was included in amounts reserved in prior quarters for 737 MAX customer considerations.\n\nDuring 2019, we entered into agreements with Embraer S.A. (Embraer) to establish joint ventures that included the commercial  aircraft  and  services  operations  of  Embraer,  of  which  we  were  expected  to  acquire  an  80  percent ownership stake for $4,200, as well as a joint venture to promote and develop new markets for the C-390 Millennium. In 2020, we exercised our contractual right to terminate these agreements based on Embraer's failure to meet certain required closing conditions. Embraer has disputed our right to terminate the agreements, and the dispute is currently in arbitration. We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, that may result from the arbitration.\n\n## Note 22 - Segment and Revenue Information\n\nOur primary profitability measurements to review a segment's operating results are Earnings/(loss) from operations and operating margins. We operate in four reportable segments: BCA, BDS, BGS and BCC.\n\n118",

Collins Aerospace continued its significant product development activities, including for major systems on the A321XLR, the Boeing 777X, the Irkut MC-21, the Dassault 6X Falcon, and the Xian MA700,  as  well  as  systems  in  support  of  the  Boeing  T-7A  trainer  and  the  Boeing  VC-25B.  Collins  Aerospace  also  received numerous  contract  awards  for  buyer-furnished  equipment  installation  for  interiors,  avionics,  and  wheels  and  brakes,  and strategically important contract awards for its FlightSense\u00ae full life-cycle support services. In November 2021, Collins Aerospace completed its previously announced acquisition of FlightAware, a digital aviation company that operates flight tracking and data platforms. In 2021, Collins Aerospace's F-16 Performance Base Logistics (PBL) program won the Secretary of Defense PBL-ofthe-year award.\n\nPratt &amp; Whitney. Pratt &amp; Whitney is among the world's leading suppliers of aircraft engines for commercial, military, business jet and general aviation customers. Pratt &amp; Whitney's Commercial Engines and Military Engines businesses design, develop, produce and maintain families of large engines for wide- and narrow-body and large regional aircraft for commercial customers and for fighter,  bomber, tanker and transport aircraft for military customers. Pratt &amp; Whitney's small engine business, Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada (P&amp;WC), is among the world's leading suppliers of engines powering regional airlines, general and business aviation, as well  as  helicopters.  Pratt  &amp;  Whitney  also  produces,  sells  and  services  military  and  commercial  auxiliary  power  units.  Pratt  &amp; Whitney provides fleet management services and aftermarket maintenance, repair and overhaul services in all of these segments.\n\nPratt  &amp;  Whitney  sells  products  and  services  principally  to  aircraft  manufacturers,  airlines  and  other  aircraft  operators,  aircraft leasing companies and the U.S. and foreign governments. Pratt &amp; Whitney's largest commercial customer by sales is Airbus, with sales, prior to discounts and incentives, of 31%, 30% and 31% of total Pratt &amp; Whitney segment sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nPratt &amp; Whitney produces the PW1000G Geared Turbofan (GTF) engine family, the first of which, the PW1100G-JM, entered into service in January 2016. The PW1000G GTF engine has demonstrated a significant reduction in fuel burn and noise levels and lower environmental emissions when compared to legacy engines. The PW1100G-JM engine is offered on the Airbus A320neo family of aircraft. PW1000G GTF engine models also power the Airbus A220 passenger aircraft and Embraer's E-Jet E2 family of aircraft and have been certified by the Russian civil aviation authority to power the Irkut MC-21 passenger aircraft. In addition, P&amp;WC's PW800 engine has been selected to exclusively power Gulfstream's G400, G500 and G600 business jets, as well as to power Dassault's Falcon 6X business jet, which is scheduled to enter into service in 2022.\n\nPratt &amp; Whitney is under contract to produce and sustain the F135 engine for the U.S. government's F-35 Joint Program Office to power the single-engine F-35 Lightning II aircraft (commonly known as the Joint Strike Fighter) produced by Lockheed Martin. F135 propulsion system configurations are used for the U.S Air Force's F-35A, the U.S. Marine Corps' F-35B and the U.S. Navy's F-35C jets. F135 engines are also used on F-35 aircraft purchased by Joint Strike Fighter partner countries and other countries through foreign military sales arrangements. Pratt &amp; Whitney is also under contract to build engines for the U.S. Air Force's B-21 long-range strike bomber and to develop next-generation adaptive engines for the U.S. Air Force.\n\nThe development of new engines and improvements to current production engines present important growth opportunities for Pratt &amp; Whitney. In view of the risks and costs associated with developing new engines, Pratt &amp; Whitney has entered into collaboration arrangements in which revenues, costs and risks are shared with third parties. At December 31, 2021, the interests of third-party collaboration participants in Pratt &amp; Whitney-directed jet engine programs ranged, in the aggregate per program, from 13% to 49%. See 'Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles' within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a description of our  accounting  for  collaboration  arrangements.  Pratt  &amp;  Whitney  also  continues  to  enhance  its  programs  through  performance improvement measures and product base expansion, utilizing similar collaboration arrangements.\n\nIn  2021,  Pratt  &amp;  Whitney  reached  significant  milestones  on  the  GTF  engine  program,  including  the  first  flight  of  the  GTF Advantage engine for the A320neo family. The GTF Advantage configuration further extends the economic and environmental benefits of the existing GTF engine, as it reduces fuel consumption by an additional 1 percent, extending the engine's lead as the most efficient powerplant for the A320neo family. The GTF family now powers more than 1,100 aircraft across 58 airlines and three  aircraft  platforms: Airbus A320neo  family, Airbus A220  and  Embraer  E-Jets  E2. Also  in  2021,  Pratt  &amp; Whitney's V2500 program achieved 250 million flight hours. Pratt &amp; Whitney was announced as the engine provider on the Dassault Falcon 6X and Gulfstream  G400,  representing  two  new  platforms  for  its  PW800  engine.  In  addition,  Pratt  &amp;  Whitney  received  a  significant number of contract awards for the F135 program, which powers all three variants of the F-35 Lightning II fighter aircraft and achieved several F135 production milestones, including the delivery of the 800th production engine and continuing to add more F135 engine maintenance, repair, overhaul and upgrade (MRO&amp;U) global capacity by activating MRO&amp;U facilities, or depots, in the Netherlands and Australia. Significant activity continued on development programs, including testing the first XA101 engine as part of the Adaptive Engine Transition Program.",

Actual  results  could  differ  from  those  estimates,  and  any  such differences may be material to our Consolidated Financial statements.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term cash investments that  are  highly  liquid  in  nature  and  have  original  maturities  of  three  months  or  less. The  estimated  fair  value  of  Cash  and  cash equivalents approximates the carrying value due to their short maturities.\n\nAccounts Receivable. Accounts receivable are stated at the net amount expected to be collected. We are exposed to credit losses primarily on our accounts receivable and contract assets related to our sales of products and services to commercial customers. The allowance for expected credit losses is established to provide for the expected lifetime credit losses by evaluating factors such as customer  creditworthiness,  historical  payment  and  loss  experiences,  current  economic  conditions,  including  geographic  and political risk, and the age and status of outstanding receivables. In certain circumstances, we may be able to develop reasonable and supportable forecasts over the contractual term of the financial asset. For periods beyond which we are able to make or obtain reasonable and supportable forecasts, we revert to historical loss experience and information.\n\nWe determine credit ratings for each customer in our portfolio based upon public information and information obtained directly from our customers. We conduct a review of customer credit ratings, published historical credit default rates for different rating categories,  and  multiple  third-party  aircraft  value  publications  as  a  basis  to  validate  the  reasonableness  of  the  allowance  for expected  credit  losses  on  a  quarterly  basis,  or  when  events  and  circumstances  warrant.  A  credit  limit  is  established  for  each customer based on the outcome of this review and consideration of the other factors discussed above. In certain cases, we may require collateral or prepayment to mitigate credit risk.\n\nExpected credit losses are written off in the period in which the financial asset is no longer collectible.\n\nUnbilled receivables represent revenues that are not currently billable to the customer under the terms of the contract and include unbilled amounts under commercial contracts where payment is solely subject to the passage of time. These items are expected to be billed and collected in the normal course of business. Accounts receivable as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 includes unbilled receivables  of  $342  million  and  $228  million,  respectively,  which  primarily  includes  unbilled  receivables  with  commercial aerospace customers. Other unbilled receivables where payment is subject to factors beyond just the passage of time are included in Contract assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and are generally classified as current.\n\nContract Assets and Liabilities. Contract assets and liabilities represent the difference in the timing of revenue recognition from receipt of cash from our customers. Contract assets reflect revenue recognized and performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in advance of customer billing.\n\nContract  liabilities  relate  to  payments  received  in  advance  of  the  satisfaction  of  performance  under  the  contract.  We  receive payments from customers based on the terms established in our contracts.\n\nContract assets and Contract liabilities are generally classified as current as our operating cycle is generally longer than one year. See 'Note 6: Contract Assets and Liabilities' for further discussion of Contract assets and liabilities.\n\nAs described in more detail above in 'Accounts Receivable,' we are exposed to credit losses on our contract assets related to our sales of products and services to commercial customers and regularly assess our allowance for expected credit losses as it relates to our Contract assets.\n\nInventory. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value and is primarily based on first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost methods.\n\nValuation reserves for excess, obsolete, and slow-moving inventory are estimated by comparing the inventory levels of individual parts to both future sales forecasts or production requirements and historical usage rates in order to identify inventory where the resale  value  or  replacement  value  is  less  than  inventoriable  cost.  Other  factors  that  management  considers  in  determining  the adequacy of these reserves include whether individual inventory parts meet current specifications and can be substituted for a part currently  being  sold  or  used  as  a  service  part,  overall  market  conditions,  and  other  inventory  management  initiatives. Manufacturing costs are allocated to current production contracts. In our commercial aerospace businesses, excess costs beyond standard manufacturing costs are expensed when they meet certain thresholds.\n\nEquity Method Investments. Investments in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but do not control, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Under this  method  of  accounting,  our  share  of  the  net  earnings  or  losses  of  the  investee  is  included  in  Other  income,  net  on  the Consolidated Statement of Operations since the activities of the investee are closely aligned with the operations of the business segment holding the investment. We evaluate our equity method investments whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that  the  carrying  amounts  of  such  investments  may  be  impaired.  If  a  decline  in  the  value  of  an  equity  method  investment  is determined to be other than temporary, a loss is recorded in earnings in the current period. Our sales to and",

      "answer": "Boeing expects commercial air travel to return to 2019 levels between 2023 and 2024, with a few more years needed to return to long-term trend growth. This delayed recovery directly affects airline demand for new aircraft and services, which in turn impacts Raytheon Technologies\u2019 commercial aerospace business. Raytheon reported valuation reserves of $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2021, specifically tied to the commercial aerospace sector, reflecting the ongoing uncertainty and reduced demand from airline and airframer customers due to the pandemic. These reserves and off-balance sheet exposures remain under close monitoring by Raytheon due to the continued impact of the slow recovery in commercial air travel.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nAirline financial performance, which also plays a role in the demand for new capacity, has been adversely impacted by the  COVID-19  pandemic. According  to  IATA,  net  losses  for  the  airline  industry  were  $138  billion  in  2020  and  are expected to be approximately $52 billion in 2021. Our customers are taking actions to combat the effects of the COVID19 pandemic on the market by preserving liquidity. This comes in many forms, such as deferrals of advances and other payments  to  suppliers,  deferrals  of  deliveries,  reduced  spending  on  services  and,  in  some  cases,  cancellation  of orders. While the outlook is improving and we have seen an increase in new orders in 2021, we continue to face a challenging environment in the near- to medium-term as airlines have adjusted to reduced traffic, which in turn has resulted in lower demand for commercial aerospace products and services. The current environment is also affecting the financial viability of some airlines.\n\nWe continue to expect commercial air travel to return to 2019 levels in 2023 to 2024. We expect it will take a few years beyond that for the industry to return to long-term trend growth. To balance the supply and demand given the COVID19 shock and to preserve our long-term potential and competitiveness, we have reduced the production rates of several of our BCA programs. These rate decisions are based on our ongoing assessments of the demand environment and availability  of  aircraft  financing. There  is  significant  uncertainty  with  respect  to  when  commercial air traffic levels will recover, and whether, and at what point, capacity will return to and/or exceed pre-COVID-19 levels. During the fourth quarter  of  2020,  we  made  adjustments  to  our  estimates  regarding  timing  of  777X  entry  into  service  and  market demand. We continue to anticipate that the first 777X delivery will occur in late 2023. We will closely monitor the key factors  that  affect  backlog  and  future  demand  for  each  of  our  commercial  aircraft  programs,  including  customers' evolving  fleet  plans,  the  wide-body  replacement  cycle  and  the  cargo  market.  We  will  maintain  a  disciplined  rate management process and make adjustments as appropriate in the future. Notwithstanding the changes we have made to production rates, risk remains that further reductions will be required. Additionally, if we are unable to make timely deliveries of the large number of aircraft in inventory as of December 31, 2021, future revenues, earnings and cash flows will be adversely impacted.\n\nDeliveries  of  the  737  MAX  resumed  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020,  when  the  Federal Aviation Administration  (FAA) rescinded the order that grounded 737 MAX aircraft in the U.S. In addition, other non-U.S. civil aviation authorities, including  the  Brazilian  National  Civil  Aviation  Agency,  Transport  Canada  and  the  European  Union  Aviation  Safety Agency have subsequently approved return of operations, allowing us to resume deliveries in those jurisdictions. Over 185 countries have approved the resumption of 737 MAX operations. The Civil Aviation Administration of China issued an airworthiness directive in the fourth quarter of 2021 outlining actions required for airlines to return to service. We expect 737 MAX deliveries to China to resume in 2022, subject to final regulatory approvals, although risk remains around the timing and rate of those deliveries. Orders to suspend operations of 737 MAX aircraft from non-U.S. civil aviation authorities are still in effect in a small number of countries.\n\nDeliveries  and  production  have  also  been  impacted  by  production  issues  and  associated  rework.  For  example, deliveries  of  the  787  are  currently  paused  and  the  production  rate  has  been  reduced  while  we  focus  on  rework  of undelivered  aircraft  and  continue  to  engage  in  detailed  discussions  with  the  FAA  regarding  required  actions  for resuming deliveries. Risk remains that these issues may continue to impact the timing of airplane deliveries in inventory and/or our ability to achieve planned production rates. Revenues, earnings and cash flows will continue to be impacted until we are able to resume timely deliveries.",

As  a  result  of  COVID-19,  governments,  businesses  and  individuals  have  taken  actions  such  as  instituting  lockdowns, quarantines, border closings and other travel restrictions and requirements, adopting remote working and reducing business and leisure travel, which collectively led to an unprecedented decline in demand for commercial air travel. The unprecedented decrease in air travel adversely affected our airline and airframer customers and their demand for our products and services of our Collins Aerospace and Pratt &amp; Whitney businesses.

Some of these programs hav e cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily reduced award or incentiv e fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense, Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.\n\nSome of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Examples of significant fixed-price dev elopment programs include Commercial Crew,  KC-46A  T anker,  MQ-25,  T -7A  Red  Hawk,  VC-25B,  and  commercial  and  military  satellites. A  number  of  our  ongoing  fixed-price  dev elopment programs have reach-forward losses. New programs could also hav e risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. Many development programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during dev elopment, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result  in  a  material  charge  or  otherwise  adv ersely  affect  our  financial  condition.  T hese  programs  are  ongoing,  and  while  we  believ e  the  cost  and  fee estimates  incorporated  in  the  financial  statements  are  appropriate,  the  technical  complexity  of  these  programs  creates  financial  risk  as  additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled deliv ery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination prov isions or other financially significant exposure. Risk remains that we may be required to record additional reach-forward losses in future periods.\n\n## Global Services\n\n## Business Environment and Trends\n\nThe aerospace markets we serve include parts distribution, logistics and other inv entory serv ices; maintenance, engineering and upgrades; training and professional  serv ices;  and  data  analytics  and  digital  serv ices.

Potential  pension  contributions  include  both  mandatory  amounts required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and discretionary contributions to improv e the plans' funded status. The extent of future contributions depends heav ily on market factors such as the discount rate and the actual return on plan assets. We estimate future contributions to these  plans  using  assumptions  with  respect  to  these  and  other  items.  Changes  to  those  assumptions  could  hav e  a  significant  effect  on  future contributions as well as on our annual pension costs and/or result in a significant change to shareholders' equity. For U.S. gov ernment contracts, we allocate pension costs to indiv idual contracts based on U.S. Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which can also affect contract profitability. We also prov ide  other  postretirement  benefits  to  certain  of  our  employees,  consisting  principally  of  health  care  cov erage  for  eligible  retirees  and  qualifying dependents. Our estimates of future costs associated with these benefits are also subject to assumptions, including estimates of the lev el of medical cost increases. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement plan accounting policies, see 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Pension Plans' on page 51 of this Form 10-K. Although under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP) the timing of periodic pension and other postretirement benefit expense and plan contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or stock we would contribute to our plans.\n\n## Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures.\n\nWe  are  exposed  to  liabilities  that  are  unique  to  the  products  and  serv ices  we  prov ide.  We  maintain  insurance  for  certain  risks  and,  in  some circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the U.S. gov ernment. The amount of our insurance cov erage may not cov er all claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear substantial costs. For example, liabilities arising from the use of certain of our products, such as aircraft technologies, space systems, spacecraft, satellites, missile systems, weapons, cybersecurity, border security systems, anti-terrorism technologies and/or air traffic management systems may not be insurable on commercially reasonable terms. While some of these products are shielded from liability within the U.S. under the SAFETY Act provisions of the 2002 Homeland Security Act, no such protection is av ailable outside the U.S., potentially resulting in significant liabilities. T he amount of insurance cov erage we maintain may be inadequate to cov er these or other claims or liabilities.\n\n## A significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in certain types of Boeing aircraft, which exposes us to concentration risks.\n\nA significant  portion  of  our  customer  financing  portfolio,  which  is  comprised  of  financing  receiv ables  and  operating  lease  equipment,  is  concentrated among certain customers and in distinct geographic regions.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Our estimates and projections may prove to be inaccurate and certain of our assets may be at risk of future impairment.\n\nThe accounting for some of our most significant activities is based on judgments and estimates, which are complex and subject to many variables. For example, accounting for sales using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method requires that we assess risks and make assumptions regarding future schedule, cost, technical and performance issues for thousands of contracts, many of which are long-term in nature. This process can be especially difficult when estimating costs for  development programs because of the inherent uncertainty in developing a new product or technology.  Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes involved in accounting for our contracts, materially different amounts of revenue and operating profit could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, we initially allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses based on a preliminary assessment of the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For acquisitions we may use a one-year measurement period to analyze and assess several factors used in establishing the asset and liability fair values as of the acquisition date which could result in adjustments to asset and liability balances.\n\nWe have $11.1 billion of goodwill assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024 from previous acquisitions, which represents approximately 20% of our total assets. These goodwill assets are subject to annual impairment testing and more frequent testing upon the occurrence of certain events or significant changes in circumstances that indicate goodwill may be impaired. If we experience changes or factors arise that negatively affect the expected cash flows of a reporting unit, we may be required to write off all or a portion of the reporting unit's related goodwill assets.\n\nActual financial results could differ from our judgments and estimates. See 'Critical Accounting Policies' in the MD&amp;A and Results of Operations and 'Note 1 Organization  and  Significant  Accounting  Policies'  included  in  our  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  a  complete  discussion  of  our  significant accounting policies and use of estimates.\n\n## Changes in tax laws and regulations or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial results.\n\nChanges in U.S. (federal or state) or foreign tax  laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including those with retroactive effect, could result in increases in our tax  ex pense and affect profitability and cash flows. For ex ample, beginning in 2022, the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures immediately in the year incurred and requires taxpayers to amortize such expenditures over five years for tax purposes (research and development capitalization). While the most significant impact of this provision was to cash tax liability for 2022, the tax year in which the provision took effect, the impact will continue over the five-year amortization period, but decline to an immaterial amount in year six .\n\nThe  amount  of  net  deferred  tax   assets  will  change  periodically  based  on  several  factors,  including  the  measurement  of  our  postretirement  benefit  plan obligations, actual cash contributions to our postretirement benefit plans, change in the amount or reevaluation of uncertain tax positions, and future changes in tax laws. In addition, we are regularly under audit or examination by tax authorities, including foreign tax authorities. The final resolution of tax audits and any related administrative reviews or litigation could result in unanticipated increases in our tax  ex pense and changes to the timing of required tax  payments, which could affect profitability  and  cash  flows  for  any  particular  reporting  period.  These  increases  or  changes  could  have  a  material  impact  on  financial  condition  and  results  of operations in such period.\n\n## Our business involves significant risks and uncertainties that may not be covered by indemnity or insurance.\n\nA significant  portion  of  our  business  relates  to  designing,  developing  and  manufacturing  advanced  defense  and  technology  products  and  systems.  New technologies may be untested or unproven. Failure of some of these products and services could result in extensive loss of life or property damage. Accordingly, we may incur liabilities that are unique to our products and services. In some but not all circumstances, we may be entitled to certain legal protections or indemnifications from our customers, either through U.S. G overnment indemnifications under Public Law 85-804, 10 U.S.C. 3861, the Commercial Space Launch Act or the PriceAnderson Act, qualification of our products and services by the Department of Homeland Security under the SAFETY  Act provisions of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, contractual provisions or otherwise.\n\nWe seek to obtain insurance coverage from established and reputable insurance carriers to the extent available in order to cover these risks and liabilities. However, the amount of insurance coverage that we maintain or that is available to purchase in the market may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities and we may self-insure certain types of risk. Insurance coverage is subject to the terms and conditions of the insurance contract and is further subject to any sublimits, exclusions, restrictions, or defenses, including standard exclusions for acts of war. Ex isting coverage is renewed annually and may be canceled pursuant to the terms of the policies while we remain exposed to the risk and it is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all operational risks, natural hazards and liabilities. For example, we are limited in the amount of insurance we",

Net unfav orable cumulativ e contract catch-up adjustments were $2,328 million better than in 2022.\n\nSee further discussion of fixed-price contracts in Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nBDS loss from operations includes our share of income from equity method inv estments of $125 million, $44 million and $13 million primarily from our United Launch Alliance and other joint v entures in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectiv ely.\n\n## Backlog\n\nT otal backlog of $64,023 million at December 31, 2024 was $5,011 million higher than December 31, 2023, reflecting the timing of awards, partially offset by rev enue recognized on contracts awarded in prior periods.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\nOur BDS business includes a variety of dev elopment programs which hav e complex design and technical challenges. Some of these programs hav e cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily reduced award or incentiv e fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense, Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.\n\nSome of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Examples of significant fixed-price dev elopment programs include Commercial Crew,  KC-46A  T anker,  MQ-25,  T -7A  Red  Hawk,  VC-25B,  and  commercial  and  military  satellites. A  number  of  our  ongoing  fixed-price  dev elopment programs have reach-forward losses. New programs could also hav e risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. Many development programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during dev elopment, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result  in  a  material  charge  or  otherwise  adv ersely  affect  our  financial  condition.  T hese  programs  are  ongoing,  and  while  we  believ e  the  cost  and  fee estimates  incorporated  in  the  financial  statements  are  appropriate,  the  technical  complexity  of  these  programs  creates  financial  risk  as  additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled deliv ery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination prov isions or other financially significant exposure. Risk remains that we may be required to record additional reach-forward losses in future periods.\n\n## Global Services\n\n## Business Environment and Trends\n\nThe aerospace markets we serve include parts distribution, logistics and other inv entory serv ices; maintenance, engineering and upgrades; training and professional  serv ices;  and  data  analytics  and  digital  serv ices.  We  expect  BGS  commercial  rev enues  to  remain  strong  in  future  quarters  as  the commercial airline industry transitions from recov ery to growth.\n\nOver  the  long-term,  as  the  size  of  the  worldwide  commercial  airline  fleet  continues  to  grow ,  so  does  demand  for  aftermarket  serv ices  designed  to increase efficiency and extend the economic liv es of aircraft. Airlines are using data analytics to plan flight operations and predictiv e maintenance to improve their productiv ity and efficiency.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nEquity method investments - Investments where we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but do not control, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are included in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Significant influence typically exists if we have a 20% to 50% ownership interest in the investee. Under this method of accounting, our share of the net earnings or losses of the investee is included in operating profit in other income, net on our consolidated statements of earnings since the activities of the investee are closely aligned with the operations of the business segment holding the investment. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such investments may be impaired. If a decline in the value of an equity method investment is determined to be other than temporary, a loss is recorded in earnings in the current period. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our equity method investments totaled $654 million and $701 million, which was primarily composed of our investment in the United Launch Alliance (ULA) joint venture. Our share of net earnings related to our equity method investees was $56 million in 2024, $40 million in 2023 and $114 million in 2022, of which approx imately $45 million, $20 million and $100 million was included in our Space business segment operating profit.\n\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets - We perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. We may use both a qualitative and quantitative approaches when testing goodwill for impairment. For selected reporting units where we use the qualitative approach, we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment. Based on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further evaluation is necessary. Otherwise, we perform a quantitative impairment test. We perform quantitative tests for most reporting units at least once every three years. However, for certain reporting units we may perform a quantitative impairment test every year.\n\nTo perform the quantitative impairment test we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, ex ceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and market-based valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading values and values observed in recent business acquisitions.\n\nFinite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over their applicable useful lives, ranging from three  to 20 years, based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic benefit as reflected by future net cash inflows. Acquired intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment testing or more frequently if events or change in circumstance indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. We perform an impairment test of finite-lived intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may be impaired.\n\nLeases - We evaluate whether our contractual arrangements contain leases at the inception of such arrangements. Specifically, we consider whether we can control the underlying asset and have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits or outputs from the asset. Substantially all of our leases are longterm operating leases with fix ed payment terms. We do not have significant financing leases. Our right-of-use (ROU) operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and our operating lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments. ROU operating lease assets are recorded in other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities are recorded in other current liabilities  or other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet based on their contractual due dates.\n\nBoth the ROU operating lease asset and liability are recognized as of the lease commencement date at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. Most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate that can readily be determined. Therefore, we use a discount rate based on our incremental borrowing rate, which is determined using our credit rating and information available as of the commencement date. ROU operating lease assets include lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, net of any lease incentives.\n\nOur operating lease agreements may include options to extend the lease term or terminate it early. We include options to extend or terminate leases in the ROU operating lease asset and liability when it is reasonably certain we will ex ercise these options. Operating lease ex pense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in cost of sales on our consolidated statement of earnings.\n\nWe have operating lease arrangements with lease and non-lease components. The non-lease components in our arrangements are not significant when compared to the lease components. For all operating leases, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single component. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to",

Moreover, depending on the severity of an incident, our customers' data, our employees' data, our intellectual property (including trade secrets and research, development and engineering know-how) and other third-party data (such as that of subcontractors, suppliers and vendors) could be compromised, which could adversely affect our business. Products and services we provide to customers also carry cybersecurity risks, including risks that they could be breached or fail to detect, prevent or combat attacks, which could result in losses to our customers and claims against us, and could harm our relationships with our customers and financial results.\n\nGiven the persistence, sophistication, volume and novelty of threats we face, we may not be successful in preventing or mitigating an attack that could have a material adverse effect on us and the costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. The national  security  aspects  of  our  business  and  much  of  the  data  we  protect  increase  and  create  different  risks  relative  to  other  industries.  National  security considerations may also preclude us from publicly disclosing a cybersecurity incident.\n\nOur customers (including sites that we operate and manage for our customers), suppliers, subcontractors, joint venture partners and acquired entities face similar security threats and an incident at one of these entities could adversely impact our business. These entities are typically outside our control and may have access to our information with varying levels of security and cybersecurity resources, expertise, safeguards and capabilities. Their relationships with government contractors, including us, may increase the risk that they are targeted by the same threats we face, however, they may not be as prepared for such threats. Adversaries actively seek to exploit security and cybersecurity weaknesses in our supply chain. Breaches in our multi-tiered supply chain, which is comprised of thousands of direct and indirect  suppliers,  have  and  could  in  the  future  compromise  our  data  and  adversely  affect  customer  deliverables.  We  also  must  rely  on  our  supply  chain  for adequately detecting and reporting cyber incidents, which could affect our ability to report or respond to cybersecurity incidents effectively or in a timely manner.\n\nFor information on our cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance, see Item 1C. - Cybersecurity.\n\n## If we fail to successfully complete or manage acquisitions, divestitures, equity investments and other transactions or if acquired entities or equity investments fail to perform as expected, our financial results, business and future prospects could be harmed.\n\nIn pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate companies, and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, joint ventures, other investments and divestitures. We seek to identify acquisition or investment opportunities that will expand or complement our existing products and services or customer base, at reasonable valuations. To be successful, we must conduct due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss contingencies or underlying risks, some of which are difficult to discover or assess prior to consummation of an acquisition or investment; negotiate transaction terms; complete and close complex transactions; integrate acquired companies and employees; and realize anticipated operating synergies efficiently and effectively. U.S. regulators have increased their scrutiny of mergers and acquisitions in recent years, which could continue to limit our ability to execute certain transactions that we might otherwise pursue.\n\nAcquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and investments often require substantial management resources and have the potential to divert our attention from our existing business. Unidentified or identified but uncertain liabilities that are not covered by indemnification or other coverage could adversely affect our future financial results. This is particularly the case in respect of successor liability under procurement laws and regulations such as the False Claims Act or the Truthful Cost or Pricing Data Act (formerly the Truth in Negotiations Act), anti-corruption, environmental, tax, import-export and technology transfer laws, which provide for civil and criminal penalties and the potential for debarment. We also may incur unanticipated costs or expenses, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, employee retention, transaction-related or other litigation, and other liabilities. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\nJoint ventures and other noncontrolling investments operate under shared control with other parties. These investments typically face many of the same risks and uncertainties as we do, but may expose us to additional risks not present if we retained full control.

Net unfav orable cumulativ e contract catch-up adjustments were $2,328 million better than in 2022.\n\nSee further discussion of fixed-price contracts in Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nBDS loss from operations includes our share of income from equity method inv estments of $125 million, $44 million and $13 million primarily from our United Launch Alliance and other joint v entures in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectiv ely.\n\n## Backlog\n\nT otal backlog of $64,023 million at December 31, 2024 was $5,011 million higher than December 31, 2023, reflecting the timing of awards, partially offset by rev enue recognized on contracts awarded in prior periods.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\nOur BDS business includes a variety of dev elopment programs which hav e complex design and technical challenges. Some of these programs hav e cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily reduced award or incentiv e fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense, Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.\n\nSome of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Examples of significant fixed-price dev elopment programs include Commercial Crew,  KC-46A  T anker,  MQ-25,  T -7A  Red  Hawk,  VC-25B,  and  commercial  and  military  satellites. A  number  of  our  ongoing  fixed-price  dev elopment programs have reach-forward losses. New programs could also hav e risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. Many development programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during dev elopment, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result  in  a  material  charge  or  otherwise  adv ersely  affect  our  financial  condition.  T hese  programs  are  ongoing,  and  while  we  believ e  the  cost  and  fee estimates  incorporated  in  the  financial  statements  are  appropriate,  the  technical  complexity  of  these  programs  creates  financial  risk  as  additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled deliv ery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination prov isions or other financially significant exposure. Risk remains that we may be required to record additional reach-forward losses in future periods.\n\n## Global Services\n\n## Business Environment and Trends\n\nThe aerospace markets we serve include parts distribution, logistics and other inv entory serv ices; maintenance, engineering and upgrades; training and professional  serv ices;  and  data  analytics  and  digital  serv ices.  We  expect  BGS  commercial  rev enues  to  remain  strong  in  future  quarters  as  the commercial airline industry transitions from recov ery to growth.\n\nOver  the  long-term,  as  the  size  of  the  worldwide  commercial  airline  fleet  continues  to  grow ,  so  does  demand  for  aftermarket  serv ices  designed  to increase efficiency and extend the economic liv es of aircraft. Airlines are using data analytics to plan flight operations and predictiv e maintenance to improve their productiv ity and efficiency. Airlines continue to look for opportunities to reduce the size and cost of their spare parts inv entory, frequently outsourcing spares management to third parties.",

The following discussion of material  changes  in  our  consolidated  net  sales  should  be  read  in  tandem  with  the  subsequent  discussion  of  changes  in  our consolidated cost of sales and our business segment results of operations because changes in our sales are typically accompanied by a corresponding change in our cost of sales due to the nature of the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method.\n\n## Product Sales\n\nProduct sales increased $1.5 billion, or 3%, in 2021 as compared to 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to higher product sales of approximately $735 million at RMS due to higher production volume on various Sikorsky helicopter programs and for training and logistics solutions (TLS) programs due to the delivery of an international pilot training system; $465 million at MFC  due  to  higher  volume  on  PAC-3,  Long  Range  Anti-Ship  Missile  (LRASM)  and  Joint  Air-to-Surface  Standoff  Missile (JASSM) programs; and $305 million at Aeronautics due to higher volume on classified contracts and F-16 production contracts, partially offset by lower volume on F-35 development contracts.\n\n## Service Sales\n\nService  sales  increased  $139  million,  or  1%,  in  2021  as  compared  to  2020.  The  increase  in  service  sales  was  primarily attributable to higher sales of approximately $180 million at Aeronautics due to higher sustainment volume on F-35, partially offset by lower sustainment volume on F-22.\n\n## Cost of Sales\n\nCost of sales, for both products and services, consist of materials, labor, subcontracting costs and an allocation of indirect costs (overhead and general and administrative), as well as the costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred  to  as  offset  agreements,  required  under  certain  contracts  with  international  customers.

The  stated  values  of  these  letters  of  credit  agreements  and  surety  bonds  totaled  $3.9  billion  as  of December 31, 2021.\n\nOffset Obligations. We have entered into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes in the form of either offset agreements or ICIP agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries. At December  31,  2021,  the  aggregate  amount  of  our  offset  agreements,  both  agreed  to  and  anticipated  to  be  agreed  to,  had  an outstanding notional value of approximately $10.3 billion. These agreements are designed to return economic value to the foreign country by requiring us to engage in activities supporting local defense or commercial industries, promoting a balance of trade, developing in-country technology capabilities or addressing other local development priorities. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require a direct cash payment, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing, training and other consulting support to in-country projects, and the purchase by third parties (e.g., our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements may also be satisfied through our use of cash for activities such as subcontracting with local partners, purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects and making investments in local ventures. Such activities may also vary by country depending upon requirements as dictated by their governments. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customers and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the  notional  value  in  the  offset  agreements.  Offset  programs  usually  extend  over  several  or  more  years  and  may  provide  for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements.

Raytheon Technologies (RTX), on the other hand, incorporates the estimated cost of satisfying industrial cooperation agreements into its Estimate at Completion (EAC) process for contracts, particularly within its RIS and RMD segments. RTX reviews EACs periodically and adjusts estimates based on management judgment, including variables like subcontractor execution, funding availability, and technical performance.

Such amounts mainly include expected payments under non-qualified pension plans, environmental liabilities and deferred compensation plans.\n\nPurchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages.

The U.S. Government generally would be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related contracts 'for convenience' under the FAR, subject to available funding. This also would be true in cases where we perform subcontract work for a prime contractor under a U.S. Government contract. The termination for convenience language also may be included in contracts with foreign, state and local governments.

Expenditures  for  equipment  and  facilities  infrastructure  are  generally  incurred  to  support  new  and  existing programs  across  all  of  our  business  segments.  For  example,  we  have  projects  underway  at  Aeronautics  to  support  classified development programs and at RMS to support our Sikorsky helicopter programs; and we have projects underway to modernize certain of our facilities.

The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided under U.S. government contracts. The pricing for non-U.S. government contracts is based on the specific negotiations with each customer. Under the typical payment terms of our U.S. government fixed-price contracts, the customer pays us either performance-based payments (PBPs) or progress payments. PBPs are interim payments equal to a negotiated percentage of the contract price based on quantifiable measures of performance or on the achievement of specified events or milestones. Progress payments are interim payments up to 80-90% of costs incurred as the work progresses. Because the customer retains a portion of the contract price until completion of the contract, our U.S. government fixed-price contracts generally result in revenue recognized in excess of billings which we present as Contract assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For our U.S. government cost-type contracts, the customer generally pays us for our costs incurred within a short period of time. For non-U.S. government contracts, we typically receive interim payments as work progresses, although for some contracts, we may be entitled to receive an advance payment.  Such  advances  are  not  considered  a  significant  financing  component  because  they  are  used  to  meet  working  capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract and to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. We recognize a liability for advance payments in excess of revenue recognized and present it as Contract liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nFor certain of our long-term aftermarket contracts, revenue is recognized over the contract period. We generally account for such contracts as a series of daily performance obligations to stand ready to provide spare parts, product maintenance and aftermarket services. These arrangements include the sale of spare parts with integral services to our customers, and are generally classified as Services sales, with the corresponding costs classified in Cost of sales - services, within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Revenue is primarily recognized on a percentage of completion basis using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress, as sufficient historical evidence indicates that the cost of performing services under the contract is incurred on an other-than-straight-line basis. For some of our long-term aftermarket contracts, we receive payment prior to delivery of products and services, resulting in a contract liability balance, while for others, we deliver products or services in advance of payment, resulting in a contract asset balance.\n\nContracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications or requirements. We consider contract modifications to exist when the modification either creates new or changes existing enforceable rights and obligations. Contract modifications for goods or services that are not distinct are accounted for as part of the existing contract either on a cumulative catch-up basis or prospective basis depending on the nature of the modification.\n\nLoss provisions on contracts are recognized to the extent that estimated contract costs exceed the estimated consideration from the products or services contemplated under the contractual arrangement. For new commitments, we generally record loss provisions at contract signing except for certain contracts under which losses are recorded upon receipt of the purchase order that obligates us to perform. For existing commitments, anticipated losses on contractual arrangements are recognized in the period in which losses become evident. In estimating losses, products contemplated under contractual arrangements include firm quantities of product sold under contract and, in the commercial engine and wheels and brakes businesses, future highly probable sales of replacement parts required by regulation that are expected to be sold subsequently for incorporation into the original equipment. In our commercial engine  and  wheels  and  brakes  businesses,  when  the  OEM  product  is  sold  for  a  loss,  but  the  combined  OEM  and  aftermarket arrangement for each individual sales campaign is profitable, we record OEM product losses at the time of product delivery.\n\nWe review our Estimate at Completion (EACs) on significant contracts on a periodic basis and for others, no less than annually or when  a  change  in  circumstances  warrant  a  modification  to  a  previous  estimate.  Due  to  the  nature  of  the  work  required  to  be performed on many of the Company's performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment by management on a contract by contract basis. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. The risks  and  opportunities  relate  to  management's  judgment  about  the  ability  and  cost  to  achieve  the  schedule,  consideration  of customer-directed delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries, technical requirements, customer activity levels, such as flight hours or  aircraft  landings,  and  related  variable  consideration.  Management's  judgment  related  to  these  considerations  has  become increasingly more significant given the economic environment primarily caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenue and costs, including estimates of labor productivity and availability, the complexity  and  scope  of  the  work  to  be  performed,  the  availability  and  cost  of  materials,  the  length  of  time  to  complete  the performance obligation, execution by our subcontractors, the availability and timing of funding from our customer, overhead cost rates, and current and past maintenance cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful lives  of  components,  among  others.  Cost  estimates  may  also  include  the  estimated  cost  of  satisfying  our  industrial  cooperation agreements, sometimes in the form of either offset obligations or in-country industrial participation (ICIP) agreements, required under certain contracts primarily within our RIS and RMD",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## International sales may pose different economic, regulatory, competition and other risks.\n\nIn 2021, 28% of our total net sales were from international customers and these sales may grow in the future. International sales are subject to numerous political and economic factors, budget uncertainty, regulatory requirements, significant competition, taxation, and other risks associated with doing business outside the U.S. In international sales, we face substantial competition from both  U.S.  manufacturers  and  international  manufacturers  whose  governments  sometimes  provide  research  and  development assistance, marketing subsidies and other assistance for their products and services.\n\nOur international business is conducted through foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government and by direct commercial sales (DCS) to international customers. FMS contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to the FAR and the DFARS. In contrast, DCS transactions represent sales by us directly to international customers and are not subject to the FAR or the DFARS, although they are subject to the procurement regulations of the international customer. Sales to international customers are subject  to  U.S.  and  foreign  laws  and  regulations,  including  import-export  control,  technology  transfer  restrictions,  investments, taxation,  repatriation  of  earnings,  exchange  controls,  the  Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act  and  other  anti-corruption  laws  and regulations, and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Control Reform Act of 2018. While we have extensive policies in place to comply with such laws and regulations, failure by us, our employees or others working on our behalf to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities, including suspension, debarment from bidding for or performing government contracts, or suspension of our export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We frequently team with international subcontractors and suppliers who also are exposed to similar risks.\n\nInternational  sales  present  risks  that  are  different  and  potentially  greater  than  those  encountered  in  our  U.S.  business.  We believe DCS transactions present the greatest potential risks because they involve direct commercial relationships with parties with whom we typically have less familiarity. Additionally, international procurement and local country rules and regulations, contract laws, and judicial systems differ from those in the U.S. and, in some cases, may be less developed than in the U.S., which could impair our ability to enforce contracts and increase the risk of adverse or unpredictable outcomes, including the possibility that certain matters that would be considered civil matters in the U.S. are treated as criminal matters in other countries.\n\nIn  conjunction  with  defense  procurements,  some  international  customers  require  contractors  to  comply  with  industrial cooperation regulations, including entering into industrial participation or industrial development agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services. Industrial participation or development agreements generally extend over several years and obligate the contractor to perform certain commitments, which may include incountry  purchases,  technology  transfers,  local  manufacturing  support,  consulting  support  to  in-country  projects,  investments  in joint ventures and financial support projects. The customer's expectations in respect of the scope of offset commitments can be substantial, including high-value content, and may exceed existing local technical capability. Failure to meet these commitments, which can be subjective and outside of our control, may result in significant penalties, and could lead to a reduction in sales to a country. Furthermore, certain of our existing industrial development agreements are dependent upon the successful operation of joint ventures that we do not control and involve products and services that are outside of our core business, which may increase the risk that we fail to meet our industrial cooperation agreements, expose us to compliance risks of the joint venture and impair our ability to recover our investment. For more information on our industrial development obligations, including the notional value of our remaining industrial development obligations and potential penalties for non-compliance, see 'Contractual Commitments' in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&amp;A).\n\n## Geopolitical issues and considerations could have a significant effect on our business.\n\nOur international  business  is  highly  sensitive  to  changes  in  regulations  (including  tariffs,  sanctions,  embargoes,  export  and import controls and other trade restrictions), political environments or security risks that may affect our ability to conduct business outside of the U.S., including those regarding investment, procurement, taxation and repatriation of earnings.\n\nOn July 14, 2020 and again on October 26, 2020, the People's Republic of China (China) announced it may impose sanctions against Lockheed Martin in response to Congressional Notifications of potential Foreign Military Sales to Taiwan, which included sales of Lockheed Martin products. We will continue to follow official U.S. Government guidance as it relates to sales to Taiwan and do not see a material impact on our sales at this time. China has not specified the nature of any such sanctions, but could seek to restrict our commercial sales or supply chain, including the supply of rare earth or other raw materials, and could also impose sanctions on our suppliers, teammates or partners. The nature, timing and potential impact of any sanctions that may be imposed by China or any other related actions that may be taken are uncertain.",

Some scarce raw materials required for our products are largely  controlled  by  a  single  country,  including  rare  earth  minerals  that  are  largely  controlled  by  China,  and  therefore  can  be adversely  impacted  by  potential  trade  actions  involving  that  country.  Advanced  microelectronics,  including  semiconductors, underpin many of our current and future critical technologies and platforms and global shortages of these products due to COVID19 or other supply chain challenges could result in increased procurement lead times and costs and potential shortages, which could impact our performance. Additionally, our efforts to increase the efficiency of our operations and improve the affordability of our products and services could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain suppliers. We must comply with specific procurement requirements  that  can  limit  the  source  of  supplies  and  we  do  not  have  secondary  suppliers  for  some  supplies.  Because  the identification and qualification of new or additional suppliers can take an extended period of time, issues with suppliers or trade actions that limit our ability to use certain suppliers can have an adverse impact on our business. Complying with U.S. Government contracting regulations that limit the source or manufacture of suppliers and impose stringent cybersecurity regulations also may create challenges for our supply chain and increase costs.\n\nA failure by one or more of our contracting parties to provide the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services on a timely basis, according to specifications, or at all, may affect our ability to perform our obligations and require that we transition the  work  to  other  companies.  Contracting  party  performance  deficiencies  may  result  in  additional  costs  or  delays  in  product deliveries and affect our operating results and could result in a customer terminating our contract for default or convenience. A default termination could expose us to liability and affect our ability to compete for future contracts and orders.

Our customers' requirements change and evolve regularly. Accordingly, our  future  performance  depends,  in  part,  on  our  ability  to  adapt  to  changing  customer  needs  rapidly,  identify  emerging technological  trends,  develop  and  manufacture  innovative  products  and  services  efficiently  and  bring  those  offerings  to  market quickly at cost-effective prices. This includes efforts to implement emerging digital and network technologies and capabilities. To advance our innovation and position us to meet our customers' requirements, we make investments in emerging technologies that we believe are needed to keep pace with rapid industry innovation and seek to collaborate with commercial entities that we believe have complementary technologies to ours. These entities may not be accustomed to government contracting and may be unwilling to agree to the government's customary terms, including those governing intellectual property. In addition, our relationships and contracts with these commercial entities may present different risks and challenges, including with respect to intellectual property, liability and indemnification terms, than what we are accustomed to with our government customers. Due to the complex and often experimental nature of the products and services we offer, we may experience technical difficulties during the development of new products or technologies. These technical difficulties  could  result  in  delays  and  higher  costs,  which  may  negatively  impact  our financial  results,  and  could  divert  resources  from  other  projects,  until  such  products  or  technologies  are  fully  developed.  See Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details  about  losses  incurred  on  certain  development  programs.  Additionally,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  our  development projects will be successful or meet the needs of our customers.\n\nOur competitors may also develop new technology, or offerings, or more efficient ways to produce existing products that could cause our existing offerings to become obsolete or that could gain market acceptance before our own competitive offerings. If we fail  in  our  development  projects  or  if  our  new  products  or  technologies  fail  to  achieve  customer  acceptance,  we  may  be unsuccessful in obtaining new contracts or winning all or a portion of next generation programs, and this could adversely affect our future performance and financial results. We also may not be successful in our efforts to grow in key areas such as hypersonics, classified programs, and winning next generation franchise programs, which could adversely affect our future performance.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nWe maintain a portfolio of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, licenses and franchises related to our businesses. We rely on  a  combination  of  these  rights,  along  with  nondisclosure  agreements,  information  technology  (IT)  security  systems,  internal controls  and  compliance  systems  and  other  measures  to  protect  our  intellectual  property.  The  U.S.  government  and  foreign governments have licenses to certain of our intellectual property, including certain patents,  which  are  developed  or  used  in  the performance of government contracts. Commercial customers also have licenses to certain of our intellectual property largely in connection with the sale of our products. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each  of  our  businesses,  we  do  not  believe  that  our  business  would  be  materially  affected  by  the  expiration  of  any  particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement.\n\n## Suppliers and Raw Materials\n\nWe  are  dependent  upon  the  availability  of  materials  and  major  components  and  the  performance  of  our  suppliers  and subcontractors.  Some  of  our  products  require  relatively  scarce  raw  materials.  We  generally  have  not  experienced  significant difficulties  in  procuring  the  necessary  raw  materials,  components and other supplies for our products. However, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively impact the global supply chain, as discussed above. Our inability to procure the necessary raw materials, components and other supplies for our products could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. In addition, a significant prolonged increase in inflation could negatively impact the cost of materials and components, particularly with respect to our commercial business operations within Collins Aerospace and Pratt &amp; Whitney. We continuously monitor potential supply chain issues and work with our suppliers and subcontractors to mitigate delays in our receipt of necessary raw materials, components and other supplies, and reduce costs, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on global supply chain. In addition, we monitor supplier liquidity and work continuously with our supply base to ensure an adequate source of supply and to reduce costs. We pursue cost reductions through a number of mechanisms, including consolidating or re-sourcing our purchases, entering long-term agreements, reducing the number of suppliers, strategic global sourcing and competitions among suppliers. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. Like other users in the U.S., we are largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain raw materials, such as cobalt, tantalum, chromium, rhenium and nickel. We have a number of ongoing programs to manage this dependence  and  the  accompanying  risk,  including  long-term  agreements  and  the  conservation  of  materials  through  scrap reclamation  and  new  manufacturing  processes.  In  addition,  in  some  cases,  we  must  comply  with  specific  procurement requirements, which may limit the suppliers and subcontractors we may utilize.\n\n## Regulatory Matters\n\nOur businesses are subject to extensive regulation in the industries we serve. We deal with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities,  including  but  not  limited  to  all  of  the  branches  of  the  U.S.  Department  of  Defense  (DoD),  the  Federal  Aviation Administration (FAA), and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exist in all of the countries in which we do business.\n\nU.S.  Government Contracts. As previously discussed, the U.S. government is our largest customer, representing a substantial majority of our total defense sales. U.S. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for convenience or for default in the event of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. In the case of a termination for convenience, we would  normally  be  entitled  to  reimbursement  for  our  allowable  costs  incurred,  termination  costs  and  a  reasonable  profit.  If terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for payments made to us for undelivered goods or services,  additional  costs  the  government  incurs  in  acquiring  undelivered  goods  or  services  from  another  source  and  any  other damages it suffers. Our U.S. government contracts generally are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which sets forth policies, procedures and requirements for the acquisition of goods and services by the U.S. government; department-specific regulations  that  implement  or  supplement  the  FAR,  such  as  the  DoD's  Defense  Federal  Acquisition  Regulation  Supplement (DFARS); and other applicable laws and regulations. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to government contracting, including various procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination and adjustment, audit and product integrity requirements. A contractor's failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in reductions to the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, cash withholds on contract payments,  forfeiture  of  profits,  and/or  the  assessment  of  civil  or  criminal  penalties  and  fines,  and  could  lead  to  suspension  or debarment, for cause, from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time.\n\nFor further discussion of risks related to government contracting, including on-going litigation associated with U.S. government audits  and  investigations,  see  Item  1A,  'Risk  Factors'  and  Item  3,  'Legal  Proceedings,'  in  this  Form  10-K  and  'Note  19: Commitments and Contingencies' within Item 8 of this Form 10-K.",

          "chunk_text": "## HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\n\n(Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts)\n\nThe Company experienced fluctuations in average resolution values year-over-year in each of the past five years with no well-established trends in either direction. In 2023, the Company observed two consecutive years of increasing average resolution values (2023 and 2022), with more volatility in the earlier years of the fiv e-y ear period (2019 through 2021). Based on these observations, the Company , during its annual review in the fourth quarter of 2023, reevaluated its valuation methodology and elected to give more weight to the two most recent years by shortening the look-back period from five years to two years (2023 and 2022). The Company believes that the average resolution values in the last two consecutive years are likely more representative of expected resolution values in future periods.\n\nIt is not possible to predict whether such resolution values will increase, decrease, or stabilize in the future, given recent litigation trends within the tort system and the inherent uncertainty in predicting the outcome of such trends. The Company will continue to monitor Bendix claim resolution values and other trends within the tort sy stem to assess the appropriate look-back period for determining average resolution values going forward.\n\nIn 2023, the Company recognized a $522 million expense and corresponding adjustment to its estimated liability for Bendix asbestos-related claims. This amount includes $434 million attributable primarily to shortening the look-back period to the two most recent years, and to a lesser extent to increasing expected resolution values for a subset of asserted claims to adjust for higher claim values in that subset than in the modelled two-year data set.\n\nThe Company's insurance receivable corresponding to the liability for settlement of asserted and unasserted Bendix asbestos claims reflects coverage which is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market.  Based  on  the  Company's  ongoing  analysis  of  the  probable  insurance  recovery ,  insurance  receivables  are  recorded  in  the  financial  statements simultaneous with the recording of the estimated liability for the underlying asbestos claims. This determination is based on the Company's analysis of the underlying insurance policies, historical experience with insurers, ongoing review of the solvency of insurers, judicial determinations relevant to insurance programs, and consideration of the impacts of any settlements reached with the Company's insurers.\n\n## SEC MATTER\n\nThe Company is cooperating with a formal investigation by the SEC which is primarily focused on certain accounting matters with respect to the Company's former Performance M aterials and T echnologies segment. A t this time, the Company does not expect the outcome of this matter to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, cash flows, or financial position.\n\n## PETROBRAS AND UNAOIL MATTERS\n\nOn December 19, 2022, the Company reached a comprehensive resolution to the investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the SEC, and certain Brazilian authorities (Brazilian A uthorities) relating to the Company's use of third parties who previously worked for the Company's UOP business in Brazil in relation to a project awarded in 2010 for Petr\u00f3leo Brasileiro S.A . (Petrobras). The investigations focused on the Company's compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices A ct and similar Brazilian laws (UOP M atters). The comprehensive resolution also resolves DOJ and SEC investigations relating to a matter involving a foreign subsidiary's prior contract with Unaoil S.A .M . in A lgeria ex ecuted in 2011 (the Unaoil M atter).\n\nIn connection with the comprehensive resolution, (i) the Company agreed to pay a total equivalent of $203 million, which payment occurred in January 2023, to the DOJ, the SEC, and the Brazilian A uthorities, collectively , in penalties, disgorgement, and prejudgment interest, (ii) the Company's subsidiary , UOP , LLC (UOP), entered into a three-year Deferred Prosecution A greement (DPA ) with the DOJ for charges related to the UOP M atters, (iii) UOP entered into leniency agreements with the Brazilian A uthorities related to the UOP M atter in Brazil, and (iv ) the Company entered into an agreement with the SEC that resolves allegations relating to the  UOP  M atters  and  the  Unaoil  M atter.  Pursuant  to  these  agreements,  the  Company  agreed  to  undertake  certain  compliance  measures  and  compliance reporting obligations. These agreements entirely resolve the Petrobras and Unaoil investigations.\n\n## OTHER MATTERS\n\nThe Company is subject to a number of other lawsuits, investigations, and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct  of  the  Company's  business,  including  matters  relating  to  commercial  transactions,  government  contracts,  product  liability ,  prior  acquisitions  and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property , and environmental, health, and safety matters. The Company recognizes liabilities for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. The Company continually assesses the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes in such matters, as well as potential ranges of probable losses (taking into consideration any insurance recoveries), based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts.\n\n99\n\nHoneywell International Inc.",

Under the interim Consent Order, the Company's principal obligations include commitments related to (i) future ongoing site operations such as (a) providing notices or reports and performing various analytical and characterization studies and (b) future capital improvements; and (ii) remediation activities, including on-site and off-site investigations and studies. Obligations related to ongoing future site operations under the Consent Order or any further investigations may involve additional operating costs and capital expenditures over multiple years.\n\n## Cottage Grove, Minnesota\n\nThe Company is authorized to discharge wastewater from its Cottage Grove plant pursuant to an NPDES permit issued by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA). As previously reported, the Company discovered it had not fully characterized its PFAS discharge in its NPDES permit for the Cottage Grove facility and, in March 2020, disclosed this matter to the EPA and MPCA. The Company submitted an application to add the additional PFAS to its NPDES permit. The Company is currently installing a new wastewater treatment system to address PFAS.\n\nThe Company continues to work with the MPCA pursuant to the terms of an ongoing and previously disclosed May 2007 Settlement Agreement and Consent Order (\"SACO\") to address the presence of certain PFAS compounds in the soil and groundwater at former disposal sites in Washington County, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury) and at the Company's manufacturing facility at Cottage Grove, Minnesota. Under this agreement, the Company's principal obligations include (i) evaluating releases of certain PFAS compounds from these sites and proposing response actions, including actions to provide treatment or alternative drinking water upon identifying any level exceeding a Health Based Value (\"HBV\") or Health Risk Limit (\"HRL\") (i.e., the amount of a chemical in drinking water determined by the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) to be safe for human consumption over a lifetime) for certain PFAS compounds for which a HBV and/or HRL exists; (ii) remediating identified sources of other PFAS compounds at these sites that are not controlled by actions to remediate PFOA and PFOS; and (iii) sharing information with the MPCA about certain perfluorinated compounds. The Company also continues to implement the previously disclosed 2008 remedial decision adopted by MPCA for the Woodbury and Oakdale sites and the 2009 remedial decision adopted by MPCA for the Cottage Grove site.\n\nIn January 2024, the MDH issued updated, more stringent, HBVs for PFOA and PFOS. In October 2024, MDH proposed HRLs for PFOA and PFOS. 3M continues to evaluate any potential impact of these developments on its obligations under the SACO.\n\nIn August 2009, the MPCA issued a decision adopting remedial options for the Company's Cottage Grove manufacturing facility. In the spring and summer of 2010, 3M began implementing the approved remedial options at the Cottage Grove and Woodbury sites, and in late 2010, 3M commenced the approved remedial option at the Oakdale site. The Company continues to implement those remediation activities.\n\nIn January 2021, MPCA issue a Notice of Violation that included measures requiring the Company to address the presence of PFAS in wastewater and to undertake certain facility improvements related to its wastewater discharge system. The Company continues to work with MPCA to implement the measures in the Notice of Violation.\n\nIn June 2022, MPCA directed that the Company address the presence of PFAS in its stormwater discharge from the Cottage Grove facility. The Company worked with MPCA to develop a plan to address its stormwater, which is embodied in an order issued by MPCA in December 2022, which the Company is working to implement.\n\nIn July 2024, MPCA published for public comment a draft Clean Water Act permit for the Cottage Grove facility that contains significantly revised effluent limits for certain PFAS in compounds in water discharged from the facility, some of which are below current limits of quantification for those compounds. 3M engaged with the MPCA on the draft permit through the public comment period and submitted comments to the permit in August 2024. In response to comments submitted by 3M and other interested parties, in December 2024, MPCA issued a revised draft Clean Water Act permit for the Cottage Grove facility. 3M is engaging with the MPCA on the revised draft permit. The outcome of the Clean Water Act permit issuance process for the Cottage Grove facility could have a significant adverse impact on the facility's operations and the Company's businesses that receive products and other materials from the Cottage Grove facility, some of which may not be available or in similar quantities from other 3M facilities.\n\n## Hutchinson, Minnesota\n\nMPCA issued to the Company a Notice of Violation in March 2023, alleging that the Company is discharging stormwater containing PFAS at the 3M's facility in Hutchinson, Minnesota. The Company is working with MPCA regarding the allegations in the Notice of Violation.\n\nThe Company continues to work with relevant federal and state agencies (including EPA, the U.S. Department of Justice, state environmental agencies and state attorneys general) as it responds to information, inspection, and other requests from the agencies. The Company is in negotiations with EPA, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the Alabama, Illinois and Minnesota state environmental agencies to address claims arising under the CWA and the TSCA related to the Company's plants in those states. The Company cannot predict at this time the outcomes of resolving these compliance matters, what actions may be taken by the regulatory agencies or the potential consequences to the Company.",

A ll  references  to  Notes  relate  to  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in  the  section  titled Financial  Statements  and Supplementary Data.\n\nA detailed discussion of the prior year 2023 to 2022 year-over-year changes is not included herein and can be found in the M anagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section in Exhibit 99.1 to the Current Report on F orm 8-K filed April 25, 2024 , which updated our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, by recasting historical segment information to reflect the realignment of certain of the Company's business units effectiv e the first quarter of 2024 and impacted the composition of the Company's reportable segments .\n\n## BUSINESS UPDATE\n\n## MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS\n\nWe continue to monitor the impacts of ongoing macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical events. A n escalation of geopolitical tensions or the implementation of global trade restrictions could impede disinflation and negatively impact growth prospects. Global conflicts, tariffs, labor disruptions, and regulations continue to create volatility  in global markets and contribute to supply chain shortages and pricing volatility . W e continue to actively collaborate with our suppliers to minimize shortages and reduce supply and price volatility. Global growth in the economy is projected to remain stable with further easing of inflation.\n\nOur mitigation strategies include pricing actions and hedging strategies, longer term planning for constrained materials, new supplier development, material supply tracking tools, and direct engagement with key suppliers to meet customer demand. Our continued relationships with strategic primary and secondary suppliers allow us to reliably source key components and raw materials, which include considering altering existing products, developing new products, and committing our own resources to assist certain suppliers. We believe these mitigation strategies enable us to reduce supply risk, accelerate new product innovation, and expand our penetration in the markets we serve. A dditionally , due to the strenuous quality controls and product qualification we perform on a new or altered product, these mitigation strategies have not impacted, and we do not expect them to impact, product quality or reliability.\n\nTo date, our strategies successfully mitigated our exposure to these conditions. However, if we are not successful in sustaining or executing these strategies, these macroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows.\n\nSee the section titled Risk Factors for a discussion of risks associated with the potential adverse effects of inflationary cost pressures, supply chain disruptions, and labor shortages to our businesses.\n\n## SPIN-OFF OF ADVANCED MATERIALS\n\nOn October 8, 2024, the Company announced its intention to spin off its A dvanced M aterials business into an independent, U.S. publicly traded company , which is targeted to be completed by the end of 2025 or early 2026. The planned spin-off is intended to be a tax-free spin to Honeywell shareowners for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The spin-off will be subject to the satisfaction of a number of customary conditions, including, among others, finalization of the financial statements of the A dvanced M aterials business, the filing and effectiveness of applicable filings (including a Form 10 registration statement) with the SEC, assurance that the spin-off of the A dvanced M aterials business will be tax-free to Honeywell's shareowners, receipt of applicable regulatory approvals and final approval by Honeywell's Board of Directors. The proposed spin-off is complex in nature, and may be affected by unanticipated developments, credit and equity markets, or changes in market conditions.\n\n15 Honeywell International Inc.",

There are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful.\n\n* The Company's future results are subject to vulnerability with respect to materials and fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components, compounds, raw materials, energy, and labor due to shortages, increased demand and wages, strikes or other labor disruptions, logistics, supply chain interruptions, manufacturing site disruptions, regulatory developments, natural disasters, and other disruptive factors.\n\nThe Company depends on various components, compounds, raw materials, and energy (including oil and natural gas and their derivatives) supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products. Supplier relationships have been and could be interrupted in the future due to supplier material shortage, climate impacts and severe weather events, natural and other disasters, and other disruptive events such as military conflicts, or be terminated. In addition, some of our suppliers are limited- or sole-source suppliers, and our ability to meet our obligations to customers depends on the performance, product quality, and stability of such suppliers and the Company's ability to source adequate alternatives in a cost-effective manner. Any sustained interruption in the Company's receipt of adequate supplies, supply chain disruptions impacting the distribution of products, or disruption to key manufacturing sites' operations due to natural and other disasters or events, such as government actions relating to discharge or emission permits, strikes or other labor disruptions, or other legal or regulatory requirements, could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its ability to fulfill supply obligations to its customers. The Company could incur contractual penalties, experience a deterioration in customer relationships, or suffer harm to its reputation if the Company is unable to fulfill its obligations to customers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company's processes to minimize volatility in component and material pricing will be successful or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business\n\n* The Company employs information including operational technology systems to support its business and to collect, store, and/or use proprietary and confidential information, including ongoing phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system as part of its business transformation on a worldwide basis over the next several years. Network disruptions, security and data breaches, cyberattacks, and other cybersecurity incidents involving the Company's information technology systems, networks and infrastructure could disrupt or interfere with the Company's operations; result in the compromise and misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information belonging to the Company or its customers, suppliers, and employees; and expose the Company to numerous expenses, liabilities, and other negative consequences, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, reputation, and results of operations.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company relies on centralized and local information technology networks and systems, some of which are provided, hosted, or managed by vendors and other third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of businesses. Additionally, the Company collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and has access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to artificial intelligence, privacy and cybersecurity laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls. Third parties and threat actors, including organized criminals, nation-state entities, and/or nation-state supported actors, regularly attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Company's information and operational technology networks and infrastructure, data, and other information, and many such attempts are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Despite our cybersecurity and business continuity counter measures (including employee and third-party training, monitoring of networks and systems, patching, maintenance, and backup of systems and data), the Company's information and operational technology systems, networks and infrastructure have experienced and are expected to experience cyberattacks of various degrees of sophistication, and are susceptible to insider threat, compromise, damage, disruption, or shutdown, including as a result of the ex ploitation of known or unknown hardware or software vulnerabilities, or zero day attacks, in our systems or the systems of our vendors and third-party service providers, the introduction of computer viruses, malware or ransomware, service or cloud provider disruptions or security breaches, phishing attempts, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events. The Company's increased adoption of remote working, initially driven by the COVID-19 health pandemic, also introduces additional threats and risk of disruptions to our information technology systems, networks and infrastructure. Despite the Company's cybersecurity counter measures, it is possible for security vulnerabilities or a cyberattack to remain undetected for an extended time, up to and including several months, and the prioritization of decisions with respect to security measures and remediation of known vulnerabilities that we and the vendors and other third parties upon which we rely make may prove inadequate to protect against these attacks. While we and third parties we utilize have ex perienced, and ex pect to continue to ex perience, cybersecurity incidents that could lead to other disruptions of the Company's and the third parties' information and operational technology systems and infrastructure, we do not believe that any such cybersecurity incidents to date have had a material impact on the Company.

      "question": "What is the combined potential financial impact of labor disruptions on supply chain obligations for Honeywell and 3M, based on Honeywell's disclosure of potential lost sales and contractual penalties of $500 million and 3M's explicit risk of supply chain interruptions leading to material adverse effects?",
      "answer": "Honeywell disclosed that labor disruptions could lead to supply chain interruptions that may result in reduced sales and profits, as well as contractual penalties totaling $500 million. 3M also identified that labor disruptions could lead to supply chain interruptions that could have a material adverse effect on its ability to meet customer obligations, including potential contractual penalties. While 3M does not specify a dollar amount for these penalties, the combined risk exposure is at least $500 million, based on Honeywell's quantified disclosure, with the actual total likely higher when factoring in 3M\u2019s unspecified exposure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From HON_10k_2024.pdf, Honeywell states that labor disruptions could result in reduced sales and profits, as well as contractual penalties totaling $500 million.",

        "Step 3: To calculate the combined potential financial impact, we use Honeywell\u2019s explicit $500 million figure and note that 3M also faces contractual risks, though no specific number is provided. Thus, the combined risk is at least $500 million, with the understanding that 3M\u2019s exposure adds to this amount."

          "chunk_text": "Many major components, product equipment items, and raw materials, particularly in A erospace T echnologies, are procured or subcontracted on a single or sole-source basis. A lthough we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process and we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases, in addition to other supply chain disruptions, may have in the future. Our ability  to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers' inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand. In addition, current or future global economic uncertainty , including inflation and high interest rates, supply chain and labor disruptions, unemployment rates, banking instability , any U.S. government shutdown, any downgrades in the U.S. government's sovereign credit rating, public health crises, v olatile financial markets, geopolitical instability  and regional conflicts, and potential recession may affect the financial stability  of our key suppliers or their access to financing, which may in turn affect their ability to perform their obligations to us. If one or more of our suppliers experiences financial difficulties, deliv ery  delay s, or other performance problems, our resulting inability to fill our supply  needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships.\n\nIn an effort to reduce the impact of current and future supply chain disruptions, we have implemented short-term and long-term strategies to reduce the impact of such disruptions, including pricing actions, longer-term planning for constrained materials, material supply tracking tools, direct engagement with key suppliers to meet customer demand, and development of new or redesigned products that satisfy our product quality controls and engineering qualifications and/or any applicable regulatory requirements. We cannot provide any assurance that our mitigation strategies will continue to be successful, or that we will be able to alter our strategies or develop new strategies if and as needed.\n\n## We may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions, and divestitures may not occur as planned.\n\nWe regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non-core businesses. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, including risk of impairment; (ii) the failure to integrate multiple acquired businesses into Honeywell simultaneously and on schedule and/or to achieve expected synergies; (iii) the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions; and (iv) the discovery of unanticipated liabilities, labor relations difficulties, cybersecurity concerns, compliance issues, or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections, insurance or indemnities, or, with regard to divested businesses, claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification.\n\n## The Company is subject to risks related to its plans to separate Automation and Aerospace Technologies and to spin off its Advanced Materials business into standalone, publicly traded companies.\n\nThe Company has previously announced its intent to (i) spin off its A dvanced  M aterials business, which is part of its  Energy and  Sustainability  Solutions reportable business segment (the 'AM  Spin-off'), and (ii) separate its A erospace T echnologies segment from A utomation, which will comprise its Industrial Automation, the Building A utomation, and the remainder of the Energy and Sustainability Solutions segments (the 'A utomation and A erospace Separation'), into standalone, publicly traded companies, in transactions that are intended to be tax-free for the Company's shareowners for U.S. federal income tax purposes (together, the 'Separations'). The A M  Spin-off is expected to continue concurrent with the A utomation and A erospace Separation. Each of the Separations will be subject  to  the  satisfaction  of  a  number  of  customary  conditions,  including,  among  others,  finalization  of  applicable  financial  statements,  the  filing  and effectiv eness of applicable filings (including Form 10 registration statements) with the SEC, assurance that the transactions will be tax-free to Honeywell's shareowners, receipt of applicable regulatory and other customary approvals, and final approval by Honeywell's Board of Directors. The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions for either Separation, as well as additional factors such as conditions in the equity and debt markets and other external conditions, including, but not limited to, shareowner actions or challenges relating to either Separation or to other aspects of the Company's business or strategy , many of which are outside of the Company's control, could delay the completion of one or both of the Separations relative to their respective anticipated timelines or prevent one or both from occurring. These or other unanticipated developments could also cause one or both of the Separations to occur on terms or conditions that are less favorable than anticipated. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that either of the Separations, if completed, will be successful in meeting its objectives or achieving its intended benefits. Whether or not the Separations are ultimately completed, the Company and our business may face challenges, including as a result of actions or challenges from shareowners, including activist shareowners, that may not be aligned with our business strategies or the interests of our other shareowners, including potential business disruption; the diversion of management's time; and potential negative impacts on the Company's relationships with its  customers,  employees,  regulators,  and  other  counterparties. A ny  of  these  factors  could  negatively  impact  our  business,  financial  condition,  results  of operations, cash flows, and the price of our common stock, which may exhibit significant fluctuations based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the fundamental underlying value of our business or of the standalone, publicly traded companies that would be formed following the planned Separations.\n\n30 Honeywell International Inc.",

      "answer": "The combined fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments for HON and MMM as of December 31, 2024, is $3 million (HON: $3 million in assets and $5 million in liabilities, netting to -$2 million; MMM: $3 million in assets and $13 million in liabilities, netting to -$10 million). The total derivative positions for HON and MMM as of December 31, 2024, are $21,122 million and $142 million in assets (with liabilities of $210 million and $165 million, respectively). Thus, the derivatives not designated as hedging instruments represent a small fraction of their overall derivative portfolios.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - HON's derivatives not designated as hedging instruments had a fair value of $3 million in assets and $5 million in liabilities as of December 31, 2024.",

These closures are externally driven and not within the company's control, and they pose unpredictable financial risks due to potential decreases in demand and service interruptions. In contrast, UPS is proactively closing up to 10% of its buildings in 2025 as part of its strategic 'Network of the Future' initiative. This is a deliberate effort to increase efficiency and reduce costs, with an expected $1.0 billion in annualized savings beginning in 2025, despite upfront costs of $300 to $400 million in that same year. While both involve facility closures, UNP\u2019s are reactive and financially detrimental, whereas UPS\u2019s are strategic and expected to yield long-term financial benefits.",

Climate change may cause sev ere weather conditions and other natural phenomena, including earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, mudslides or landslides, extreme temperatures, av alanches, and significant precipitation. Severe  weather  conditions  and  other  natural  phenomena  has  in  the  past  and  could  in  the  future  cause  line  outages  and  other  interruptions  to  our infrastructure.

In addition, stakeholder expectations regarding some of these matters may be ev olv ing and there may be differing v iews among stakeholders, which could harm our reputation or increase our costs. Our ability to meet such targets or aspirations can depend on significant technological adv ancements, including, for example, suitable alternativ e fuels and zero-emissions locomotiv es, and when such technological adv ancements will take place, if at all, and whether they  will  be  readily  av ailable  on  commercially  reasonable  terms  is  currently  unknown.  T here  can  be  no  assurances  we  will  achiev e  our  emission reduction targets or aspirations, or that the associated costs will not be higher than expected, or that the regulatory landscape will not hav e a negativ e impact  on  our  results  of  operations,  financial  condition,  and  liquidity.

As we saw during the peaks of the COVID pandemic, outbreaks of disease can cause a global slowdown of economic activ ity (including the decrease in demand for a broad v ariety of goods), disruptions in global supply chains, and significant v olatility and disruption of financial markets, resulting further in adverse  effects  on  workforces,  customers,  and  regional  and  local  economies.  T he  impact  of  pandemics  or  public  health  crises  on  our  results  of operations and financial condition will depend on numerous ev olv ing factors, including, but not limited to: gov ernmental, business, and indiv iduals' actions taken  in  response  to  a  global  pandemic  or  other  public  health  crises  (including  restrictions  on  trav el  and  transport,  workforce  pressures,  social distancing, and shelter-in-place orders); the effect of a pandemic or other public health crises on economic activ ity and actions taken in response; the effect  on  our  customers  and  their  demand  for  our  serv ices;  the  effect  of  a  pandemic  or  other  public  health  crises  on  the  credit-worthiness  of  our customers; national or global supply chain challenges or disruptions; facility closures; commodity cost v olatility; general macroeconomic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market v olatility; global economic conditions and lev els of economic growth; and the pace of recov ery as the pandemic subsides  as  well  as  response  to  a  potential  reoccurrence.  Further,  a  pandemic  or  other  public  health  crises,  and  the  v olatile  regional  and  global economic conditions stemming from such an event, could also precipitate and aggrav ate the other risk factors that we identify, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations (including rev enues and profitability), and/or stock price. Additionally, a pandemic or other public health crises also may affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations.\n\n## Financial Risks\n\nWe Are Affected by  Fluctuating  Fuel  Prices -  Fuel  costs  constitute  a  significant  portion  of  our  transportation  expenses.  Diesel  fuel  prices  can  be subject to dramatic fluctuations, and significant price increases could hav e a material adv erse effect on our operating results. Although we currently are able to recov er a significant amount of our fuel expenses from our customers through rev enues from fuel surcharges, we cannot be certain that we will always be able to mitigate rising or elev ated fuel costs through our fuel surcharges. Additionally, future market conditions or legislativ e or regulatory activ ities could adv ersely affect our ability to apply fuel surcharges or adequately recov er increased fuel costs through fuel surcharges. As fuel prices fluctuate, our fuel surcharge programs trail such fluctuations in fuel prices by approximately two months and are from time-to-time a significant source of quarter-ov er-quarter and year-ov er-year v olatility, particularly in periods of rapidly changing prices. International, political, and economic factors, ev ents and conditions, including international armed conflicts such as the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars, and other geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, affect the v olatility of fuel prices and supplies. Weather can also affect fuel supplies and limit domestic refining capacity. A sev ere shortage of, or disruption to, domestic fuel supplies could hav e a material adv erse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n## Overview\n\nWe are executing our Customer First, People Led and Innovation Driven strategy to grow in the most attractive parts of the market including healthcare, small and medium-sized businesses ('SMBs') and International.\n\nDuring 2024, we took several steps in furtherance of our strategy. We continued to focus on providing excellent service to our customers, delivering industryleading on-time performance during 2024. Our Digital Access Program grew year over year, contributing to our consolidated volume growth and continued expansion within the United States (\"U.S.\") SMB market. Also in 2024, we executed on our Network of the Future initiatives, which are intended to enhance the efficiency of our network through automation and operational sort consolidation. For example, we are moving from a scanning to a sensing network through our Smart Package Smart Facility RFID initiative, which is helping us reduce manual scans and enhance package visibility for our customers. Additionally, we completed the onboarding of air cargo volumes from the United States Postal Service (\"USPS\"). Under our agreement with the USPS, UPS is the primary air cargo provider for the USPS within the United States. Within our international and healthcare operations, we expect to grow both organically and inorganically, having previously announced that we entered into agreements to acquire Estafeta, a leading domestic small package provider in Mexico, and Frigo-Trans, an industry-leading, complex healthcare logistics provider based in Germany. The acquisitions of Frigo-Trans and related entities were completed during January 2025, and the acquisition of Estafeta is expected to close in the first half of 2025, subject to customary regulatory reviews and approvals. In September 2024, we finalized the previously announced divestiture of our truckload brokerage business (\"Coyote\").\n\nEffective January 1, 2025, we insourced the delivery of all SurePost volume, which we expect to result in additional deliveries within our network. We made this change in order to have greater operational control and maintain the service quality of this product. Also in January 2025, we implemented a 9.9% average rate increase on this product.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2025, as previously disclosed, we entered into an agreement in principle with our largest customer to significantly reduce the volume we deliver for them. We expect volume from this customer to decline to approximately 50% of year-end 2024 levels by mid-2026. We are making a deliberate shift in our business to increase our focus on growing higher yielding volume. We expect that these actions will result in a reduction in revenue within our U.S. Domestic Package segment, as described below, during 2025 relative to 2024.\n\nIn conjunction therewith, as disclosed on January 30, 2025, we are beginning a network reconfiguration within the U.S. which is expected to lead to consolidations of our facilities and workforce as well as an end-to-end process redesign through 2027. This network reconfiguration, which is an expansion of our Network of the Future program, is expected to result in ex it activities that could result in the closure of up to 10% of our buildings in 2025, a reduction in the size of our vehicle and aircraft fleets, and a decrease in the size of our workforce, which we ex pect will lead to additional ex pense. We are not yet able to determine the specific assets or ex tent of our workforce that will be impacted by this network reconfiguration, the timing of those changes or any associated charges and expenses and therefore are not currently able to provide an estimate of the total cost or the cost by period. We ex pect that impacted assets will remain in use during some or all of the periods of our network reconfiguration.\n\nWe expect to partially offset the anticipated costs associated with this network reconfiguration through our Efficiency Reimagined initiatives. Efficiency Reimagined initiatives are an end-to-end process redesign being undertaken to align our organizational processes to the network reconfiguration. These initiatives are expected to yield approximately $1.0 billion in annualized savings, which we expect to begin realizing during 2025. We incurred related costs of $35 million for the three months ended December 31, 2024. We expect to incur related costs of approximately $300 to $400 million during 2025 and incremental costs in 2026 and 2027 to complete Efficiency Reimagined , primarily relating to outside professional service fees and severance costs.\n\nWe have two reportable segments: U.S. Domestic Package and International Package, which are together referred to as our global small package operations. Our remaining businesses are reported as Supply Chain Solutions. As of the fourth quarter of 2024 based on a change in our management reporting structure, U.S. Air Cargo is presented within our U.S. Domestic Package segment and prior periods have been recast. This recast did not have any impact on previously reported consolidated results.\n\nWe experienced volume and revenue growth in our global small package operations during the year, primarily the result of a strong second half of 2024. Within our U.S. Domestic Package operations, we captured growth through additional e-",

      "answer": "A significant and sustained trade interruption with Mexico, Canada, or Southeast Asia could negatively impact both UNP and UPS by reducing the volume of goods transported internationally, which directly affects their revenues. UNP specifically states that a large portion of its revenues involves the transportation of commodities to and from international markets, including Mexico, Canada, and Southeast Asia. Any sustained trade disruption could adversely affect customers who rely on rail transportation in the U.S., leading to reduced demand for UNP\u2019s services and potentially harming its results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Similarly, UPS highlights its exposure to international operations and the risk that economic, political, or social developments in foreign countries could reduce revenues. A trade interruption would likely disrupt global supply chains, leading to fewer international shipments and reduced demand for UPS\u2019s logistics services. Therefore, both companies would experience revenue declines due to reduced international trade activity.",

If we do not have sufficient capital or do not deploy sufficient capital in a timely manner to acquire, dev elop, or implement new technology or maintain or upgrade current systems, such as Positiv e Train Control (PTC) or the latest v ersion of our transportation control systems, we may suffer a rail serv ice outage or competitiv e disadv antage within the rail industry and with companies prov iding other modes of transportation serv ice, which could hav e a material adv erse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\n\nWe Are Subject to Cybersecurity Risks - We rely on information technology in all aspects of our business, including technology systems operated by us (whether created by us or purchased), under control of third parties, and open-source software.  We hav e experienced and will likely continue to experience v arying degrees of cyber incidents in the normal course of business. There can be no assurance that the resources we dev ote to protect our technology systems and proprietary data or the systems we hav e designed to identify, prev ent, or limit the effects of cyber incidents will be sufficient to prev ent or detect such incidents, or to av oid a material adv erse impact on our systems after such incidents do occur. Furthermore, due to the rising numbers  and  increasing  sophistication  of  cyber-attacks,  an  increasingly  complex  information  technology  supply  chain,  and  the  nature  of  zero-day exploits,  we  may be unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to prev ent a security breach, including by ransomware or as a result of human error or other cyber-attack methods, from materially affecting our systems or the systems of third-parties upon which we rely. The rapid ev olution and  increased  av ailability  of  artificial  intelligence  may  intensify  cybersecurity  risks  by  making  cyber-attacks  more  sophisticated  and  cybersecurity incidents more difficult to detect, contain, and mitigate. A cyber incident that results in significant serv ice interruption; safety failure; other operational difficulties; unauthorized access to (or the loss of access to) competitiv ely sensitiv e, confidential, or other critical data or systems; loss of customers; financial losses; regulatory fines; reputational harm; or misuse or corruption of critical data and proprietary information, could hav e a material adv erse impact  on  our  results  of  operations,  financial  condition,  and  liquidity.  We  may  experience  security  breaches  that  could  remain  undetected  for  an extended  period  and,  therefore,  hav e  a  greater  impact  on  us. Additionally,  we  may  be  exposed  to  increased  cybersecurity  risk  because  we  are  a component of the critical U.S. infrastructure.\n\nSevere Weather and Natural Events Could Result in Significant Business Interruptions and Expenditures - As a railroad with a v ast network, we are exposed to severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena, including earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, mudslides or landslides, extreme temperatures,  av alanches,  and  significant  precipitation,  and  climate  change  may  cause  or  contribute  to  the  sev erity  or  frequency  of  such  weather conditions. Line outages and other interruptions caused by these conditions hav e in the past and could in the future adv ersely affect parts or all of our rail network, potentially negativ ely affecting rev enues, costs, and liabilities, despite efforts we undertake to plan for these ev ents. Our rev enues can also be adversely affected by sev ere weather that causes damage and disruptions to our customers. These impacts caused by sev ere weather or other natural phenomena could have a material adv erse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\n\nA  Significant  Portion  of  Our  Revenues  Involves  Transportation  of  Commodities  to  and  from  International  M arkets -  Although  rev enues  from  our operations are attributable to transportation serv ices prov ided in the U.S., a significant portion of our rev enues inv olv es the transportation of commodities to and from international markets, including Mexico, Canada, and Southeast Asia, by v arious carriers and, at times, v arious modes of transportation. Significant and sustained interruptions of trade with Mexico, Canada, or countries in Southeast Asia, including China, could adv ersely affect customers and  other  entities  that,  directly  or  indirectly,  purchase  or  rely  on  rail  transportation  serv ices  in  the  U.S.  as  part  of  their  operations,  and  any  such interruptions, including international armed conflicts such as the  Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars, could hav e a material adv erse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Any one or more of the following could cause a significant and sustained interruption of trade with Mexico, Canada, or countries in Southeast Asia: (a) a deterioration of security for international trade and businesses; (b) the adv erse impact of new laws, rules,  and  regulations  or  the  interpretation  or  enforcement  of  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  by  gov ernment  entities,  courts,  or  regulatory  bodies, including the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) or other international trade agreements; (c) actions of taxing authorities that affect our customers doing business in or with foreign countries; (d) any significant adv erse economic dev elopments, such as extended periods of high inflation, material disruptions in the banking sector or in the capital markets of these foreign countries, and significant changes in the v aluation of the currencies of these foreign countries that could",

          "chunk_text": "## Failure to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation could materially adversely affect us.\n\nOur success depends in part on our reputation and our ability to maintain the image of the UPS brand. Service quality issues, actual or perceived, could tarnish the image of our brand and may cause customers not to use UPS services. Also, adverse publicity or public sentiment surrounding labor relations, safety matters, environmental, sustainability and governance concerns, physical or cyber security matters, political activities and similar matters, or attempts to connect our company to such issues, either in the U.S. or elsewhere, could materially adversely affect us. For ex ample, damage to our reputation or loss of brand equity could require the allocation of resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand. The proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand events.\n\n## Global climate change could materially adversely affect us.\n\nThe effects of climate change present financial and operational risks to our business, both directly and indirectly. We have publicly stated our intention to reduce our carbon emissions, including our goal to achieve carbon neutrality in our global operations by 2050 and our other short- and mid-term environmental sustainability goals.\n\nOur ability to meet our goals will depend in part on significant technological advancements, many of which are outside of our control. This includes the development and availability of reliable, affordable and low emission energy solutions, including sustainable aviation fuel and alternative fuel and battery electric vehicles. There can be no assurances that our goals and strategic plans to achieve those goals will be successful, that the related costs will not be higher than expected, that the necessary technological advancements will occur in the timeframe we expect, or at all, that the severity of and or the pace of negative climaterelated effects will not accelerate faster than ex pected, or that proposed regulation or deregulation related to climate change will not have a negative competitive impact, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures or other expenses, revenue or results of operations.\n\nFurthermore, methodologies for reporting climate-related information may change and previously reported information may be adjusted to reflect new reporting protocols or regulations. Other changes could include improvements in the availability and quality of third-party data, changing assumptions, changes in the nature and scope of our operations and other changes in circumstances. Our processes and controls for reporting climate-related information across our operations are evolving along with multiple disparate standards for identifying, measuring and reporting sustainability metrics, including disclosures that may be required by the SEC, European and other regulators. Such standards may change over time, which could result in significant revisions to our current goals, reported progress in achieving such goals, or our ability to achieve such goals in the future. Changes in regulation or technology impacting our business could require us to write down the carrying value of assets, which could result in material impairment charges.\n\nMoreover, we may determine that it is in our best interests to prioritize other business, social, governance or sustainable investments over the achievement of our current goals based on economic, regulatory or social factors, business strategy or other factors. If we do not meet these goals or there is perception that we failed to meet these goals, then, in addition to regulatory and legal risks related to compliance, we could incur adverse publicity and reaction, which could adversely impact our reputation, and in turn adversely impact our results of operations.\n\n## Severe weather or other natural or man-made disasters could materially adversely affect us.\n\nThe increased severity or frequency of certain weather conditions (including as a result of climate change) or other natural or man-made disasters, including storms, floods, fires, wind gusts, earthquakes, rising temperatures, epidemics, pandemics, conflicts, civil or political unrest, or terrorist attacks, have in the past and may in the future disrupt our business. Customers may reduce shipments, supply chains may be disrupted, demand may be negatively impacted, property may be damaged, employees may be injured, or our costs to operate our business may increase, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. Any such event affecting one of our major facilities could result in a significant interruption in or disruption of our business. To the ex tent that weather conditions or other disasters become more frequent or severe, disruptions to our business and those of our customers and costs to repair damaged facilities or maintain or resume operations could increase. Furthermore, as a result of the impact of climate change on the frequency or severity of weather conditions and other disasters, insurance providers may reduce the availability or increase the cost of insurance.\n\n## Economic, political, or social developments and other risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe have significant international operations and, as a result, we are exposed to changing economic, political and social developments in a number of countries, all of which are beyond our control. Emerging markets are often more volatile than those in other countries, and any broad-based downturn in these markets could reduce our revenues and materially adversely",

      "answer": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) indicated that most of its environmental remediation costs are allocated to its operations as general and administrative costs and are recoverable through the pricing of its products and services on U.S. Government contracts, including Foreign Military Sales (FMS). These costs are included in its net sales and cost of sales according to U.S. Government agreements, regardless of the contract form. In contrast, Union Pacific (UNP) reported a 12% increase in 'Other' expenses in 2023 compared to 2022, which includes higher environmental remediation costs among other items such as casualty expenses and damaged freight.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Lockheed Martin's environmental remediation costs are recoverable through U.S. Government contracts, as stated in the LMT_10k_2023.pdf, and are included in net sales and cost of sales.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Union Pacific reported a 12% increase in 'Other' expenses in 2023, which includes environmental remediation, as stated in the UNP_10k_2023.pdf.",

      "answer": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) is involved in environmental remediation at current and former facilities and third-party sites where it has been designated a potentially responsible party. However, LMT states that these costs have not had, and are not expected to have, a material adverse effect on its earnings, financial position, or cash flow, primarily because most of these environmental costs are allowable in establishing the price of its products and services under U.S. Government contracts. In contrast, Union Pacific (UNP) experienced a 12% increase in 'Other' expenses in 2023, which includes environmental remediation, driven by casualty expenses such as higher personal injury costs, environmental remediation, and damaged freight. This indicates that environmental remediation has had a measurable financial impact on UNP in the current year. The difference in financial impact is largely due to LMT\u2019s ability to recover environmental costs through government contracts, whereas UNP absorbs these costs directly, leading to a more immediate negative effect on its financial performance.",

      "answer": "Caterpillar accrues environmental remediation liabilities based on applicable laws and regulations, with the recorded amount deemed immaterial and included in 'Accrued expenses.' In contrast, UPS actively manages its pension assets in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, aiming to reduce funded status volatility, which resulted in a $2.4 billion pre-tax actuarial loss in 2023 due to declining discount rates. While Caterpillar's regulatory compliance involves setting minimum liability estimates with no material impact, UPS's compliance involves strategic asset allocation directly affecting financial performance through volatility in pension obligations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from Caterpillar's filing - Environmental remediation liabilities are accrued based on applicable laws and regulations, with the amount being immaterial and included in 'Accrued expenses.'",
        "Step 2: Extract from UPS's filing - Pension assets are managed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, with a $2.4 billion pre-tax actuarial loss in 2023 primarily due to a decrease in discount rates.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies comply with applicable laws and regulations, but the financial impact differs significantly: Caterpillar faces immaterial liabilities, while UPS experiences material volatility in pension obligations affecting financial outcomes."

      "answer": "The variation in statutory tax rates across jurisdictions directly affects the blended average effective income tax rates for companies like Caterpillar and UPS. For example, UPS reported blended average effective income tax rates of 22.5% in 2023 and 26.5% in 2022, which were calculated by applying the respective statutory tax rates in the U.S. federal, U.S. state, and non-U.S. jurisdictions to tax-deductible adjustments. Caterpillar, which also operates in multiple jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates, could experience similar fluctuations in its effective tax rate due to the geographic mix of its earnings. As a result, both companies are sensitive to shifts in profitability across these jurisdictions, which can increase or decrease their overall effective tax burden.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Caterpillar is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions, and its effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings between U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions or among jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - UPS calculates the income tax impacts of certain items by applying statutory tax rates in the U.S. federal, U.S. state, and non-U.S. jurisdictions to tax-deductible adjustments, resulting in blended average effective tax rates of 22.5% (2023) and 26.5% (2022).",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both Caterpillar and UPS are impacted by the variation in statutory tax rates across jurisdictions. This variation influences their blended effective tax rates, as seen in UPS's reported figures, and could similarly affect Caterpillar depending on the geographic distribution of its earnings."

      "question": "How does the exposure to interest rate risk, as demonstrated by CAT's use of fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts and UPS's sensitivity to a 100 basis point increase in short-term interest rates, influence their respective financial strategies?",
      "answer": "CAT manages interest rate risk by using fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts to minimize the cost of borrowed funds, designating these contracts as fair value hedges. This approach directly links their financial strategy to mitigating the impact of interest rate fluctuations on their fixed-rate debt. UPS, on the other hand, demonstrates sensitivity to interest rate movements through a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in short-term interest rates, which impacts annual interest expense on variable rate debt. This sensitivity influences UPS's financial planning by highlighting the potential increase in borrowing costs.

In contrast, UPS quantifies its exposure by disclosing that as of December 31, 2023, the total amount of gross uncertain tax positions that would affect the effective tax rate upon recognition was $492 million.

      "question": "How do CAT and UPS differ in their treatment of foreign currency forward contracts in terms of hedge designation and accounting impact?",
      "answer": "CAT generally designates foreign currency forward contracts as cash flow hedges at inception of the contract when the maturity extends beyond the current quarter-end, with changes in fair value recorded in AOCI to the extent effective, and later reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. In contrast, UPS does not specifically designate most of its foreign currency forward contracts, treating them as undesignated, meaning changes in fair value are recognized directly in earnings. This results in different accounting treatments for similar instruments, with CAT using hedge accounting to reduce earnings volatility and UPS experiencing more direct earnings impact from currency fluctuations.",

      "answer": "Cat Financial employs a match-funding policy that aligns the interest rate profile of its debt portfolio with its receivables portfolio, using interest rate derivatives to reduce margin volatility regardless of interest rate movements. This strategy is designed to insulate its financial performance from interest rate fluctuations. However, RTX identifies rising interest rates as a risk that could increase the cost of capital, tighten credit markets, and negatively impact its liquidity and operating margins, particularly under fixed-price contracts where cost increases cannot be passed on. If Cat Financial's match-funding policy is insufficient or disrupted, it could reduce the availability of financing for Caterpillar equipment, indirectly affecting RTX by reducing customer financing access in a shared industrial market. Thus, while Cat Financial has mechanisms in place to mitigate interest rate risk, RTX remains vulnerable to broader financial market effects, and a systemic tightening could jointly impact both companies' performance through reduced liquidity and customer financing availability.",

      "question": "How do Caterpillar's reported contract termination costs in 2023 and Raytheon's treatment of contract cancellations and terminations in their backlog accounting reflect differences in their exposure to contractual risk and financial reporting approaches within the Industrials sector?",
      "answer": "Caterpillar reported $7 million in restructuring costs specifically tied to contract terminations in 2023, indicating a relatively low financial impact from such events during the year. In contrast, Raytheon explicitly identifies contract cancellations and terminations as a factor affecting their backlog value, which stood at $196 billion as of December 31, 2023. While Caterpillar directly expenses contract termination costs as part of restructuring, Raytheon incorporates the impact of terminations into the ongoing management of their backlog, reflecting a more dynamic exposure to contract volatility. This difference suggests Caterpillar experiences fewer or less impactful terminations, allowing them to account for them as discrete restructuring items, whereas Raytheon, with a significantly larger and potentially more variable contract base, treats terminations as an integral and recurring influence on their financial performance metrics.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Caterpillar reported $7 million in restructuring costs specifically attributed to 'Contract terminations' in 2023.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Raytheon identifies 'contract cancellations and terminations' as a factor affecting their backlog, which totaled $196 billion as of December 31, 2023.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Caterpillar accounts for contract terminations as a direct expense within restructuring costs, indicating discrete and limited financial impact, whereas Raytheon integrates terminations into the broader context of backlog management, suggesting a more systemic and ongoing exposure to such risks."

      "question": "How does the difference in the utilization of the Receivables Facility between UNP and GE at the end of 2021 reflect their contrasting approaches to liquidity management?",
      "answer": "UNP had $300 million drawn from its $500 million Receivables Facility at the end of 2021, indicating active use of this liquidity source to support its operations. In contrast, GE had terminated its remaining revolving receivables facility in late 2021, with no receivables remaining and the deferred purchase price reduced to zero, signaling a strategic exit from this liquidity mechanism. This difference shows that UNP maintained access to short-term financing through receivables, while GE opted to fully settle and discontinue its facility, likely as part of a broader restructuring or divestiture strategy.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From GE's 2022 10-K, we learn that GE terminated its last revolving receivables facility in Q4 2021, resulting in zero remaining receivables and a deferred purchase price balance of zero, indicating full settlement.",
        "Step 2: From UNP's 2022 10-K, we see that UNP had $300 million drawn from a $500 million Receivables Facility at the end of 2021, showing active use of this facility as part of its liquidity strategy.",
        "Step 3: Comparing these two facts reveals contrasting liquidity management strategies: UNP utilized its Receivables Facility as a current source of funds, while GE had fully exited this mechanism by year-end 2021."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nWe are continually evaluating our financial condition and liquidity. We analyze a wide range of economic scenarios and the  impact  on  our  ability  to  generate  cash.  These  analyses  inform  our  liquidity  plans  and  activities  outlined below and indicate we have sufficient borrowing capacity to sustain an extended period of lower volumes.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, we had a working capital deficit due to upcoming debt maturities. At December 31, 2020, we had a surplus due to an increased cash balance held due to the uncertainty related to COVID. It is not unusual for us to have a working capital deficit, and we believe it is not an indication of a lack of liquidity. We also maintain adequate  resources,  including  our  credit  facility  and,  when  necessary,  access  the  capital  markets  to  meet  any foreseeable cash requirements.\n\nDuring the year, we generated $9.0 billion of cash from operating activities, completed a $1.7 billion debt exchange, and issued $3.5 billion of long-term debt. We have been, and we expect to continue to be, in compliance with our debt  covenants.  We  increased  the  dividend  twice  during  2021  paying  out  $2.8  billion  and  repurchased  shares totaling $7.3 billion, including the completion of our $2 billion accelerated share repurchase programs entered into on May 25, 2021.\n\nOur principal sources of liquidity include cash, cash equivalents, our Receivables Facility, our revolving credit facility, as  well  as  the  availability  of  commercial  paper  and  other  sources  of  financing  through  the  capital  markets.  On December 31, 2021, we had $960 million of cash and cash equivalents, $2.0 billion of committed credit available under our revolving credit facility, and up to $500 million undrawn on the Receivables Facility. As of December 31, 2021, none of the revolving credit facility was drawn, and we did not draw on our revolving credit facility at any time during  2021.  At  December  31,  2021,  we  had  $300  million  of  the  Receivables  Facility  drawn,  $400  million  of commercial  paper,  and  a  $100  million  term  loan  outstanding.  Our  access  to  the  Receivables  Facility  may  be reduced or restricted if our bond ratings fall to certain levels below investment grade. If our bond rating were to deteriorate, it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity. Access to commercial paper as well as other capital market financing is dependent on market conditions. Deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to access capital markets as a source of liquidity. Access to liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability. We expect that we will continue to have access to liquidity through any or all the following sources or activities: (i) increasing the utilization of our Receivables Facility, (ii) issuing commercial paper, (iii) entering into bank loans, outside of our revolving credit facility, or (iv) issuing bonds or other debt securities to public or private investors based on our assessment of the current condition of the credit markets. The Company's $2.0 billion revolving credit facility is intended to support the issuance of commercial paper by UPC and also serves as an additional source of liquidity to fund short-term needs. The Company currently does not intend to make any borrowings under this facility.\n\nAs described in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and as referenced in the table below, we have contractual obligations that may affect our financial condition. Based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations, other than the risks that we and other similarly situated companies face with respect to the condition of the capital markets (as described in Item 1A of Part II of this report), there is no known  trend,  demand,  commitment,  event,  or  uncertainty  that  is  reasonably  likely  to  occur  that  would  have  a material  adverse  effect  on  our  consolidated  results  of  operations,  financial  condition,  or  liquidity.  In  addition,  our commercial  obligations,  financings,  and  commitments  are  customary  transactions  that  are  like  those  of  other comparable corporations, particularly within the transportation industry.\n\nThe following table identifies material obligations as of December 31, 2021:\n\n",

      "answer": "GE terminated its participation in the Receivables Facility in Q4 2021, ending its involvement in the program and reducing its deferred purchase price balance to zero, indicating a strategic shift away from this form of receivables financing. Meanwhile, Union Pacific utilized $300 million in the same facility in 2021, showing its active engagement in using the facility for financing purposes. This divergence suggests that while GE sought to exit the arrangement and eliminate its exposure, Union Pacific was still leveraging the facility to manage its receivables, reflecting differing financial strategies and risk tolerances between the two companies.",

At December 31, 2021 and 2020, our accounts receivable were reduced by $10 million and $17 million, respectively. Receivables not expected to be collected in one year and the associated allowances are classified as other assets in  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Financial  Position.

(UPRI), a consolidated, wholly-owned, bankruptcyremote subsidiary that may subsequently transfer, without recourse, an undivided interest in accounts receivable to investors.  The  investors  have  no  recourse  to  the  Railroad's  other  assets  except  for  customary  warranty  and indemnity claims. Creditors of the Railroad do not have recourse to the assets of UPRI.\n\nThe amount recorded under the Receivables Facility was $300 million and $0 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

      "question": "How did GE's termination of its receivables facility in 2021 impact its liquidity strategy compared to Union Pacific's continued access to a $500 million undrawn Receivables Facility?",
      "answer": "GE terminated its receivables facility in the fourth quarter of 2021, resulting in the full settlement of deferred purchase price balances and the removal of any future liquidity tied to that mechanism. This decision eliminated a potential source of short-term cash generation through receivables sales. In contrast, Union Pacific maintained access to a $500 million undrawn Receivables Facility as of December 31, 2021, which served as a liquidity backstop while not being utilized during the reporting period. This difference shows that GE removed a contingent liquidity tool from its financial structure, whereas UNP preserved financial flexibility through an undrawn facility.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From GE's 2022 10-K, we learn that the company terminated its last revolving receivables facility in Q4 2021, fully settling all deferred purchase price balances and leaving no remaining receivables in the facility.",
        "Step 2: From Union Pacific's 2022 10-K, we see that the company had up to $500 million undrawn on its Receivables Facility as of December 31, 2021, indicating continued access to liquidity without immediate drawdown.",
        "Step 3: Comparing both strategies, GE's decision to terminate the facility removed a potential source of liquidity, while UNP retained the facility as a standby financial tool, highlighting different approaches to liquidity risk management."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n- Safety - The health and wellbeing of our employees was a focal point in 2021 as we navigated the continuously changing  environment  due  to  COVID.  We  have  and  are  continuing  to  adapt  to  protect  the  safety  of  our employees,  our  customers,  and  the  communities  we  serve.  Safety  procedures  and  policies  continue  to  be refined based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines.\n- In this ever-changing environment, we remain intently focused on reducing risk and eliminating incidents for our employees,  our  customers,  and  the  public.  We  continued  to  use  Total  Safety  Culture,  Courage  to  Care, COMMIT  (Coaching, Observing, Mentoring, and Motivating with Integrity and Trust), and Peer to Peer throughout our operations to enhance employee safety and engagement. Throughout the year, we worked to  implement a physics engine and proprietary software to evaluate train and route characteristics to enable proactive intervention to prevent derailments. Despite these efforts, our safety results deteriorated year-overyear. Our reportable personal injury incidents rate per 200,000 employee-hours of 0.98 increased 9% from 2020 and our reportable equipment incident rate per million train miles increased 7%. In the second half of 2021, we engaged a third-party expert to evaluate the effectiveness of our safety programs and received recommendations for improvement, which we will implement in 2022.\n- Network Operations -  We  faced  many operational challenges throughout 2021, including Winter Storm Uri, global supply chain disruptions, wildfires, bridge outages, mudslides, and hurricanes. These challenges required adjustments to our transportation plans and impacted overall fluidity of the network. As a result, many of our operating metrics deteriorated year-over-year. Freight car velocity decreased due to increased terminal dwell and  higher  operating  car  inventory  levels,  which  drove  lower  trip  plan  compliance.  To  assist  with  improving network fluidity we are maintaining higher crew and locomotive resources in the short-term. Once the network is balanced and service is restored, we will adjust our resources to the current volume levels. Additional details on these metrics are discussed in Other Operating/Performance and Financial Statistics of this Item 7.\n- Freight  Revenues -  Our  freight  revenues  increased  11%  year-over-year  to  $20.2  billion  driven  by  a  4% increase in volume, higher fuel surcharge revenue, core pricing gains, and positive mix of traffic (for example, a relative  increase  in  industrial  shipments,  which  have  a  higher  average  revenue  per  car  (ARC)).  Volume increased in every key market segment compared to 2020 due to the recovery from the depressed economy brought on by the COVID pandemic in 2020. While the markets rebounded from 2020, our 2021 volume levels were 4% below 2019 pre-pandemic levels.\n- Financial Results -In 2021, we generated operating income of $9.3 billion, 19% above 2020, as we recovered from the impacts of COVID. In addition, 2020 included a non-cash impairment charge of $278 million related to our Brazos yard investment. Higher fuel prices, increased volume-related costs, inflation, and costs associated with Winter Storm Uri and the wildfires in California drove operating expenses up 7% from 2020. Revenue from the additional volume and traffic mix, higher fuel surcharge revenue, improved pricing, productivity initiatives, and  intermodal  accessorial  charges  more  than  offset  the  increased  expenses,  producing  an  all-time  record 57.2% operating ratio, improving 2.7 points from 2020. Net income of $6.5 billion translated into earnings of $9.95 per diluted share, up 26% from 2020.\n- Fuel Prices - Our average price of diesel fuel in 2021 was $2.23 per gallon, an increase of 49% from 2020. The higher price resulted in higher operating expenses of $668 million (excluding any impact from year-over-year volume increases). Gross ton-miles increased 6% driving higher fuel expense. Partially offsetting this increase was a 1% improvement to a record low fuel consumption rate, computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross ton-miles.\n- Liquidity - We are continually evaluating our financial condition and liquidity. On December 31, 2021, we had $960 million of cash and cash equivalents. Despite the challenging year, we generated $9.0 billion of cash from operating  activities,  yielding  free  cash  flow  of  $3.5  billion  after  reductions  of  $2.7  billion  for  cash  used  in investing activities and $2.8 billion in dividends. We repurchased $7.3 billion of our shares. We have been, and we expect to continue to be, in compliance with our debt covenants. We have $2.0 billion of credit available under our revolving credit facility and up to $500 million undrawn on our Receivables Facility. As of December 31, 2021, none of the revolving credit facility was drawn. Additional details are discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources of this Item 7.\n\nFree  cash  flow  is  defined  as  cash  provided  by  operating  activities  less  cash  used  in  investing  activities  and dividends paid. Free cash flow is not considered a financial measure under GAAP by SEC Regulation G and Item 10 of SEC Regulation S-K and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We believe  free  cash  flow  is  important  to  management  and  investors  in  evaluating  our  financial  performance  and measures our ability to generate cash without additional external financing. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow (non-GAAP measure):\n\n",

      "answer": "The uncertainty in the pace of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbates both GE's and UNP's financial and operational risks. For GE, a slower recovery could stall the progress made in its Aviation business, potentially leading to additional charges, impairments, and customer disputes due to renewed pandemic intensity. This uncertainty also heightens the risks associated with GE's planned separation transactions, including the potential failure to realize expected benefits, diversion of management attention, increased volatility in results, and the inability to fund capital expenditures or meet debt obligations post-separation. For UNP, a prolonged recovery could further disrupt demand for its services, cause economic slowdowns, and increase financial market volatility, which could materially affect its results of operations and liquidity. Additionally, UNP notes that fuel price volatility, which may be influenced by the pace of recovery, introduces significant quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year financial volatility. Both companies highlight that the pace of recovery is a key determinant of their financial stability and performance.",

          "chunk_text": "on a different timeline than expected. If we are unable to complete any of the separations, we will have incurred costs without realizing the benefits of such transaction. In addition, the terms and conditions of the required regulatory authorizations and consents that are granted, if any, may impose requirements, limitations or costs, or place restrictions on the conduct of the independent companies. And, although we intend for the separation transactions to be tax-free to the Company's shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we expect to incur non-U.S. cash taxes on the preparatory restructuring and may also incur non-cash tax expense including potential impairments of deferred tax assets. Moreover, there can be no assurance that the separation transactions will qualify as taxfree for U.S. purposes. If the separation transactions were ultimately determined to be taxable, we would incur a significant tax liability, while the distributions to the Company's shareholders would become taxable and the new independent companies might incur income tax liabilities as well. Furthermore, if the separation transactions are completed, we cannot be assured that each separate company will be successful.\n\nWhether or not the separation transactions are completed, our businesses may face material challenges in connection with these transactions, including, without limitation the diversion of management's attention from ongoing business concerns and impact on the businesses of the Company; appropriately allocating assets and liabilities among the three companies, particularly given the staggered nature of the separation transactions; maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees; retaining existing or attracting new business and operational relationships, including with customers, suppliers, employees and other counterparties; assigning customer contracts and intellectual property to each of the businesses; and potential negative reactions from the financial markets. In particular, GE for the past several years has been undertaking various restructuring and business transformation actions (including workforce reductions, global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives) that have entailed changes across our organizational structure, senior leadership, culture, functional alignment, outsourcing and other areas. This poses risks in the form of personnel capacity constraints and institutional knowledge loss that could lead to missed performance or financial targets, loss of key personnel and harm to our reputation, and these risks are heightened with the additional interdependent actions that will be needed to complete the planned separation transactions. Moreover, completion of the separation transactions will result in the three independent public companies that are smaller, less diversified companies with more limited businesses concentrated in their respective industries than GE is today. As a result, each company may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the diversification of revenues, costs, and cash flows will diminish, such that each company's results of operations, cash flows, working capital, effective tax rate, and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility and its ability to fund capital expenditures and investments, pay dividends and meet debt obligations and other liabilities may be diminished. Each of the separate companies will also incur ongoing costs, including costs of operating as independent companies, that the separated businesses will no longer be able to share. Additionally, we cannot predict whether the market value of our common stock and the common stock of each of the new independent companies after the separation transactions will be, in the aggregate, less than, equal to or greater than the market value of our common stock prior to the separation transactions. If the separation transactions are completed, investors holding our common stock may sell the common stock of any of the new independent companies that do not match their investment strategies, which may cause a decline in the market price of such common stock.\n\nCOVID-19 - The global COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial performance, as well as on the operations and financial performance of many of the customers and suppliers in industries that we serve. Our operations and financial performance since early 2020 have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic that has caused, and may continue to cause, a slowdown of economic activity (including the decrease in demand for a broad variety of goods and services), disruptions in global supply chains and significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect economic activity globally or in various regions, the extent to which this will adversely impact our future operations and financial performance is uncertain. Across all of our businesses, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience operational challenges from the need to protect employee health and safety, site shutdowns, workplace disruptions and restrictions on the movement of people, raw materials and goods, both at our own facilities and at those of our customers and suppliers, global supply chain disruptions and price inflation. We also have experienced, and may continue experiencing, lower demand and volume for products and services, customer requests for potential payment deferrals or other contract modifications, supply chain under-liquidation, delays of deliveries and the achievement of other billing milestones, delays or cancellations of new projects and related down payments and other factors related directly and indirectly to the COVID-19 pandemic's effects on our customers that adversely impact our businesses. In particular, interruptions of regional and international air travel from COVID-19 are having a material adverse effect on our airline and airframer customers and their demand for our services and products. While our Aviation business is showing continued signs of recovery, the recently renewed intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic in many parts of the world could stall the recovery achieved to date and lead to future requests for payment deferrals, contract modifications, and similar actions across the aviation sector, which may lead to additional charges, impairments and other adverse financial impacts, or to customer disputes.\n\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control, including, but not limited, to: the severity and duration of the pandemic, including the impact of coronavirus variants and resurgences; governmental, business and individuals' actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic (including restrictions on travel and transport and workforce pressures); the impact of the pandemic and actions taken in response on global and regional economies, travel, and economic activity; the development, availability and public acceptance of effective treatments or vaccines; our employees' compliance with vaccine mandates that may apply in various jurisdictions; the availability of federal, state, local or non-U.S. funding programs; general economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility; global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; and the pace and extent of recovery when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. A number of accounting estimates that we make have been and will continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertainties related to these and other factors, and our accounting estimates and assumptions may change over time in response to COVID-19 (see Note 1). As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our operating and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risk factors described below.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOur business, financial condition, and results of operations have been adversely affected, and in the future, could be materially adversely affected by pandemics or other public health crises -  Our  business,  financial  condition,  and results of operations have been adversely affected by COVID. COVID has caused, and is expected to continue to cause, a global slowdown of economic activity (including the decrease in demand for a broad variety of goods), disruptions in global supply chains, and significant volatility and disruption of financial markets, resulting further in adverse  effects  on  workforces,  customers,  and  regional  and  local  economies.  Other  future  pandemics  or  public health crises may cause these same or similar consequences. Because the severity, magnitude, and duration of the COVID pandemic and its economic consequences are rapidly changing, and difficult to predict, the impact on our business and financial condition remains uncertain. The ultimate impact of the COVID pandemic on our results of operations and financial condition remains uncertain and depends on numerous evolving factors, which we may not be able to effectively respond to and are not entirely within our control. These factors also may be of importance for other  pandemics  or  public  health  crises,  including,  but  not  limited  to:  governmental,  business,  and  individuals' actions  that  have  been  and  continue  to  be  taken  in  response  to  a  global  pandemic  or  other  public  health crises  (including  restrictions  on  travel  and  transport,  workforce  pressures,  social  distancing,  and  shelter-in-place orders); the effect of a pandemic or other public health crises on economic activity and actions taken in response; the effect on our customers and their demand for our services; the effect of a pandemic or other public health crises on the credit-worthiness of our customers; national or global supply chain challenges or disruption; facility closures; commodity cost volatility; general economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility; global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; and the pace of recovery as the pandemic subsides as well as response to a potential reoccurrence. Further, a pandemic or other public health crises, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from such an event, could also precipitate and aggravate the other risk factors that  we  identify,  which  could  materially  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition,  results  of  operations (including revenues and profitability), and/or stock price. Additionally, a pandemic or other public health crises also may affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations.\n\n## Financial Risks\n\nWe  Are  Affected  By  Fluctuating  Fuel  Prices -  Fuel  costs  constitute  a  significant  portion  of  our  transportation expenses. Diesel fuel prices can be subject to dramatic fluctuations, and significant price increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Although we currently are able to recover a significant amount of our  fuel  expenses  from  our  customers  through  revenue  from  fuel  surcharges,  we  cannot  be  certain  that  we  will always  be  able  to  mitigate  rising  or  elevated  fuel  costs  through  our  fuel  surcharges.  Additionally,  future  market conditions  or  legislative  or  regulatory  activities  could  adversely  affect  our  ability  to  apply  fuel  surcharges  or adequately  recover  increased  fuel  costs  through  fuel  surcharges.  As  fuel  prices  fluctuate,  our  fuel  surcharge programs  trail  such  fluctuations  in  fuel  price  by  approximately  two  months,  and  may  be  a  significant  source  of quarter-over-quarter  and  year-over-year  volatility,  particularly  in  periods  of  rapidly  changing  prices.  International, political, and economic factors, events and conditions affect the volatility of fuel prices and supplies. Weather can also affect fuel supplies and limit domestic refining capacity. A severe shortage of, or disruption to, domestic fuel supplies  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  results  of  operations,  financial  condition,  and  liquidity. Alternatively, lower fuel prices could have a positive impact on the economy by increasing consumer discretionary spending that potentially could increase demand for various consumer products we transport. However, lower fuel prices could have a negative impact on other commodities we transport, such as coal and domestic drilling-related shipments, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\n\nWe Rely on Capital Markets - Due to the significant capital expenditures required to operate and maintain a safe and efficient railroad, we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements. We utilize longterm debt instruments, bank financing, and commercial paper, and we pledge certain amount of our receivables as collateral  for  credit.  Significant  instability  or  disruptions  of  the  capital  markets,  including  the  credit  markets,  or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit our access to, and significantly increase the cost of, commercial paper and other financing sources, including bank credit facilities and the issuance of long-term debt, including corporate bonds. A significant deterioration of our financial condition could result in a reduction of our credit rating to below investment grade, which could restrict or, at certain credit levels below investment grade, may prohibit us from utilizing our current receivables securitization facility  (Receivables Facility). This may also limit our access to external sources of capital and significantly increase the costs of short and long-term debt financing.\n\n## General Risk Factors\n\nWe Are Affected  by  General  Economic  Conditions -  Prolonged,  severe  adverse  domestic  and  global  economic conditions or disruptions of financial and credit markets, including inflation, may affect the producers and consumers of the commodities we carry and may have a material adverse effect on our access to liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\nWe May Be Affected by Acts of Terrorism, War, or Risk of War - Our rail lines, facilities, and equipment, including rail  cars  carrying  hazardous  materials,  could  be  direct  targets  or  indirect  casualties  of  terrorist  attacks.  Terrorist attacks, or other similar events, any government response thereto, and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. In addition, insurance premiums for some or all of our current coverages could increase dramatically, or certain coverages may not be available to us in the future.",

      "question": "How does the significance of foreign exchange hedging at Pratt & Whitney Canada influence the financial performance of RTX, and how does this risk compare to Honeywell's exposure to foreign exchange risk given their respective international operations?",
      "answer": "RTX specifically highlights the 'significant' transactional impact of foreign exchange hedging at Pratt & Whitney Canada on its overall operating results, indicating a material exposure to currency fluctuations due to its international operations. Similarly, Honeywell acknowledges exposure to foreign exchange risk from its global operations and actively engages in hedging activities to reduce volatility, though these activities bear financial costs and may not always be successful. Both companies rely on foreign exchange hedging to manage financial risk from international operations, but Pratt & Whitney Canada\u2019s exposure is explicitly called out as having a major impact on RTX\u2019s financial performance, suggesting a higher degree of sensitivity to currency movements in that specific business unit compared to Honeywell\u2019s broader approach.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Honeywell states they 'monitor and seek to reduce [foreign exchange risk] through hedging activities' and that these activities 'may not always be available... or successful in eliminating such volatility'.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - RTX notes that 'the transactional impact of foreign exchange hedging at Pratt & Whitney Canada' is significant and meaningfully affects its overall operating results.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies use foreign exchange hedging due to international operations, but RTX explicitly identifies Pratt & Whitney Canada\u2019s FX exposure as materially impactful to financial performance, while Honeywell presents a more general risk management approach."

In addition, positiv ely impacting the year-ov er-year comparison are lower labor agreement ratification  charges  as  we  reached  agreements  impacting  crew staffing  in  both  years,  and  lower  weather-related  costs  from  less impactful  winter  weather  in  the  first  quarter  of  2024  compared  to 2023.\n\n## 2024 Operating Expenses\n\nCompensation and Benefits - Compensation and benefits include wages, payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension costs, and incentiv e costs. In 2024, expenses increased 2% compared to 2023 due to wage inflation, which includes the impact of labor agreements to modernize work rules and improve av ailability, higher incentiv e compensation, and increased crew needs associated with labor agreements and increased v olumes, partially offset by 4% lower employee lev els. Train, engine, and yard (TE&amp;Y) force lev els were flat compared to 2023 as improv ed network fluidity allowed us to handle a 3% increase in v olumes and the increased needs associated with labor agreements without increasing the size of that workforce.\n\nPurchased Services and Materials - Expense for purchased serv ices and materials includes the costs of serv ices purchased from outside contractors and other serv ice prov iders (including equipment maintenance and contract expenses incurred by our subsidiaries for external transportation serv ices); materials  used  to  maintain  the  Railroad's  lines,  structures,  and  equipment;  costs  of  operating  facilities  jointly  used  by  UPRR  and  other  railroads; transportation and lodging for train crew employees; trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers; leased automobile maintenance expenses; and  tools  and  supplies.  Purchased  serv ices  and  materials  decreased  4%  in  2024compared  to2023driv en  by  declines  in  locomotiv e  maintenance expense due to a smaller activ e fleet as productiv ity improv ed year-ov er-year, decreased v olume-related drayage cost incurred at one of our subsidiaries, and a fav orable contract settlement, partially offset by inflation and v olume-related costs.\n\nFuel - Fuel includes locomotiv e fuel and gasoline for highway and non-highway v ehicles and heav y equipment. Fuel expense decreased compared to 2023 due to a decrease in locomotiv e diesel fuel prices, which av eraged $2.64 per gallon (including taxes and transportation costs) in 2024 compared to $3.09  per  gallon  in  2023,resulting  in  a  $0.4  billion  decrease  in  expense  (excluding  any  impact  from  decreased  v olumesyear-ov er-year),  and  a  1% improvement to the fuel consumption rate in 2024 (computed as gallons of fuel consumed div ided by gross ton-miles), partially offset by a 1% increase in gross ton-miles.\n\nDepreciation - The majority of depreciation relates to road property, including rail, ties, ballast, and other track material. Depreciation expense was up 3% in 2024 compared to 2023 due to a higher depreciable asset base.\n\nEquipment and Other Rents - Equipment and other rents expense primarily includes rental expense that the Railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or priv ate companies; freight car, intermodal, and locomotiv e leases; and office and other rent expenses, offset by equity income from certain equity method inv estments. Equipment and other rents expense decreased 3% compared to 2023due to lower lease expense and improv ed cycle times, partially offset by increased demand in commodities utilizing freight cars owned by others and inflation.\n\nOther -Other expenses include state and local taxes;freight, equipment, and property damage;utilities;insurance;personal injury;env ironmental;employee trav el;telephone and cellular;computer software;bad debt;and other general expenses. Other expenses decreased 8% in2024compared to2023driven by lower personal injury costs, a 2024 gain on the sale of intermodal equipment, and a 2023 write-off, partially offset by higher freight loss and damage and other casualty cost.\n\n## Non-Operating Items\n\n",

If we do not have sufficient capital or do not deploy sufficient capital in a timely manner to acquire, dev elop, or implement new technology or maintain or upgrade current systems, such as Positiv e Train Control (PTC) or the latest v ersion of our transportation control systems, we may suffer a rail serv ice outage or competitiv e disadv antage within the rail industry and with companies prov iding other modes of transportation serv ice, which could hav e a material adv erse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\n\nWe Are Subject to Cybersecurity Risks - We rely on information technology in all aspects of our business, including technology systems operated by us (whether created by us or purchased), under control of third parties, and open-source software.  We hav e experienced and will likely continue to experience v arying degrees of cyber incidents in the normal course of business. There can be no assurance that the resources we dev ote to protect our technology systems and proprietary data or the systems we hav e designed to identify, prev ent, or limit the effects of cyber incidents will be sufficient to prev ent or detect such incidents, or to av oid a material adv erse impact on our systems after such incidents do occur. Furthermore, due to the rising numbers  and  increasing  sophistication  of  cyber-attacks,  an  increasingly  complex  information  technology  supply  chain,  and  the  nature  of  zero-day exploits,  we  may be unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to prev ent a security breach, including by ransomware or as a result of human error or other cyber-attack methods, from materially affecting our systems or the systems of third-parties upon which we rely. The rapid ev olution and  increased  av ailability  of  artificial  intelligence  may  intensify  cybersecurity  risks  by  making  cyber-attacks  more  sophisticated  and  cybersecurity incidents more difficult to detect, contain, and mitigate. A cyber incident that results in significant serv ice interruption; safety failure; other operational difficulties; unauthorized access to (or the loss of access to) competitiv ely sensitiv e, confidential, or other critical data or systems; loss of customers; financial losses; regulatory fines; reputational harm; or misuse or corruption of critical data and proprietary information, could hav e a material adv erse impact  on  our  results  of  operations,  financial  condition,  and  liquidity.  We  may  experience  security  breaches  that  could  remain  undetected  for  an extended  period  and,  therefore,  hav e  a  greater  impact  on  us. Additionally,  we  may  be  exposed  to  increased  cybersecurity  risk  because  we  are  a component of the critical U.S. infrastructure.\n\nSevere Weather and Natural Events Could Result in Significant Business Interruptions and Expenditures - As a railroad with a v ast network, we are exposed to severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena, including earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, mudslides or landslides, extreme temperatures,  av alanches,  and  significant  precipitation,  and  climate  change  may  cause  or  contribute  to  the  sev erity  or  frequency  of  such  weather conditions. Line outages and other interruptions caused by these conditions hav e in the past and could in the future adv ersely affect parts or all of our rail network, potentially negativ ely affecting rev enues, costs, and liabilities, despite efforts we undertake to plan for these ev ents. Our rev enues can also be adversely affected by sev ere weather that causes damage and disruptions to our customers. These impacts caused by sev ere weather or other natural phenomena could have a material adv erse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\n\nA  Significant  Portion  of  Our  Revenues  Involves  Transportation  of  Commodities  to  and  from  International  M arkets -  Although  rev enues  from  our operations are attributable to transportation serv ices prov ided in the U.S., a significant portion of our rev enues inv olv es the transportation of commodities to and from international markets, including Mexico, Canada, and Southeast Asia, by v arious carriers and, at times, v arious modes of transportation.

Revenue from products and services transferred to customers over time accounted for 78% of our revenue in 2021, 77% in 2020  and  73%  in  2019.  Substantially  all  of  our  revenue  in  the  defense  segments  is  recognized  over  time, because control is transferred continuously to our customers. Typically, revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts,  the  transfer  of  control  to  the  customer.  Contract  costs  include  labor,  material,  overhead  and,  when appropriate, G&amp;A expenses.\n\nRevenue from goods and services  transferred  to  customers  at  a  point  in  time  accounted  for  22%  of  our revenue in 2021, 23% in 2020 and 27% in 2019. Most of our revenue recognized at a point in time is for the manufacture of business jet aircraft in our Aerospace segment. Revenue on these contracts is recognized when the customer obtains control of the asset, which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the fully outfitted aircraft.\n\nOn December 31, 2021, we had $87.6 billion of remaining performance obligations, which we also refer to as  total  backlog.  We  expect  to  recognize  approximately  35%  of  our  remaining  performance  obligations  as revenue in 2022, an additional 35% by the end of 2024 and the balance thereafter.\n\nContract Estimates. The majority of our revenue is derived from long-term contracts and programs that can span several years. Accounting for long-term contracts and programs involves the use of various techniques to estimate total contract revenue and costs. For long-term contracts, we estimate the profit on a contract as the difference  between the total  estimated  revenue  and  expected  costs  to  complete  a  contract  and  recognize  that profit over the life of the contract.\n\nContract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that often span several years. These assumptions include labor productivity and availability; the complexity of the work to be performed; the cost and availability of materials; the performance of subcontractors; and the availability and timing of funding from the customer.\n\nThe nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including claims, award fees and incentive fees. We include in our contract estimates additional revenue for submitted contract modifications or claims against the customer when we believe we have an enforceable right to the modification or claim, the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable. In evaluating these criteria, we consider the contractual/legal basis for the claim, the cause of any additional costs incurred, the reasonableness of those costs and  the  objective  evidence  available  to  support  the  claim.  We  include  award  fees  or  incentive  fees  in  the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee. These estimates are based on historical award experience, anticipated performance and our best judgment at the time.\n\nAs a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts, we review  and  update  our  contract-related  estimates  regularly.  We  recognize  adjustments  in  estimated  profit  on contracts  under  the  cumulative  catch-up  method.  Under  this  method,  the  impact  of  the  adjustment  on  profit recorded to date on a contract is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified. Revenue and profit in future periods of contract performance are recognized using the adjusted estimate. If at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on the contract, we recognize the total loss in the period it is identified.",

The  communication  of  critical  audit  matters  does  not  alter  in  any  way  our  opinion  on  the  consolidated financial  statements,  taken  as  a  whole,  and  we  are  not,  by  communicating  the  critical  audit  matters  below,  providing  separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Revenue Recognition - Contract Estimates at Completion\n\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, a significant portion of the Company's revenues of $64.4 billion for the  year  ended  December  31,  2021  are  from  long-term  contracts  associated  with  the  design,  development,  manufacture  or modification  of  complex  aerospace  or  defense  equipment  or  related  services.  The  timing  of  the  satisfaction  of  performance obligations varies across the Company's businesses due to their diverse product and service mix, customer base, and contractual terms. Substantially all of the Company's revenues from the Raytheon Intelligence &amp; Space and Raytheon Missiles &amp; Defense segments are recognized over time because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer. The Company's revenues from certain long-term aftermarket contracts within its Pratt &amp; Whitney segment are recognized over the contract period as a series of daily  performance  obligations  to  stand  ready  to  provide  spare  parts,  product  maintenance  and  aftermarket  services.  For  the performance obligations satisfied over time, revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of  the  Company's performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment by management on a contract by contract basis. Within the Raytheon Intelligence &amp; Space and Raytheon Missiles &amp; Defense segments, the variables and significant judgments relate to key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. The risks and opportunities for the contracts relate to management's ability and cost to achieve the schedule, consideration of customer-directed delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries, technical requirements, customer activity levels and related variable consideration. Management also makes judgments about variables related to estimates of labor productivity and availability, the complexity and scope of the work to be performed, the availability and cost of materials, the length of time to complete the performance obligation, execution by the Company's subcontractors, the availability and timing of funding from the customer, overhead cost rates, and the estimated cost of satisfying the Company's industrial cooperation agreements required under certain  contracts.  Within  the  Pratt  &amp;  Whitney  segment,  the  variables  and  significant  judgments  relate  to  current  and  past maintenance cost and frequency experience. Management reviews contract estimates at completion on a periodic basis and no less than annually or when a change in circumstances warrants a modification to a previous estimate.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition - contract estimates at completion is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in developing their estimates of total revenue and  total  costs  at  completion,  including  significant  judgments  and  assumptions  on  a  contract  by  contract  basis,  and  (ii)  a  high degree  of  auditor  judgment,  subjectivity,  and  effort  in  performing  procedures  and  in  evaluating  audit  evidence  related  to management's estimates of total revenue and total cost at completion for contracts.\n\nAddressing  the  matter  involved  performing  procedures  and  evaluating  audit  evidence  in  connection  with  forming  our  overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over the estimates of total revenue and total costs at completion. These procedures also included, among others, testing management's process for developing the estimated total revenue and total costs at completion, including evaluating on a test basis the reasonableness of certain significant judgments and variables considered by management specific to each contract or performance obligation. Evaluating the significant judgments and assumptions related to the estimates of total revenue and total costs at completion involved evaluating whether the significant judgments and assumptions used were reasonable  considering:  (i)  management's  historical  forecasting  accuracy,  (ii)  evidence  to  support  the  relevant  aforementioned variables,  (iii)  the  consistent  application  of  accounting  policies,  and  (iv)  the  timely  identification  of  circumstances  which  may warrant a modification to a previous estimate.",

      "question": "Given that both General Dynamics and Raytheon use cost-based methods for recognizing revenue on long-term defense contracts, how does the scale of Raytheon's $64.4 billion in contract revenue impact the financial comparability between the two companies, considering the inherent subjectivity in estimating total costs at completion?",
      "answer": "Raytheon\u2019s $64.4 billion in contract revenue, recognized primarily over time using cost-based progress measures, introduces a significant level of estimation subjectivity due to variables such as labor productivity, subcontractor performance, and funding availability. General Dynamics similarly relies on cost-to-cost methods and acknowledges that changes in contract estimates can materially affect profitability. The magnitude of Raytheon\u2019s contract revenue, compared to General Dynamics\u2019 defense-focused contracts, amplifies the potential for financial statement variability due to estimation differences, making direct comparisons between the two companies\u2019 financial performance less reliable unless adjustments are made for estimation risk.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - The shared use of cost-based estimation methods for long-term defense contracts introduces comparability challenges, especially given the scale of Raytheon\u2019s $64.4 billion in revenue, which heightens the financial impact of estimation variability."

We  employ  judgment  in  making  our  estimates,  but  they  are  based  on historical  experience,  currently  available  information  and  various  other  assumptions  that  we  believe  to  be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe our judgment is applied  consistently  and  produces  financial  information  that  fairly  depicts  our  results  of  operations  for  all periods presented.\n\nIn  our  opinion,  the  following  policies  are  critical  and  require  the  use  of  significant  judgment  in  their application:\n\nRevenue. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer,  and  is  the  unit  of  account  for  revenue. A  contract's  transaction  price  is  allocated  to  each  distinct performance obligation within that contract and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. Our performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in time.\n\nSubstantially  all  of  our  revenue  in  the  defense  segments  is  recognized  over  time,  because  control  is transferred continuously to our customers. Typically, revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date  relative  to  total  estimated  costs  at  completion  to  measure  progress  toward  satisfying  our  performance obligations.  Incurred  cost  represents  work  performed,  which  corresponds  with,  and  thereby  best  depicts,  the transfer  of  control  to  the  customer.  Contract  costs  include  labor,  material,  overhead  and,  when  appropriate, G&amp;A expenses.\n\nMost  of  our  revenue  recognized  at  a  point  in  time  is  for  the  manufacture  of  business  jet  aircraft  in  our Aerospace segment. Revenue on these contracts is recognized when the customer obtains control of the asset, which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the fully outfitted aircraft.\n\nThe majority of our revenue is derived from long-term contracts and programs that can span several years. Accounting  for  long-term  contracts  and  programs  involves  the  use  of  various  techniques  to  estimate  total contract  revenue  and  costs.  For  long-term  contracts,  we  estimate  the  profit  on  a  contract  as  the  difference between the total estimated revenue and expected costs to complete a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract.\n\nContract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that often span several years. These assumptions include labor productivity and availability; the complexity of the work to be performed; the cost and availability of materials; the performance of subcontractors; and the availability and timing of funding from the customer.\n\nThe nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including claims, award fees and incentive fees. We include in our contract estimates additional revenue for submitted contract modifications or claims against the customer when we believe we have an enforceable right to the modification or claim, the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable. In evaluating these criteria, we consider the contractual/legal basis for the claim, the cause of any additional costs incurred, the reasonableness of those costs and  the  objective  evidence  available  to  support  the  claim.  We  include  award  fees  or  incentive  fees  in  the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee. These estimates are based on historical award experience, anticipated performance and our best judgment at the time.\n\nAs a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts, we review  and  update  our  contract-related  estimates  regularly.  We  recognize  adjustments  in  estimated  profit  on contracts under the cumulative catch-up method. Under this method, the impact of",

Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws.  Our operations outside the United States, including in developing countries, expose us to the risk of such violations. Violations of anti-corruption laws or regulations by our employees, intermediaries acting on our behalf, or our joint venture partners may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions. Violations may also disrupt our business, and may result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.\n\n## International trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position.\n\nGovernment policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas, capital controls or tariffs, whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries.  The implementation of more restrictive trade policies (such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs or new barriers to entry) in countries where we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  For example, a government's adoption of 'buy national' policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\n\n## We may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings between U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions or among jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates. In addition, our future results of operations could also be adversely affected by changes in our overall profitability, changes in tax laws or treaties or in their application or interpretation, changes in tax rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures. We are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations. If our effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. For information regarding additional legal matters related to our taxes, please see Note 6 - 'Income taxes' and Note 22 - 'Environmental and legal matters' of Part II, Item 8 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Costs associated with lawsuits or investigations or adverse rulings in enforcement or other legal proceedings may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\nWe are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in virtually every part of the world. We face risk of exposure to various types of claims, lawsuits and government investigations. We are involved in various claims and lawsuits related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including claimed asbestos exposure), contracts, employment issues, environmental matters, intellectual property rights, tax, securities and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business.  The industries in which we operate are also periodically reviewed or investigated by regulators, which could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims.  It is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims, investigations and lawsuits, and we could in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations or financial condition in any particular period.\n\nThe global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time. In addition, subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves.

We  also  could  be  adversely  affected  by,  or  liable  for,  actions  taken  by  these  joint  ventures  that  we  do  not  control, including violations of anti-corruption, import and export, taxation and anti-boycott laws.\n\nDepending on our rights and percentage of ownership, we may consolidate the financial results of such entities or account for our interests under the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting for nonconsolidated ventures and investments, we recognize our share of the operating profit or loss of these joint ventures in our results of operations. Our operating results are affected  by  the  conduct  and  performance  of  businesses  over  which  we  do  not  exercise  control  and,  as  a  result,  we  may  not  be successful  in  achieving  the  growth  or  other  intended  benefits  of  strategic  investments.  Our  equity  investments  had  the  greatest impact on our Space business segment where approximately 6% of its 2021 operating profit was derived from its share of earnings from equity method investees, primarily that in United Launch Alliance (ULA).\n\nThrough our Lockheed Martin Ventures Fund, we make investments in early-stage companies that we believe are advancing or developing  new  technologies  applicable  to  our  core  businesses  and  new  initiatives  important  to  Lockheed  Martin.  These investments may be in the forms of common or preferred stock, warrants, convertible debt securities or investments in funds and are generally illiquid at the time of investment, which limits our ability to exit an investment or realize an investment absent a liquidity  event. Typically,  we  hold  a  non-controlling  interest  and,  therefore,  are  unable  to  influence  strategic  decisions  by  these companies and may have limited visibility into their activities, which may result in our not realizing the intended benefits of the investments. For fund investments, we have even less influence and visibility as a non-controlling investor in a fund that invests in other companies. We may recognize significant gains or losses attributable to adjustments of the investments' fair value, including impairments up to and including the full value of the investment, which can be affected by the success of the companies, market volatility and changes in valuations of our investment holdings.\n\n## Risks  Related  to  Significant  Contingencies,  Uncertainties  and  Estimates,  including  Pension,  Taxes,  Environmental  and Litigation Costs\n\nPension funding and costs are dependent on several economic assumptions which if changed may cause our future earnings and cash flow to fluctuate significantly as well as affect the affordability of our products and services.\n\nMany of our employees and retirees participate in defined benefit pension plans, retiree medical and life insurance plans, and other postemployment plans (collectively, postretirement benefit plans). The impact of these plans on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because the calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic assumptions including interest rates and rates of return on plan assets, other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity (also known as mortality) and employee turnover, as well as the timing of cash funding. Changes in these factors, including actual returns on plan assets, may also affect our plan funding, cash flow and stockholders' equity.\n\nWith regard to cash flow, we have made substantial cash contributions to our plans as required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended, and expect to make future contributions as required or when deemed prudent. We  generally  can  recover  a  significant  portion  of  these  contributions  related  to  our  plans  as  allowable  costs  on  our  U.S. Government contracts,  including  FMS.  However,  there  is  a  lag  between  the  time  when  we  contribute  cash  to  our  plans  under pension funding rules and when we recover pension costs under U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which can affect the timing of our cash flows.\n\nIn recent years, we have taken actions to mitigate the risk related to our defined benefit pension plans through pension risk transfer  transactions  whereby  we  purchase  group  annuity  contracts  (GACs)  from  insurance  companies  using  assets  from  the pension trust and expect to continue to evaluate such transactions in the future. Although under the majority of the GACs we have purchased we are relieved of all responsibility for the associated pension obligations, we have purchased and may in the future purchase GACs whereby the insurance company reimburses the pension plans but we remain responsible for paying benefits under the plans to covered retirees and beneficiaries and are subject to the risk that the insurance company will default on its obligations to reimburse the pension trusts. While we believe pension risk transfer transactions are beneficial, future transactions, depending on their size, could result in us making additional contributions to the pension trust and/or require us to recognize noncash settlement charges in earnings in the applicable reporting period.\n\nFor more information on how these factors could impact earnings, financial position, cash flow and stockholders' equity, see 'Critical Accounting Policies - Postretirement Benefit Plans' in the MD&amp;A and 'Note 12 - Postretirement Benefit Plans' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.",

      "answer": "LMT performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test for its Sikorsky reporting unit in 2021 and found that the fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately 30%. This margin indicates a significant buffer above impairment risk for LMT's Sikorsky unit. In contrast, CAT utilizes either a qualitative or quantitative approach for goodwill impairment testing and only proceeds to a quantitative test if the qualitative assessment does not conclude that fair value more likely than not exceeds carrying value. CAT does not specify a defined margin for qualitative assessments, relying instead on management judgment and a comparison of fair value to carrying value in the quantitative step. Therefore, while LMT's 30% margin provides a measurable buffer against impairment, CAT's approach does not define a specific threshold but depends on the outcome of its qualitative evaluation.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\nFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1J - 'New accounting guidance' of Part II, Item 8 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The more significant estimates include: residual values for leased assets, fair  values  for  goodwill  impairment  tests,  warranty  liability,  reserves  for  product  liability  and  insurance  losses,  postretirement benefits, post-sale discounts, credit losses and income taxes. We have incorporated many years of data into the determination of each of these estimates and we have not historically experienced significant adjustments. We review these assumptions at least annually with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Following are the methods and assumptions used in determining our estimates and an indication of the risks inherent in each.\n\nResidual values for leased assets - We determine the residual value of Cat Financial's leased equipment based on its estimated end-of-term market value. We estimate the residual value of leased equipment at the inception of the lease based on a number of factors, including historical wholesale market sales prices, past remarketing experience and any known significant market/product trends. We also consider the following critical factors in our residual value estimates: lease term, market size and demand, total expected hours of usage, machine configuration, application, location, model changes, quantities, third-party residual guarantees and contractual customer purchase options.\n\nUpon termination of the lease, the equipment is either purchased by the lessee or sold to a third party, in which case we may record a gain or a loss for the difference between the estimated residual value and the sale price.\n\nDuring the term of our leases, we monitor residual values.  For operating leases, we record adjustments to depreciation expense reflecting changes in residual value estimates prospectively on a straight-line basis. For finance leases, we recognize residual value adjustments through a reduction of finance revenue over the remaining lease term.\n\nWe evaluate the carrying value of equipment on operating leases for potential impairment when we determine a triggering event has occurred. When a triggering event occurs, we perform a test for recoverability by comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases. If the test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment, we measure  the  fair  value  of  the  equipment  on  operating  leases  in  accordance  with  the  fair  value  measurement  framework.  We recognize  an  impairment  charge  for  the  amount  by  which  the  carrying  value  of  the  equipment  on  operating  leases  exceeds  its estimated fair value.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases was $1.87 billion. Without consideration of other factors such as third-party residual guarantees or contractual customer purchase options, a 10 percent non-temporary decrease in the market value of our equipment subject to operating leases would reduce residual value estimates and result in the recognition of approximately $85 million of additional annual depreciation expense.\n\nFair values for goodwill impairment tests - We test goodwill for impairment annually, at the reporting unit level, and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell all or a portion of a reporting unit. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis.\n\nWe review  goodwill  for  impairment  utilizing  either  a  qualitative  assessment  or  a  quantitative  goodwill  impairment  test.  If  we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary. For reporting units where we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of  each  reporting  unit,  which  we  primarily  determine  using  an  income  approach  based  on  the  present  value  of  discounted  cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, we do not consider the goodwill impaired. If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, we recognize the difference as an impairment loss.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\nThe assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Intangible assets from acquired businesses are recognized at fair value on the acquisition date and consist of customer programs, trademarks, customer relationships, technology and other intangible assets. Customer programs include values assigned to major programs of acquired businesses and represent the aggregate value associated with the customer relationships, contracts, technology and trademarks underlying the associated program. Intangible assets are amortized over a period of expected cash flows used to measure fair value, which ranges from five to 20 years.\n\nOur goodwill balance was $10.8 billion at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. We perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. Such events or changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, changes in the business climate of our industry, a decline in our market capitalization, operating performance indicators, competition, reorganizations of our business, U.S. Government budget restrictions or the disposal of all or a portion of a reporting unit.  Our  goodwill  has  been  allocated  to  and  is  tested  for  impairment  at  a  level  referred  to  as  the  reporting  unit,  which  is  our business segment level or a level below the business segment. The level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires us to determine  whether  the  operations  below  the  business  segment  constitute  a  self-sustaining  business  for  which  discrete  financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results.\n\nWe may use both qualitative and quantitative approaches when testing goodwill for impairment. For selected reporting units where we use the qualitative approach, we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment. Based on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further evaluation is necessary. Otherwise, we perform a quantitative impairment test. We perform quantitative tests for most reporting units at least once every three years. However, for certain reporting units we may perform a quantitative impairment test every year.\n\nTo perform the quantitative  impairment  test,  we  compare  the  fair  value  of  a  reporting  unit  to  its  carrying  value,  including goodwill.  If  the  fair  value  of  a  reporting  unit  exceeds  its  carrying  value,  goodwill  of  the  reporting  unit  is  not  impaired.  If  the carrying  value  of  the  reporting  unit,  including  goodwill,  exceeds  its  fair  value,  a  goodwill  impairment  loss  is  recognized  in  an amount equal to that excess. We generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow  (DCF) analysis  and  market-based  valuation  methodologies  such  as  comparable  public  company  trading  values  and  values observed  in  recent  business  acquisitions.  Determining  fair  value  requires  the  exercise  of  significant  judgments,  including  the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and relevant transaction multiples. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are based on our best estimate of  future  sales,  earnings  and  cash  flows  after  considering  factors  such  as  general  market  conditions,  U.S.  Government  budgets, existing  firm  orders,  expected  future  orders,  contracts  with  suppliers,  labor  agreements,  changes  in  working  capital,  long  term business  plans  and  recent  operating  performance.  The  discount  rates  utilized  in  the  DCF  analysis  are  based  on  the  respective reporting  unit's  weighted  average  cost  of  capital,  which  takes  into  account  the  relative  weights  of  each  component  of  capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future  cash  flows  of  the  respective  reporting  unit.  The  carrying  value  of  each  reporting  unit  includes  the  assets  and  liabilities employed in its operations, goodwill and allocations of amounts held at the business segment and corporate levels.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units. The results of that test indicated that for each of our reporting units no impairment existed. As of the date of our annual impairment test, the fair value  of  our  Sikorsky  reporting  unit  exceeded  its  carrying  value,  which  included  goodwill  of  $2.7  billion,  by  a  margin  of approximately 30%. The fair value of our Sikorsky reporting unit can be significantly impacted by its performance, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, contract terminations, changes in expected future orders, general market pressures, including U.S. Government budgetary constraints, discount rates, long term growth rates, and changes in U.S. (federal or state) or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including those with retroactive effect, along with other significant judgments.  Based  on  our  assessment  of  these  circumstances,  we  have  determined  that  goodwill  at  our  Sikorsky  reporting  unit remains at risk for impairment should there be a deterioration of projected cash flows of the reporting unit.\n\nImpairment  assessments  inherently  involve  management  judgments  regarding  a  number  of  assumptions  such  as  those described above. Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit's fair value and the relative size of our recorded  goodwill,  differences  in  assumptions  could  have  a  material  effect  on  the  estimated  fair  value  of  one  or  more  of  our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.",

We perform regular credit evaluations of our dealers and customers. Collateral generally is not required, and the majority of our trade receivables are unsecured. We do, however, when deemed necessary, make use of various  devices  such  as  security  agreements  and  letters  of  credit  to  protect  our  interests.  No  single  dealer  or  customer represents a significant concentration of credit risk.\n\nFinance  receivables  and  wholesale  inventory  receivables  primarily  represent  receivables  under  installment  sales  contracts, receivables arising from leasing transactions and notes receivable. We typically maintain a security interest in retail financed equipment  and,  in  some  instances,  wholesale  financed  equipment.  We  also  typically  require  physical  damage  insurance coverage on financed equipment. No single customer or dealer represented a significant concentration of credit risk.\n\nShort-term and long-term investments are held with high quality institutions and, by policy, the amount of credit exposure to any  one  institution  is  limited.  Long-term  investments,  primarily  included  in  Other  assets  in  Statement  3,  are  comprised primarily of available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities at Insurance Services.\n\nFor derivative contracts, collateral is generally not required of the counterparties or of our company.  The company generally enters into International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting agreements within ME&amp;T and Financial Products that permit the net settlement of amounts owed under their respective derivative contracts.  Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties is limited to only those gains that we have recorded, but for which we have not yet received cash payment. The master netting agreements reduce the amount of loss the company would incur should the counterparties fail to meet their obligations.  At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the maximum exposure to credit loss was $342 million and $281 million, respectively, before the application of any master netting agreements.\n\nPlease refer to Note 18 above for fair value information.\n\n## 20. Leases\n\n## A. Lessee arrangements\n\nWe lease certain property, information technology equipment, warehouse equipment, vehicles and other equipment through operating  leases.

To determine the present value of lease payments for most of our leases, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on information available on the lease commencement date. For certain property and information technology equipment leases, we have elected to separate payments for lease components from non-lease components. For all other leases, we have elected not to separate payments for lease and non-lease components. Our lease agreements may include options to extend or terminate  the  lease.  When  it  is  reasonably  certain  that  we  will  exercise  that  option,  we  have  included  the  option  in  the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. We have elected not to recognize right-of-use assets or lease liabilities for leases with a term of twelve months or less.\n\nOur finance leases are not significant and therefore are not included in the following disclosures.\n\nThe components of lease costs were as follows:\n\n",

The discount rates utilized in the DCF analysis are based on the respective reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. The carrying value of each reporting unit includes the assets and liabilities employed in its operations, goodwill and allocations of certain assets and liabilities held at the business segment and corporate levels.\n\nDuring  the  fourth  quarters  of  2021,  2020  and  2019,  we  performed  our  annual  goodwill  impairment  test  for  each  of  our reporting units. The results of our annual impairment tests of goodwill indicated that no impairment existed.\n\nAcquired intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment testing. This testing  compares carrying value to fair value and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. Finite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over the applicable useful lives, ranging from five to 20 years, based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic benefit as reflected by future net cash inflows. We perform an impairment test of finite-lived intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may be impaired.\n\nLeases - We evaluate whether our contractual arrangements contain leases at the inception of such arrangements. Specifically, we consider whether we can control the underlying asset and have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits or outputs from the asset. Substantially all of our leases are long-term operating leases with fixed payment terms. We do not have significant financing leases. Our right-of-use (ROU) operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease  term,  and  our  operating  lease  liabilities  represent  our  obligation  to  make  lease  payments.  ROU  operating  lease  assets  are recorded  in  other  noncurrent  assets  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheet.  Operating  lease  liabilities  are  recorded  in  other  current liabilities or other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet based on their contractual due dates.\n\nBoth the ROU operating lease asset and liability are recognized as of the lease commencement date at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. Most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate that can readily be determined. Therefore, we use a discount rate based on our incremental borrowing rate, which is determined using our credit rating and information available as of the commencement date. ROU operating lease assets include lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, net of any lease incentives.\n\nOur operating lease agreements may include options to extend the lease term or terminate it early. We include options to extend or  terminate  leases  in  the  ROU  operating  lease  asset  and  liability  when  it  is  reasonably  certain  we  will  exercise  these  options. Operating  lease  expense  is  recognized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  lease  term  and  is  included  in  cost  of  sales  on  our consolidated statement of earnings.\n\nWe have operating lease arrangements with lease and non-lease components. The non-lease components in our arrangements are  not  significant  when  compared  to  the  lease  components.  For  all  operating  leases,  we  account  for  the  lease  and  non-lease components as a single component. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to recognize operating lease ROU assets and liabilities. We evaluate ROU assets for impairment consistent with our property, plant and equipment policy.\n\nPostretirement  benefit  plans -  Many  of  our  employees  and  retirees  participate  in  defined  benefit  pension  plans,  retiree medical and life insurance plans, and other postemployment plans (collectively, postretirement benefit plans). GAAP requires that the amounts we record related to our postretirement benefit plans be computed, based on service to date, using actuarial valuations that are based in part on certain key economic assumptions we make, including the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity (also known as mortality), health care cost trend rates and employee turnover, each as appropriate based on the nature of the plans.\n\nA market-related value of our plan assets, determined using actual asset gains or losses over the prior three year period, is used to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. These asset gains or losses, along with those resulting from adjustments to our benefit obligation, will be amortized to expense using the corridor method, where gains and losses are recognized over a period of years to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater of plan assets or benefit obligations.\n\nWe recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans as either an asset recorded within other noncurrent assets or a liability recorded within noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The GAAP funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan's assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. The funded status under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended, is calculated on a different basis than under GAAP.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation.\n\n## Restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility.\n\nWe maintain a number of credit facilities to support general corporate purposes (facilities) and have issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations (debt securities).  The agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us and certain subsidiaries, including Cat Financial.  These covenants include maintaining a minimum consolidated net worth (defined as the consolidated shareholder's equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other post-retirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)), limitations on the incurrence of liens and certain restrictions on consolidation and merger. Cat Financial has also agreed under certain of these agreements not to exceed a certain leverage ratio (consolidated debt to consolidated net worth, calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each December 31), to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio (profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to interest expense, calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended) and not to terminate, amend or modify its support agreement with us.\n\nA breach of one or more of the covenants could result in adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. These consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the facilities, triggering of an obligation to redeem certain debt securities, termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders, refusal by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to enter into new facilities or the lowering or modification of our credit ratings or those of one or more of our subsidiaries.\n\n## Sustained increases in funding obligations under our pension plans may impair our liquidity or financial condition.\n\nWe maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for our employees, which impose on us certain funding obligations. In determining our future payment obligations under the plans, we assume certain rates of return on the plan assets and a certain level of future benefit payments. Significant adverse changes in credit or capital markets could result in actual rates of return being materially lower than projected and result in increased contribution requirements.  We expect to make contributions to our pension plans in the future, and may be required to make contributions that could be material.  We may fund contributions through the use of cash on hand, the proceeds of borrowings, shares of our common stock or a combination of the foregoing, as permitted by applicable law. These factors could significantly increase our payment obligations under the plans, and as a result, adversely affect our business and overall financial condition.\n\n## LEGAL &amp; REGULATORY RISKS\n\n## Our global operations are subject to a wide-range of trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations.\n\nDue to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations. These include U.S. regulations issued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Antiboycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries.  Any alleged or actual violations may subject us to increased government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the United States.  Furthermore, embargoes and sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other governments restricting or prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries or based on product classification may expose us to potential criminal and civil sanctions. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject. We also cannot predict in certain locations the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.",

International sales are subject to numerous political and economic factors, budget uncertainty, regulatory requirements, significant competition, taxation, and other risks associated with doing business outside the U.S. In international sales, we face substantial competition from both  U.S.  manufacturers  and  international  manufacturers  whose  governments  sometimes  provide  research  and  development assistance, marketing subsidies and other assistance for their products and services.\n\nOur international business is conducted through foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government and by direct commercial sales (DCS) to international customers. FMS contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to the FAR and the DFARS. In contrast, DCS transactions represent sales by us directly to international customers and are not subject to the FAR or the DFARS, although they are subject to the procurement regulations of the international customer. Sales to international customers are subject  to  U.S.  and  foreign  laws  and  regulations,  including  import-export  control,  technology  transfer  restrictions,  investments, taxation,  repatriation  of  earnings,  exchange  controls,  the  Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act  and  other  anti-corruption  laws  and regulations, and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Control Reform Act of 2018. While we have extensive policies in place to comply with such laws and regulations, failure by us, our employees or others working on our behalf to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities, including suspension, debarment from bidding for or performing government contracts, or suspension of our export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We frequently team with international subcontractors and suppliers who also are exposed to similar risks.\n\nInternational  sales  present  risks  that  are  different  and  potentially  greater  than  those  encountered  in  our  U.S.  business.  We believe DCS transactions present the greatest potential risks because they involve direct commercial relationships with parties with whom we typically have less familiarity. Additionally, international procurement and local country rules and regulations, contract laws, and judicial systems differ from those in the U.S. and, in some cases, may be less developed than in the U.S., which could impair our ability to enforce contracts and increase the risk of adverse or unpredictable outcomes, including the possibility that certain matters that would be considered civil matters in the U.S. are treated as criminal matters in other countries.\n\nIn  conjunction  with  defense  procurements,  some  international  customers  require  contractors  to  comply  with  industrial cooperation regulations, including entering into industrial participation or industrial development agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services. Industrial participation or development agreements generally extend over several years and obligate the contractor to perform certain commitments, which may include incountry  purchases,  technology  transfers,  local  manufacturing  support,  consulting  support  to  in-country  projects,  investments  in joint ventures and financial support projects. The customer's expectations in respect of the scope of offset commitments can be substantial, including high-value content, and may exceed existing local technical capability. Failure to meet these commitments, which can be subjective and outside of our control, may result in significant penalties, and could lead to a reduction in sales to a country. Furthermore, certain of our existing industrial development agreements are dependent upon the successful operation of joint ventures that we do not control and involve products and services that are outside of our core business, which may increase the risk that we fail to meet our industrial cooperation agreements, expose us to compliance risks of the joint venture and impair our ability to recover our investment. For more information on our industrial development obligations, including the notional value of our remaining industrial development obligations and potential penalties for non-compliance, see 'Contractual Commitments' in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&amp;A).\n\n## Geopolitical issues and considerations could have a significant effect on our business.\n\nOur international  business  is  highly  sensitive  to  changes  in  regulations  (including  tariffs,  sanctions,  embargoes,  export  and import controls and other trade restrictions), political environments or security risks that may affect our ability to conduct business outside of the U.S., including those regarding investment, procurement, taxation and repatriation of earnings.\n\nOn July 14, 2020 and again on October 26, 2020, the People's Republic of China (China) announced it may impose sanctions against Lockheed Martin in response to Congressional Notifications of potential Foreign Military Sales to Taiwan, which included sales of Lockheed Martin products. We will continue to follow official U.S. Government guidance as it relates to sales to Taiwan and do not see a material impact on our sales at this time. China has not specified the nature of any such sanctions, but could seek to restrict our commercial sales or supply chain, including the supply of rare earth or other raw materials, and could also impose sanctions on our suppliers, teammates or partners. The nature, timing and potential impact of any sanctions that may be imposed by China or any other related actions that may be taken are uncertain.",

Disclosures of risks should not be interpreted to imply that the risks have not already materialized, and there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known.\n\n## MACROECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY RISKS\n\nEach of our businesses is subject to unique industry and economic conditions that may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations.\n\n- Aerospace Technologies -Our Aerospace business is impacted by customer buying patterns of aftermarket parts, supplier stability , factory transitions, and global supply chain capacity constraints that may lead to shortages of crucial components. Operating results may be adversely affected by downturns in the global demand for air travel, which may impact new aircraft production or result in the delay or cancellation of new aircraft orders, delays in launch schedules for new aircrafts, the retirement of aircrafts, and reductions in global flying hours, which impacts air transport and regional, business, and general aviation aircraft utiliz ation rates. O perating results may  also be adversely affected by any decrease in air travel demand due to regional restrictions or suspension of service for events related to public health, safety , the environment, or regional conflicts. Operating results could also be impacted by changes in overall trends related to end market demand for the product portfolio, as well as new entrants and non-traditional players entering the market. Operating results in our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by the mix of U.S. and foreign government appropriations for defense and space programs and by compliance risks. Results may also be impacted by the potential introduction of counterfeit parts into our global supply chain.\n- Industrial Automation -Operating results may be adversely impacted by reduced investments in process automation, safety monitoring, and plant capacity utiliz ation initiativ es, fluctuations in retail markets, a slowdown in demand for safety products, changes in the competitive landscape, including new market entrants and new technologies that may lead to product commoditization, and adverse industry economic conditions, all of which could result in lower market share, reduced selling prices, and lower margins.\n- Building Automation -Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global buildings and infrastructure construction activity (including retrofits and upgrades), lower capital spending and operating expenditures on projects, changes in the competitive landscape, including new market entrants and new technologies, and fluctuations in inventory levels in distribution channels.\n- Energy and Sustainability Solutions -Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical, and semiconductor plants, our customers' availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, raw material demand and supply , product  commoditization,  continued  illegal  imports  of  hydrofluorocarbons  into  Europe,  and  our  ability  to  maximize  our  facilities'  production  capacity  and minimize downtime. Periods of increased volatility in oil and natural gas prices may result in less investment by our customers and therefore, lower demand for our products and services.\n\nA significant percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory , foreign exchange, and other risks of international operations.\n\nOur international operations, including U.S. exports, represent more than half of the Company's sales. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, antitrust regulations, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export, and other trade restrictions and barriers (such as tariffs, sanctions, and embargoes), differing levels of protection of intellectual property , acts of  industrial  espionage,  violations  by  our  employees  of  anti-corruption  laws  (despite  our  efforts  to  mitigate  such  risk),  changes  in  regulations  regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, acts of terrorism, acts of war, civil strife, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. Instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment and the evolving international and domestic political, regulatory , and economic landscape, including the potential for changes in global trade policies, such as sanctions and trade barriers,  and  trends  such  as  populism,  economic  nationalism,  and  negative  sentiment  toward  multinational  companies,  as  well  as  the  cost  of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide, can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing, or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins.\n\nExisting free trade laws and regulations provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs, or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products or from where we import products or raw materials, either directly or through our suppliers, could have an impact on our competitive position and financial results.\n\n28 Honeywell International Inc.",

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nINTEREST RATES. While we currently have market risk sensitive instruments related to interest rates, we do not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on our long-term debt. As disclosed in Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we had outstanding fixed-rate long-term debt (exclusive of finance leases) with an estimated fair value of $17.5 billion at May 31, 2024 and outstanding fix ed-rate long-term debt (ex clusive of finance leases) with an estimated fair value of $17.5 billion at May 31, 2023. Market risk for long-term debt is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates and amounts to approximately $650 million as of May 31, 2024 and approximately $750 million as of May 31, 2023. The underlying fair values of our long-term debt were estimated based on quoted market prices or on the current rates offered for debt with similar terms and maturities.\n\nWe have interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations. Changes in interest rates impact our liabilities associated with these retirement plans, as well as the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized. Declines in the value of plan assets could diminish the funded status of our pension plans and potentially increase our requirement to make contributions to the plans. Substantial investment losses on plan assets would also increase net pension expense. See the 'Critical Accounting Estimates - Retirement Plans' section of 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition' of this Annual Report for more information.\n\nFOREIGN CURRENCY. While we are a global provider of transportation, e-commerce, and business services, the majority of our transactions during the periods presented in this Annual Report are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed are in the euro, Chinese yuan, British pound, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Mexican peso, Hong Kong dollar, and Japanese yen. Historically, our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is more significant with respect to our revenue than our expenses, as a significant portion of our ex penses are denominated in U.S. dollars, such as aircraft and fuel ex penses. Foreign currency fluctuations had a slightly negative impact on operating income in 2024 and a slightly negative impact on operating income in 2023. However, favorable foreign currency fluctuations also may have had an offsetting impact on the price we obtained or the demand for our services, which is not quantifiable. At May 31, 2024, the result of a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease in expected operating income of approximately $400 million for 2025. This theoretical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar, which is not consistent with our actual ex perience in foreign currency transactions. In addition to the direct effects of changes in ex change rates, fluctuations in ex change rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors' services become more or less attractive. The sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices.\n\nWe maintain derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency fluctuations related to probable future transactions and cash flows denominated in currencies other than the currency of the transacting entity, which impacts our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. Certain derivatives are designated as net investment hedges and the gains or losses on those derivatives are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common stockholders' investment as part of the cumulative translation adjustment. During 2024, we recognized a $6 million loss in other comprehensive income related to our cross-currency swaps, which excludes any impact of deferred income taxes. All other derivatives are accounted for at fair value with any gains or losses recorded in income, and were immaterial in 2024. The income statement impact of the derivatives was immaterial in 2023. For additional discussion of our derivatives, see Note 15 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\nCOMMODITY. While we have market risk for changes in the price of jet and vehicle fuel, this risk is largely mitigated by our index ed fuel surcharges. For additional discussion of our indexed fuel surcharges, see the 'Results of Operations and Outlook - Consolidated Results - Fuel' section of 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.'",

FedEx has stated that its compliance costs under these programs will depend in part on its ability to utilize sustainable aviation fuels and the price of such fuels.

          "chunk_text": "DOT's approval and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the U.S. and the foreign government. In addition, the carrier must then be granted the permission of such foreign government to provide specific flights and services. The regulatory environment for global aviation rights may from time to time impair the ability of Federal Ex press to operate its air network in the most efficient manner, and efficient operations often utilize open skies provisions of aviation agreements. Additionally, global air cargo carriers, such as Federal Ex press, are subject to current and potential additional aviation security regulation by U.S. and foreign governments.\n\nOur operations outside of the U.S., such as Federal Express's international domestic operations, are also subject to current and potential regulations, including certain postal regulations and licensing requirements, that restrict, make difficult, and sometimes prohibit, the ability of foreign-owned companies such as Federal Express to compete effectively in parts of the international domestic transportation and logistics market.\n\n## Environmental .\n\nNoise : Pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act, the FAA, with the assistance of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ('EPA'), is authorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise. Federal Express's aircraft fleet is in compliance with current FAA noise standards. Although the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 established a National Noise Policy that enables certain airport operators to implement noise abatement programs, it created an opportunity for Federal Express to plan for noise reduction and better respond to local noise constraints. Additionally, certain U.S. airport operators have implemented local noise regulations, and certain foreign jurisdictions impose noise-based limitations on airline operations. Neither the National Noise Policy nor any domestic or foreign local noise regulations have a material effect in any of Federal Ex press's significant markets.\n\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions : Concern over climate change, including the effect of global warming, has led to significant U.S. and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas ('GHG') emissions, including our aircraft and vehicle engine emissions. Increasingly, state and local governments are also considering GHG regulatory requirements. Compliance with such regulation and the associated potential cost is complicated by the fact that various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of climate change. In 2016, the International Civil Aviation Organization ('ICAO') formally adopted a global, market-based emissions offset program known as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation ('CORSIA'). This program established a goal for the aviation industry to achieve carbon neutral growth in international aviation beginning in calendar 2021. Any growth above a global industry emissions baseline would need to be addressed using either eligible carbon offset credits or qualifying sustainable aviation fuel purchases. The baseline was originally set as an average of calendar 2019 and calendar 2020 emissions. In 2023, due to the effects of COVID-19 on the airline industry, the ICAO adopted a new baseline of 85% of calendar 2019 emissions. The U.S. has not fully implemented CORSIA to date. In the interim, we continue to voluntarily report our emissions data to the FAA.\n\nOther ICAO member states are moving forward with implementing CORSIA and have taken additional action to reduce aircraft GHG emissions. For example, both the EU and the United Kingdom have implemented regulations to include aviation in the Emissions Trading Scheme ('ETS'). For the EU, under these regulations any airline with flights originating or landing in the European Economic Area ('EEA') is subject to the ETS. Beginning in calendar 2012, airlines including Federal Express were required to purchase emissions allowances or, alternatively, purchase qualifying sustainable aviation fuel if they exceeded the number of free allowances allocated under the ETS. While the current scope of ETS has been limited to apply only to flights within the EEA through calendar 2026, the EU adopted legislation in 2023 requiring that a study be conducted in July 2026 reassessing whether the European Commission should propose to expand the scope of ETS to include international flights from the EEA based on CORSIA implementation and performance.\n\nWe expect compliance with CORSIA and the ETS to increase FedEx operating expenses. The amount of such increase will ultimately depend on a number of factors, including the number of our flights subject to CORSIA and the ETS, the fuel efficiency of our fleet, the average growth of the aviation sector, our ability to utilize sustainable aviation fuels in the future and the price of such fuels, the availability of free allowances (which will be eliminated entirely by the end of calendar 2026), and the price of eligible emission units, offsets, or allowances required to be purchased by FedEx.\n\nAdditionally, in 2017, ICAO adopted new carbon dioxide emissions standards that would apply not only to new aircraft types as of calendar 2020, but also to new deliveries of currently in-production aircraft types from calendar 2023. ICAO established a production cutoff date of January 1, 2028 for aircraft that do not comply with these standards. The standards are considered to be especially stringent for larger aircraft weighing over 60 tons. In 2021, the EPA adopted its own aircraft and aircraft engine GHG emissions standards, which are aligned with the 2017 ICAO emissions standards, and the FAA finalized its own conforming rulemaking to implement the standards through its aircraft certification process which went into effect on April 16, 2024. In the past, the U.S. Congress has also considered bills that would regulate GHG emissions, and some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future. In 2021 the U.S. reentered the Paris climate accord, an agreement among 197 countries to reduce GHG emissions. The effect of the reentry on future U.S. policy regarding GHG emissions and on other GHG regulation is uncertain.",

Additionally, shifts in weather patterns caused by climate change could increase the frequency, severity, or duration of certain adverse weather conditions. We may experience reduced availability and/or increases in the cost of insurance due to such changes. Prolonged interruptions or disruptions at a key location such as our FedEx Memphis World Hub or one of our information-technology centers could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We also may incur significant costs to reestablish or relocate these functions. Moreover, resulting economic dislocations, including supply chain and fuel disruptions, could adversely affect demand for our services resulting in an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\n## Other Legal, Regulatory, and Miscellaneous Risks\n\nGovernment regulation and enforcement are evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business. We are subject to regulation under a wide variety of U.S. federal, state, and local and non-U.S. government regulations, laws, policies, and actions. There can be no assurance that such regulations, laws, policies, and actions will not be changed in ways that will decrease the demand for our services, subject us to escalating costs, or require us to modify our business models and objectives (such as our DRIVE transformation program, including Network 2.0), harming our financial results. In particular, legislative, regulatory, or other actions that U.S. and non-U.S. governments have undertaken or could take in areas such as data privacy and sovereignty, the use of artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies, taxes, foreign ex change intervention in response to currency volatility, currency controls that could restrict the movement of liquidity from particular jurisdictions, trade controls, tariffs, quotas, embargoes, or sanctions in the U.S. or other countries, complex  economic sanctions, import and ex port controls, customs standards, additional security or workplace and transportation health and safety requirements, labor and employment standards (including with respect to our pilots), worker classification, joint employment and benefits, government contracting, antitrust, regulated commodities, environmental, climate-related, or emission standards, and accounting may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, effective tax rate, and service levels. Furthermore, some of our operations are in high-risk legal compliance environments, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the 'FCPA'), similar anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions, and other compliance-related laws or regulations could result in litigation, assessment of damages, imposition of penalties, or other consequences. For additional discussion, see 'Item 1. Business' of this Annual Report under the caption 'Regulation.' Additionally, in light of the recently held and upcoming elections in the U.S. and various international jurisdictions, there is considerable uncertainty regarding reforms of various aspects of ex isting laws, regulations, and enforcement priorities and strategies that could affect trade policies, labor matters, tax es, and technological advancements, among other areas, and have a material effect on our business and results of operations, as well as on the price of our common stock.\n\nWe could be subject to adverse changes in regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions. We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, changes in tax  laws or regulations may be enacted that could significantly affect our overall tax  liabilities and our effective tax rate. U.S. and foreign governmental agencies maintain focus on the taxation of multinational companies, including statutory tax rates, digital tax es, global minimum taxes (such as the framework agreed to by members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development), and transactions between affiliated companies. Such changes may require new and complex computations to be performed, significant judgments, estimates, and calculations to be made, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced.\n\nStandard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of certain tax laws and regulations will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation, and we may be required to make adjustments to amounts that we have recorded that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. See 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition-Results of Operations and Outlook -Consolidated Results-Income Taxes' of this Annual Report for additional information regarding ongoing tax examinations and challenges. Additionally, see 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition-Critical Accounting Estimates-Income Taxes' of this Annual Report for information regarding estimates and potential adjustments related to our tax positions.\n\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding data protection. There has recently been heightened regulatory and enforcement focus relating to the collection, use, retention, transfer, and processing of personal data in the U.S. (at both the state and federal level) and internationally, including the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, the California Privacy Rights Act, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, and other similar laws that have been or will be enacted by other jurisdictions. In addition, in the U.S. and internationally, there has been increased legislative and regulatory activity related to artificial intelligence and the risks and challenges artificial intelligence poses, including the European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act and the current U.S. presidential administration's ex ecutive order to, among other things, establish artificial intelligence safety and security. Also, China and certain other jurisdictions have enacted more stringent data localization requirements. An actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable U.S. or foreign data protection laws, regulations, or other data protection standards may expose us to litigation (including, in some instances, class action litigation), fines, sanctions, or other penalties, which",

      "answer": "FedEx accounts for spare parts obsolescence by providing allowances for excess or obsolete parts identified currently and those expected to be on hand when aircraft are retired. These allowances are expensed over the estimated useful life of the related aircraft and engines. This policy indicates that FedEx spreads out the financial impact of spare parts obsolescence over time rather than absorbing it all at once. Meanwhile, Honeywell provides spare parts and maintenance services for aircraft operators, including repair, overhaul, and predictive maintenance solutions through Honeywell Forge. Since FedEx is an aircraft operator, it may rely on suppliers like Honeywell for spare parts and maintenance services. FedEx's cost structure is influenced by its internal accounting for spare parts obsolescence, while Honeywell's Aerospace Technologies segment generates revenue by supplying these parts and services externally. This creates a complementary relationship where FedEx manages long-term spare parts costs through allowances, while Honeywell monetizes its spare parts and service capabilities.",

Cash in excess of current operating requirements is invested in short-term, interest-bearing instruments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase and is stated at cost, which approximates market value.\n\nSPARE PARTS, SUPPLIES, AND FUEL. Spare parts (principally aircraft-related) are reported at weighted-average cost. Allowances for obsolescence are provided for spare parts currently identified as ex cess or obsolete as well as ex pected to be on hand at the date the aircraft are retired from service. These allowances are provided over the estimated useful life of the related aircraft and engines. The majority of our supplies and fuel are reported at weighted-average cost.\n\nPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT . Ex penditures for major additions, improvements, and flight equipment modifications are capitalized when such costs are determined to extend the useful life of the asset or are part of the cost of acquiring the asset. Ex penditures for equipment overhaul costs of engines or airframes prior to their operational use are capitalized as part of the cost of such assets as they are costs required to ready the asset for its intended use. Maintenance and repairs costs are charged to expense as incurred, except for certain aircraft engine maintenance costs incurred under third-party service agreements. These agreements result in costs being expensed based on cycles or hours flown and are subject to annual escalation. These service contracts transfer risk to third-party service providers and generally fix  the amount we pay for maintenance to the service provider as a rate per cycle or flight hour, in ex change for maintenance and repairs under a predefined maintenance program. We capitalize certain direct internal and external costs associated with the development of internal-use software, including implementation of cloud computing service arrangements. Gains and losses on sales of property used in operations are classified within operating expenses and historically have been nominal.\n\nFor financial reporting purposes, we record depreciation and amortization of property and equipment on a straight-line basis over the asset's service life or related lease term, if shorter. For income tax  purposes, depreciation is computed using accelerated methods when applicable.\n\nThe depreciable lives and net book value of our property and equipment are as follows (dollars in millions):\n\n",

      "answer": "The Railway Labor Act (RLA) imposes a mandatory government-led mediation process supervised by the National Mediation Board before a union can strike or an employer can replace employees or impose contract terms. This process helps minimize the risk of strikes that would shut down large portions of the economy and contributes to labor cost stability at FedEx Express by preventing localized labor disputes from disrupting the entire air/ground network. In contrast, Union Pacific Railroad has pending lawsuits related to the enforceability of an Executive Order (EO) that are currently stayed, pending a final court decision on the EO's enforceability. Until this legal matter is resolved, the potential impact of the EO on Union Pacific's labor processes governed by the RLA remains uncertain, which could introduce variability in labor costs or operational continuity depending on the court's final ruling.",

          "chunk_text": "Labor . All U.S. employees at FedEx Express are covered by the Railway Labor Act of 1926, as amended (the 'RLA'), while labor relations within the U.S. at our other companies are governed by the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, as amended (the 'NLRA'). Under the RLA, groups that wish to unionize must do so across nationwide classes of employees. The RLA also requires mandatory government-led mediation of contract disputes supervised by the National Mediation Board before a union can strike or an employer can replace employees or impose contract terms. This part of the RLA helps minimize the risk of strikes that would shut down large portions of the economy. Under the NLRA, employees can unionize in small localized groups, and government-led mediation is not a required step in the negotiation process.\n\nThe RLA was originally passed to govern railroad and express carrier labor negotiations. As transportation systems evolved, the law expanded to cover airlines, which are the dominant national transportation systems of today. As an air express carrier with an integrated air/ground network, FedEx Express and its employees have been covered by the RLA since the founding of the company. The purpose of the RLA is to offer employees a process by which to unionize (if they choose) and engage in collective bargaining while also protecting global commerce from damaging work stoppages and delays. Specifically, the RLA ensures that an entire transportation system, such as at FedEx Express, cannot be shut down by the actions of a local segment of the network.\n\nThe U.S. Congress has, in the past, considered adopting changes in labor laws that would make it easier for unions to organize units of our employees. For example, there is always a possibility that Congress could remove most FedEx Express employees from the jurisdiction of the RLA, thereby exposing the FedEx Express network to sporadic labor disputes and the risk that small groups of employees could disrupt the entire air/ground network. In addition, federal and state governmental agencies, such as the National Mediation Board and the National Labor Relations Board ('NLRB'), have and may continue to take actions that could make it easier for our employees, and employees of service providers contracting with FedEx Ground, to organize under the RLA or NLRA. For a description of these and other potential labor law changes, see 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' of this Annual Report.\n\nData Protection . There has recently been heightened regulatory and enforcement focus relating to the collection, use, retention, transfer, and processing of personal data in the U.S. (at both the state and federal level) and internationally.

      "answer": "FedEx is subject to CORSIA, a global market-based program aimed at offsetting carbon dioxide emissions for international aviation, which is expected to increase FedEx's operating expenses. The magnitude of this increase depends on factors such as the number of flights subject to CORSIA, fleet fuel efficiency, and the price of ICAO-eligible emission units. Additionally, FedEx faces potential compliance costs due to EPA adoption of ICAO emissions standards for aircraft engines and the uncertainty surrounding U.S. policy on GHG emissions following reentry into the Paris climate accord. In contrast, Union Pacific is not exposed to international aviation emissions regulations but emphasizes its environmental stewardship through fuel-efficient transportation and initiatives outlined in its Climate Action Plan, which aim to reduce emissions further. While rail transport is inherently more fuel-efficient\u2014reducing GHG emissions by up to 75% compared to trucking\u2014Union Pacific still faces compliance costs related to DOT and other federal regulations governing emissions, hazardous materials, and equipment standards. Both companies are influenced by DOT regulations, but FedEx faces more direct cost implications due to its international aviation operations, while Union Pacific leverages rail's inherent efficiency to align with domestic environmental expectations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [

          "chunk_text": "In 2016, the International Civil Aviation Organization ('ICAO') passed a resolution adopting CORSIA, which is a global, marketbased measure for purchasing credits to offset carbon dioxide emissions and intended to aid in meeting the ICAO's goal of carbon neutral growth starting in calendar 2020 by complementing industry efforts in infrastructure upgrades, technology, operations, and sustainable aviation fuel. In June 2018, the ICAO adopted standards pertaining to country-by-country implementation including the collection and reporting of information on international aviation emissions beginning in calendar 2019. In furtherance of these efforts, in 2019 the FAA issued notice of a CORSIA program enabling U.S. carriers to submit emissions data used to set the initial global industry emissions baseline. Beginning in calendar 2021, requirements commenced for carriers subject to CORSIA to offset international aviation emissions above the industry baseline by purchasing and retiring eligible carbon credits and/or utilizing sustainable aviation fuel. In response to the creation of the CORSIA program, in December 2017, the EU adopted a proposal that indefinitely excludes from the ETS flights operating fully or partly outside the EU and gradually reduces the number of aviation allowances from calendar 2021. The EU has indicated that it will assess CORSIA implementation and determine the future status of the ETS as applied to international aviation to and from the EEA. We expect compliance with CORSIA to increase FedEx operating expenses. The amount of such increase will ultimately depend on a number of factors, including the number of our flights subject to CORSIA, the fuel efficiency of our fleet, the average growth of the aviation sector, our ability to utilize sustainable aviation fuels in the future, and the price of ICAO-eligible emission units or offsets required to be purchased by FedEx.\n\nAdditionally, in calendar 2016, the EPA issued a finding that aircraft engine GHG emissions cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. In 2017, ICAO adopted new carbon dioxide emissions standards that would apply not only to new aircraft types as of calendar 2020, but also to new deliveries of current in-production aircraft types from calendar 2023. Additionally, a cutoff date of calendar 2028 for production of aircraft that do not comply with proposed standards was adopted. These standards are considered to be especially stringent for larger aircraft weighing over 60 tons. In 2021, the EPA adopted its own aircraft and aircraft engine GHG emissions standards, which are aligned with the 2017 ICAO emissions standards. In the past, the U.S. Congress has also considered bills that would regulate GHG emissions, and some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future. In 2021 the U.S. reentered the Paris climate accord, an agreement among 197 countries to reduce GHG emissions. The effect of the reentry on future U.S. policy regarding GHG emissions and on other GHG regulation is uncertain. Additionally, the extent to which other countries implement that agreement could have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business.\n\nWe are also subject to international, federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations relating to, among other things, the shipment of dangerous goods and contingency planning for spills of petroleum products. Additionally, we are subject to numerous regulations dealing with underground fuel storage tanks, hazardous waste handling, vehicle and equipment emissions and noise, and the discharge of effluents from our properties and equipment. FedEx Express has an environmental management system based on International Standardization 14001 designed to maintain compliance with these regulations and minimize our operational environmental footprint.\n\nExport Controls . In recent years, the U.S. government has increased the number of companies and persons subject to U.S. export control regulations. Such regulations can restrict the types of items that FedEx customers are permitted to ship to certain entities, and in some instances may prohibit FedEx from serving certain entities altogether. Violations of these regulations can result in significant monetary and other penalties. For example, the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (the 'ECRA') and its implementing regulations, the Export Administration Regulations (the 'EARs'), hold carriers such as FedEx strictly liable for shipments that may violate the EARs without requiring evidence that the carriers had knowledge of any violations. Violations of the ECRA can result in criminal penalties of up to $1 million and civil penalties of $305,000 (or twice the value of the transaction) per individual violation. FedEx is investing in improvements and updates to its export control compliance programs. However, the heightened focus on export controls by the U.S. government increases FedEx's exposure to potential regulatory penalties and could result in higher compliance costs.\n\nIn June 2019 FedEx filed suit in U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia seeking to enjoin the U.S. Department of Commerce (the 'DOC') from enforcing prohibitions contained in the EARs against FedEx. FedEx believes that the EARs violate common carriers' rights to due process under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution as they unreasonably hold common carriers strictly liable for shipments that may violate the EARs without requiring evidence that the carriers had knowledge of any violations. In September 2020 the court granted the DOC's motion to dismiss the lawsuit. In November 2020 we appealed this decision. On July 8, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the lawsuit.\n\nCustoms . Our activities, including customs brokerage and freight forwarding, are subject to regulation by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the TSA within the Department of Homeland Security (customs brokerage and security issues), the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission (ocean freight forwarding), and the DOT (air freight forwarding). Our offshore operations are subject to similar regulation by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions.",

          "chunk_text": "In 2016, the International Civil Aviation Organization ('ICAO') passed a resolution adopting CORSIA, which is a global, marketbased measure for purchasing credits to offset carbon dioxide emissions and intended to aid in meeting the ICAO's goal of carbon neutral growth starting in calendar 2020 by complementing industry efforts in infrastructure upgrades, technology, operations, and sustainable aviation fuel. In June 2018, the ICAO adopted standards pertaining to country-by-country implementation including the collection and reporting of information on international aviation emissions beginning in calendar 2019. In furtherance of these efforts, in 2019 the FAA issued notice of a CORSIA program enabling U.S. carriers to submit emissions data used to set the initial global industry emissions baseline. Beginning in calendar 2021, requirements commenced for carriers subject to CORSIA to offset international aviation emissions above the industry baseline by purchasing and retiring eligible carbon credits and/or utilizing sustainable aviation fuel. In response to the creation of the CORSIA program, in December 2017, the EU adopted a proposal that indefinitely excludes from the ETS flights operating fully or partly outside the EU and gradually reduces the number of aviation allowances from calendar 2021. The EU has indicated that it will assess CORSIA implementation and determine the future status of the ETS as applied to international aviation to and from the EEA. We expect compliance with CORSIA to increase FedEx operating expenses. The amount of such increase will ultimately depend on a number of factors, including the number of our flights subject to CORSIA, the fuel efficiency of our fleet, the average growth of the aviation sector, our ability to utilize sustainable aviation fuels in the future, and the price of ICAO-eligible emission units or offsets required to be purchased by FedEx.\n\nAdditionally, in calendar 2016, the EPA issued a finding that aircraft engine GHG emissions cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. In 2017, ICAO adopted new carbon dioxide emissions standards that would apply not only to new aircraft types as of calendar 2020, but also to new deliveries of current in-production aircraft types from calendar 2023. Additionally, a cutoff date of calendar 2028 for production of aircraft that do not comply with proposed standards was adopted. These standards are considered to be especially stringent for larger aircraft weighing over 60 tons. In 2021, the EPA adopted its own aircraft and aircraft engine GHG emissions standards, which are aligned with the 2017 ICAO emissions standards. In the past, the U.S. Congress has also considered bills that would regulate GHG emissions, and some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future. In 2021 the U.S. reentered the Paris climate accord, an agreement among 197 countries to reduce GHG emissions. The effect of the reentry on future U.S. policy regarding GHG emissions and on other GHG regulation is uncertain. Additionally, the extent to which other countries implement that agreement could have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business.\n\nWe are also subject to international, federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations relating to, among other things, the shipment of dangerous goods and contingency planning for spills of petroleum products. Additionally, we are subject to numerous regulations dealing with underground fuel storage tanks, hazardous waste handling, vehicle and equipment emissions and noise, and the discharge of effluents from our properties and equipment. FedEx Express has an environmental management system based on International Standardization 14001 designed to maintain compliance with these regulations and minimize our operational environmental footprint.\n\nExport Controls . In recent years, the U.S. government has increased the number of companies and persons subject to U.S. export control regulations. Such regulations can restrict the types of items that FedEx customers are permitted to ship to certain entities, and in some instances may prohibit FedEx from serving certain entities altogether. Violations of these regulations can result in significant monetary and other penalties. For example, the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (the 'ECRA') and its implementing regulations, the Export Administration Regulations (the 'EARs'), hold carriers such as FedEx strictly liable for shipments that may violate the EARs without requiring evidence that the carriers had knowledge of any violations. Violations of the ECRA can result in criminal penalties of up to $1 million and civil penalties of $305,000 (or twice the value of the transaction) per individual violation. FedEx is investing in improvements and updates to its export control compliance programs. However, the heightened focus on export controls by the U.S. government increases FedEx's exposure to potential regulatory penalties and could result in higher compliance costs.\n\nIn June 2019 FedEx filed suit in U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia seeking to enjoin the U.S. Department of Commerce (the 'DOC') from enforcing prohibitions contained in the EARs against FedEx. FedEx believes that the EARs violate common carriers' rights to due process under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution as they unreasonably hold common carriers strictly liable for shipments that may violate the EARs without requiring evidence that the carriers had knowledge of any violations. In September 2020 the court granted the DOC's motion to dismiss the lawsuit. In November 2020 we appealed this decision. On July 8, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the lawsuit.\n\nCustoms . Our activities, including customs brokerage and freight forwarding, are subject to regulation by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the TSA within the Department of Homeland Security (customs brokerage and security issues), the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission (ocean freight forwarding), and the DOT (air freight forwarding). Our offshore operations are subject to similar regulation by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions.",

We cannot fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claims on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. To the extent possible, we have recorded a liability where asserted and unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably estimated. We do not expect that any known lawsuits, claims, environmental costs, commitments, contingent liabilities, or guarantees will have a material  adverse  effect  on  our  consolidated  results  of  operations,  financial  condition,  or  liquidity  after  taking  into account liabilities and insurance recoveries previously recorded for these matters.\n\nPersonal Injury - The Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA) governs compensation for work-related accidents. Under FELA, damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or out-of-court settlements. We offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work.\n\nApproximately  94%  of  the  recorded  liability  is  related  to  asserted  claims  and  approximately  6%  is  related  to unasserted claims at December 31, 2021. Because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury  claims,  it  is  reasonably  possible  that  future  costs  to  settle  these  claims  may  range  from  approximately $325 million to $358 million. We record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other. Estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation.",

      "answer": "Boeing disclosed $160 million in potential termination liabilities to suppliers related to unauthorized future missions, indicating a significant exposure tied to unfulfilled contractual obligations. Caterpillar, on the other hand, reported a much smaller liability of $3 million for dealer performance guarantees at the end of 2023, with no payments made under these guarantees. While Boeing's exposure is tied to off-balance sheet arrangements with potentially higher financial impact, Caterpillar's risk appears more contained and historical in nature. This suggests Boeing faces a more immediate and quantifiable financial risk from its third-party guarantees compared to Caterpillar.",

      "question": "How does the recognition of revenue over time for long-term contracts, as described by BA, contrast with CAT's approach to recognizing revenue for Machinery, Energy & Transportation (ME&T) sales, particularly in terms of when control transfers to the customer?",
      "answer": "BA recognizes revenue over the contract term as work progresses for long-term contracts, based on a continuous transfer of control to the customer, which is supported by clauses allowing the customer to terminate the contract and take control of work in process. In contrast, CAT recognizes ME&T sales revenue only after specific criteria are met, including the completion of its performance obligation where the customer has obtained control of the product, typically at the point of shipment or border crossing for exports. This indicates that BA adopts a progressive revenue recognition model tied to performance obligations and work completion percentages, while CAT follows a point-in-time model based on transfer of control and fulfillment of contractual conditions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - BA recognizes revenue over time as work progresses on long-term contracts due to continuous transfer of control, supported by contractual clauses allowing customer termination and control of work in process.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - CAT recognizes revenue for ME&T sales only after completion of its performance obligation where the customer has obtained control of the product, typically upon shipment or at the destination country's border for exports.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The contrast lies in the timing and mechanism of revenue recognition: BA uses a continuous over-time model based on performance obligations and customer control of work in process, while CAT uses a point-in-time model triggered by the transfer of control at shipment or delivery."

      "answer": "3M disclosed contingent tax liabilities related to its 2022 split-off of the Food Safety Division using a Reverse Morris Trust structure, which was intended to be tax-free. If this transaction were later determined to fail tax-free treatment, 3M could face significant liabilities that could materially impact its business and financial condition. Raytheon, on the other hand, disclosed contingent tax liabilities related to the 2020 distributions of Carrier and Otis, along with associated internal separation transactions, which were also intended to be tax-free. If these distributions or related transactions failed to qualify for tax-free treatment, Raytheon could face significant tax liabilities with material adverse impacts on its financial condition and operations. The key difference lies in the nature of the transactions\u20143M's contingent liability stems from a Reverse Morris Trust split-off, while Raytheon's arises from spin-off distributions of major subsidiaries.",

      "question": "How does the potential failure to achieve tax-free treatment for MMM's planned spin-off of its Health Care business compare with RTX's successful tax-free treatment of its Carrier and Otis dispositions, and what are the respective financial implications for each company?",
      "answer": "MMM's planned spin-off of its Health Care business is conditional on receiving a private letter ruling from the IRS and a tax opinion from external counsel to ensure tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the spin-off is determined to be taxable, MMM could incur significant income tax liabilities that could negatively impact its financial condition and results of operations. In contrast, RTX successfully determined that its distributions of Carrier and Otis on April 3, 2020, and related internal separation transactions qualified as tax-free under applicable law, based on tax rulings and external advice. If those distributions had failed to qualify for tax-free treatment, RTX could also have faced significant tax liabilities. However, unlike MMM, RTX has already confirmed the tax-free treatment of its dispositions, whereas MMM's tax treatment remains uncertain and subject to future conditions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - MMM's spin-off is intended to be tax-free but is conditional on IRS ruling and tax opinion, and failure could result in significant tax liabilities.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - RTX determined that its Carrier and Otis dispositions qualified as tax-free under applicable law, based on tax rulings and external advice.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are subject to tax treatment conditions for business separation transactions, but RTX has already confirmed tax-free status, while MMM's remains uncertain, leading to differing financial risks."

      "question": "How does the difference in the outcomes of the 2023 annual goodwill impairment testing between 3M and RTX reflect contrasting financial implications for each company's reporting units, and what specific goodwill-related actions did each company take during the year?",
      "answer": "3M had a $12.9 billion goodwill balance as of December 31, 2023, and although its annual goodwill impairment testing completed as of October 1, 2023, indicated no impairment for most reporting units, it did record a goodwill impairment charge related to the Advanced Materials reporting unit due to its commitment to exit PFAS manufacturing. In contrast, RTX completed its 2023 annual goodwill impairment testing as of October 1 and determined that no adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill were necessary, with all reporting units passing the qualitative assessment. Additionally, RTX restructured its business segments and reassigned goodwill on a relative fair value basis without any impairment. Thus, while 3M faced a specific impairment charge tied to its Advanced Materials unit, RTX experienced no impairment and only internal reallocation of goodwill.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - 3M had $12.9 billion in goodwill as of December 31, 2023, and recorded a goodwill impairment charge related to the Advanced Materials reporting unit due to its exit from PFAS manufacturing.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - RTX completed its annual goodwill impairment testing as of October 1, 2023, and determined that no adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill were necessary, even after restructuring its business segments and reassigning goodwill.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The contrast between 3M\u2019s impairment charge for Advanced Materials and RTX\u2019s lack of impairment despite internal restructuring highlights different financial impacts from their 2023 goodwill impairment testing outcomes."

      "answer": "The Railway Labor Act (RLA) imposes a mandatory mediation process through the National Mediation Board before any union can strike or employer can impose terms, which reduces the risk of sudden work stoppages for both companies. At Federal Express, all U.S. employees are subject to the RLA, requiring unionization to occur across nationwide employee classes, which centralizes labor disputes and prevents localized disruptions from shutting down the integrated air/ground network. In contrast, Union Pacific has approximately 85% of its 32,973 employees represented by rail unions under the RLA, with the next round of negotiations beginning in 2025. The RLA\u2019s mediation process similarly delays strikes or lockouts at Union Pacific, but the company\u2019s larger and more unionized workforce could mean more complex and prolonged negotiations, potentially increasing labor risk exposure if mediation fails. Thus, while the RLA reduces immediate disruption risk for both companies, the scale and union composition at Union Pacific may present a more nuanced labor risk profile.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Federal Express requires nationwide unionization under the RLA, with mandatory mediation before strikes, preventing localized disruptions.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Union Pacific has 85% of its 32,973 employees represented by unions under the RLA, with negotiations starting in 2025.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are protected by the RLA\u2019s mediation process, but Federal Express's structure centralizes labor risk nationally, whereas Union Pacific faces more concentrated union power with a larger workforce, potentially complicating mediation outcomes."

      "answer": "FDX adjusts estimated service lives for its capital assets, particularly aircraft, which account for approximately 60% of its owned assets. Changes in service life estimates directly affect depreciation expense over 18- to 30-year periods, impacting financial reporting. UNP monitors estimated service lives for rail assets in high-density traffic corridors measured in millions of gross tons per mile, recalculating depreciation rates annually based on usage. With $2.5 billion in 2023 maintenance expense, UNP capitalizes costs that extend asset life or improve safety, while expensing regular maintenance.

      "answer": "GE held $0.4 billion in cash in countries with currency control restrictions, which limits its ability to transfer funds to the U.S. without incurring substantial costs. In contrast, Honeywell disclosed that it does not have material amounts of cash in jurisdictions with currency control restrictions that would impact its ability to access and repatriate funds. This difference suggests that GE must consider additional costs and regulatory hurdles in its liquidity planning for international cash, while Honeywell can more freely utilize its $8.0 billion in non-U.S. cash without such constraints, allowing for a more integrated global liquidity strategy.",

Cash held in countries with currency controls represents amounts held in countries that may restrict the transfer of funds to the U.S. or limit our ability to transfer funds to the U.S. without incurring substantial costs. Excluded from cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was $0.9 billion of cash in our run-off insurance operations, which was classified as All other assets in the Statement of Financial Position.\n\nAs part of the spin-off of GE HealthCare completed in the first quarter of 2023, we retained 19.9% stake of GE HealthCare common stock upon the spin. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we sold all of our remaining GE Healthcare shares and received total proceeds of $5.2 billion from the disposition of 61.6 million shares. See Notes 3 and 19 for further information.\n\nFollowing approval of a statutory permitted accounting practice in 2018 by our primary insurance regulator, the Kansas Insurance Department (KID), we have since provided a total of $15.0 billion of capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries, including the final contribution of $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2024. See Note 12 for further information.\n\nOn March 7, 2024, the Company announced that the Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $15.0 billion of our common stock, which replaced our previous $3.0 billion share repurchase authorization. Under this program, shares may be repurchased on the open market, via various strategies, including plans complying with rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 as well as plans using accelerated share repurchases. In connection with this new authorization, we repurchased 28.8 million shares for $4.9 billion from A pril 2024 through December 31, 2024. This included repurchases of 12.5 million shares for $2.2 billion using accelerated stock repurchases, which were utilized as a mechanism to achieve planned repurchase volumes within a quarter during closed windows.\n\nBORROWINGS. Consolidated total borrowings were $19.3 billion and $20.5 billion at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, a decrease of $1.2 billion, mainly due to maturities. In A pril 2024, the Company replaced its previous $10.0 billion syndicated credit facility with a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility  in an aggregate committed amount of $3.0 billion. The total interest payments on consolidated borrowings are estimated to be $0.8 billion, $0.8 billion, $0.7 billion, $0.7 billion and $0.7 billion for 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028 and 2029, respectively.\n\nCREDIT RATING S AND CONDITIONS. We have relied, and may continue to rely, on the short- and long-term debt capital markets to fund, among other things, a significant portion of our operations. The cost and availability of debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings. M oody's Investors Service (M oody's) and Standard and Poor's Global Ratings (S&amp;P) currently issue ratings on our short- and long-term debt. Fitch, which previously issued ratings on us, affirmed our BBB+ long term rating and F1 short-term rating and subsequently withdrew its ratings on us on September 13, 2024, at our request. Our credit ratings as of the date of this filing are set forth in the table below.\n\n",

      "answer": "Honeywell's non-U.S. effective tax rate decreased by 5.3 percentage points in 2024, from 25.3% in 2023 to 20.0% in 2024. However, this decrease was partially offset by increased expense related to global minimum taxes. In contrast, General Electric expressed concern that regulatory measures, including global minimum taxes, could increase its cash tax costs and effective tax rate, highlighting a broader industry sensitivity to these regulatory changes. While Honeywell experienced a net decrease in its non-U.S. tax rate, the upward pressure from global minimum taxes indicates that the regulatory environment is actively affecting multinational companies' tax positions as described by GE.",

        "Step 2: From evidence_source_a, extract General Electric's concern that changes in tax laws, including global minimum taxes, could increase cash tax costs and effective tax rates.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the two perspectives: Honeywell experienced a net decrease in its non-U.S. effective tax rate in 2024, but the mention of increased expense on global minimum taxes aligns with GE\u2019s concern about the potential for such regulations to raise effective tax rates. This contrast shows how regulatory impacts can vary across firms while remaining a shared industry concern."

          "chunk_text": "outright. In particular, recent trends globally  toward increased protectionism, import and export controls, required licenses or authorizations to engage in business with certain countries or entities, the use of tariffs, restrictions on outbound investment and other trade barriers can result in actions by governments around the world that have been and may continue to be disruptive and costly to our business, and can interfere with our global operating model and weaken our competitive position. In addition, changes in environmental and climate change laws, regulations or policies (including emissions pricing and taxes, emissions standards or sustainable finance, among others) affecting the aerospace and defense sector could lead to additional costs or compliance requirements, a need for additional investment in product designs, require carbon offset investments or otherwise negatively impact our business or competitive position. Other legislative and regulatory areas of significance for our business that U.S. and non-U.S. governments have focused and continue to focus on include cybersecurity, data privacy and sovereignty, artificial intelligence, anti-corruption, competition law, public procurement law, compliance with complex trade controls and economic sanctions laws, technical regulations or local content requirements that could result in market access criteria that our products cannot or do not meet, restrictions related to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFA S), foreign exchange intervention in response to currency volatility and currency controls that could restrict the movement of liquidity  from particular jurisdictions. Potential changes to tax  laws, including changes to taxation of global income, may have an effect on our subsidiaries' structure, operations, sales, liquidity, cash flows, capital requirements, effective tax rate and performance. For example, legislative or regulatory measures by U.S. federal, state or non-U.S. governments, or rules, interpretations or audits under new or existing tax laws such as global minimum taxes or other changes to the treatment of global income, could increase our cash tax costs and effective tax rate. Regulation or government scrutiny may impact the requirements for marketing our products and slow our ability to introduce new products, resulting in an adverse impact on our business. Furthermore, we make sales to U.S. and non-U.S. governments and other public sector customers, and we participate in various governmental financing programs, that require us to comply with strict governmental regulations. As a U.S. government contractor, we are also subject to risks relating to U.S. government audits and investigations that in the past have led, and in the future may lead, to cash withholds, fines, damages or other penalties under civil or criminal laws. Inability to comply with applicable regulations could adversely affect our status with government customers or our ability to participate in projects and could have collateral consequences such as suspension or debarment. Suspension or debarment, depending on the entity involved and length of time, can limit our ability to bid for new U.S. government contracts or business with other government-related customers, and this could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nLegal proceedings - We are subject to a variety of legal proceedings, disputes, investigations and legal compliance risks, including contingent liabilities from businesses that we have exited or are inactive. We are subject to a variety of legal proceedings, commercial disputes, legal compliance risks and environmental, health and safety compliance risks in virtually every part of the world. We, our representatives and our industry are subject to continuing scrutiny by regulators, other governmental authorities and private sector entities or individuals in the U.S., the European Union and other jurisdictions, which have led or may, in certain circumstances, lead to enforcement actions, adverse changes to our business practices, fines and penalties, required remedial actions such as contaminated site clean-up or other environmental claims, or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages that could be material. For example, we remain subject to shareholder lawsuits related to the Company's financial performance, accounting and disclosure practices and related legacy matters from several years ago. These types of proceedings involving claims about past financial performance and reporting, as well as any future claims that may arise about past or current misconduct, even if unfounded, may have a significant impact on our reputation and how we are viewed by investors, customers and others. We also from time to time are involved in commercial discussions, disputes or proceedings in which, given the nature of our business that often involves large equipment and service orders and long-term commercial relationships, the claims asserted can be for significant amounts. The estimation of legal reserves or possible losses involves significant judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes inherent in litigation, disputes and investigations, and the actual losses arising from particular matters may exceed our current estimates and adversely affect our financial results. The risk management and compliance programs we have adopted and related actions that we take may not fully mitigate legal and compliance risks that we face, particularly in light of the global and div erse nature of our operations and the current enforcement environments in many jurisdictions. For example, when we investigate potential noncompliance under U.S. and non-U.S. law involving our employees, partners or third parties we work with, in some circumstances we make self-disclosures about our findings to the relevant authorities who may pursue or decline to pursue enforcement proceedings against us in connection with those matters. We are also subject to material trailing legal liabilities from businesses that we have exited or are inactive. We also expect that additional legal proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time. M oreover, we sell products and services in growth markets where claims arising from alleged violations of law, product failures or other incidents involving our products and services are adjudicated within legal systems that are less developed and less reliable than those of the U.S. or other more developed markets, and this can create additional uncertainty about the outcome of proceedings before courts or other governmental bodies in those markets. See Note 24 for further information about legal proceedings and other loss contingencies.\n\nLEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

The decrease in the non-U.S. effective tax rate was primarily attributable to changes in accruals on foreign tax matters and other foreign discrete adjustments, partially offset by increased expense on global minimum taxes.\n\nThe effective tax rate decreased by 1.3 percentage points in 2023 compared to 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to the increased benefit of taxes on non-U.S. earnings and lower expense related to unremitted withholding taxes on non-U.S. earnings, partially offset by incremental tax expense for reserves. The Company's 2023 non-U.S. effective tax rate was 25.3%, a decrease of 2.2 percentage points compared to 2022. The decrease in the non-U.S. effective tax rate was primarily attributable to increased benefit of taxes on non-U.S. earnings and lower expense related to unremitted withholding taxes on non-U.S. earnings, partially  offset by  incremental tax  ex pense for reserv es.\n\n## 73 Honeywell International Inc.",

      "question": "How do GE's revenue recognition practices for customized equipment and LMT's handling of pre-contract costs related to customer milestones influence their respective financial exposure when project timelines or contract awards deviate from expectations?",
      "answer": "GE recognizes revenue for customized goods, such as the Haliade-X contracts, over time using the percentage-of-completion method, which is sensitive to changes in cost estimates and project timelines. In 2023, GE recorded $379 million in additional project losses due to such changes. If execution timelines slip or other adverse developments occur, GE could incur further losses. Meanwhile, LMT incurs pre-contract costs in advance of contract awards to meet schedule and customer milestones, capitalizing these costs as work-in-process inventory when contract award is probable. If contracts are not awarded or milestones are missed, these costs may no longer be recoverable, increasing financial exposure. Together, both companies face financial risk from deviations in planned project timelines or contract outcomes, though they manage it through different mechanisms\u2014GE through variable revenue and loss recognition, and LMT through inventory asset exposure.",

      "question": "How do GE's and LMT's approaches to valuing Level 3 securities differ under GAAP, and what do their respective methodologies indicate about the nature of these investments in relation to their industrial operations?",
      "answer": "GE primarily values its Level 3 securities using non-binding broker quotes or other third-party sources that rely on unobservable inputs, as seen with its holdings of $379 million in U.S. corporate debt and $177 million in mortgage and asset-backed debt securities as of December 31, 2023. This suggests a reliance on opaque, less standardized valuation methods, which may reflect complex or illiquid instruments not easily priced through public markets. In contrast, LMT's Level 3 investments include $1.1 billion related to buy-in contracts as of the same date, and its trustee obtains uncorroborated quotes from brokers or investment managers when market prices are unavailable. This indicates a more structured but still subjective approach, especially for instruments not actively traded. While both companies apply Level 3 classifications under GAAP\u2014denoting the lowest priority in the fair value hierarchy\u2014their differing methodologies reflect distinct investment strategies: GE\u2019s appears more diversified across debt categories with uncertain pricing, while LMT\u2019s focuses on contractual instruments tied to retirement trust obligations, aligning with its employee benefit programs rather than core industrial operations.",

This segment includes software and analytics that are digitally enabled through Honeywell Forge, focusing on outcome-based solutions for refining/petrochemicals, life sciences, utilities, and logistics.

      "question": "How do the tax-free qualification risks described by GE and RTX differently impact their respective separation and restructuring strategies, particularly in terms of potential tax liabilities and strategic execution challenges?",
      "answer": "GE faces potential tax liabilities if the GE Vernova spin-off fails to qualify as tax-free, which could result in a significant U.S. federal income tax liability for both the company and its shareholders, as well as income tax liabilities for the new independent companies. Additionally, GE may incur non-U.S. cash taxes and non-cash tax expenses, including potential impairments of deferred tax assets. RTX, on the other hand, highlights risks related to the intended tax-free qualification of its internal restructurings and the Raytheon merger, which, if not achieved, could also result in unexpected tax liabilities. These tax risks compound strategic execution challenges for both companies, such as GE\u2019s need to satisfy regulatory conditions and RTX\u2019s need to manage segment realignment and cost reduction initiatives effectively.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - GE may incur a significant tax liability if the GE Vernova spin-off is not tax-free, and it may also incur non-U.S. cash taxes and non-cash tax expenses including potential impairments of deferred tax assets.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - RTX highlights the risk of not achieving the intended tax-free qualification of its internal restructurings and the Raytheon merger, which could result in unexpected tax liabilities.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both GE and RTX face strategic risks tied to the tax-free qualification of their respective restructuring and separation strategies. GE\u2019s risks are tied to external regulatory conditions and potential liabilities for both the company and shareholders, while RTX\u2019s risks are more internal and tied to the successful execution of its strategic initiatives."

      "answer": "Both GE and RTX rely heavily on long-term aftermarket contracts, which increases the complexity and risk in their financial reporting due to the need for ongoing estimation of costs and revenues. GE's Aerospace segment generates over 70% of its revenue from services, including aftermarket parts and maintenance, which implies a significant portion of its financial performance is tied to ongoing service contracts. RTX explicitly states that for long-term aftermarket contracts, revenue is recognized over the contract period, and it uses percentage-of-completion accounting based on incurred costs relative to total estimated costs. RTX also discloses that changes in these estimates are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis, which can materially affect profitability. Therefore, both companies face financial reporting complexity and risk from their reliance on long-term aftermarket contracts, as small changes in cost or revenue estimates can significantly impact reported earnings.",

Similarly, RTX could face significant tax liabilities if the spin-offs of Carrier and Otis are deemed taxable under Section 355(e) of the Code, particularly if post-spin-off acquisitions result in a 50% or greater interest in Carrier, Otis, or RTX. Under the tax matters agreement, Carrier and Otis are required to indemnify RTX for certain taxes, but if RTX cannot collect those indemnifications, it would incur significant losses.

      "answer": "FedEx recorded a $36 million goodwill impairment charge for FedEx Dataworks due to ShopRunner's underperformance and failure to meet synergy expectations, which reflects the requirements of ASC 350. This standard mandates recognizing an impairment loss when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, requiring immediate recognition of the loss upon identification. In contrast, GE accounts for loss contingencies under ASC 450 by recording liabilities at the low-end of a range when a range of possible losses exists with equal likelihood. This highlights a key distinction in GAAP: while goodwill impairments must be recognized immediately upon determination, loss contingencies allow for estimation techniques that reflect uncertainty over time and outcome. FedEx's charge was a discrete event tied to an acquisition's performance, whereas GE's approach to contingencies reflects a more generalized risk management framework involving ongoing uncertainties.",

In contrast, GE recognizes a liability for loss contingencies when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, using the best estimate of the loss or the low end of a range if no single estimate is better.

      "answer": "The EPA's rule designating PFAS as 'hazardous substances' under CERCLA could significantly impact both FedEx and Lockheed Martin by increasing their environmental remediation costs and regulatory liabilities. FedEx may incur remediation costs for currently and formerly operated facilities due to historical PFAS contamination from FAA-approved firefighting foams. Lockheed Martin, on the other hand, has identified PFAS contamination at many of its environmental remediation sites from past use of PFAS-containing products and processes, which could lead to increased cleanup costs at those locations. Both companies are subject to potential liability for PFAS cleanup, with FedEx committed to transitioning to PFAS-free firefighting materials and Lockheed Martin facing potential regulatory enforcement actions and increased obligations under U.S. Government contracts.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - FedEx may incur remediation costs for current and formerly operated facilities due to PFAS contamination from FAA-approved firefighting foams, with a commitment to transition to PFAS-free materials.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Lockheed Martin has identified PFAS contamination at many of its environmental remediation sites from past use of PFAS-containing products and processes, potentially leading to increased cleanup costs.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies face increased environmental liabilities and remediation costs due to the EPA's PFAS designation under CERCLA, though their specific exposure points differ based on their operations and historical use of PFAS-containing materials."

Lockheed Martin allocated $4.0 billion to its 2022 ASR transaction, which was funded through the issuance of senior unsecured notes.

      "answer": "Interest rate fluctuations impact CAT's derivative instruments through their role in determining the value of $27.0 billion in total notional amounts of derivatives as of December 31, 2024. These instruments reference interest rates, among other factors, to calculate the actual amounts exchanged between parties. On the other hand, RTX's pension income is affected by interest rate changes as noted in their 2024 10-K, where a $0.1 billion change in Non-service pension income in 2023 was partially attributed to the increase in interest rates during 2022 and prior years. Higher interest rates typically reduce the present value of future pension obligations, which can improve pension funding status. However, RTX's pension asset returns were below expectations, which offset some of these benefits. Thus, while CAT's derivatives are directly valued using interest rates, RTX's pension calculations are indirectly influenced through discounting mechanisms and asset return assumptions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - CAT's 10-K reveals that the value of $27.0 billion in derivative instruments as of December 31, 2024, is calculated by referencing interest rates among other terms.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - While both companies disclose exposure to interest rates, CAT's derivatives are directly tied to interest rate valuations, whereas RTX's pension income is indirectly affected through discounting mechanisms and expected returns on plan assets."

However, the filing does not explicitly state the number of ESOP shares held by RTX at the end of 2023 or 2024. Therefore, we cannot calculate a specific change in RTX's ESOP shares from the given data.",
        "Step 3: Since the question requires a combined total change and only CAT provides specific numbers for ESOP shares held at the end of both years, we can only use CAT's data. The RTX filing introduces a qualitative change in ESOP usage but does not provide the necessary quantitative details to calculate a change in shares. Thus, the combined change is based solely on CAT's ESOP share reduction of 0.9 million shares."

We can contribute cash or RTX shares to our plans at our discretion, subject to applicable regulations. As of December 31, 2024, the total investment by the U.S. qualified pension plans in RTX shares was less than 1% of total plan assets.\n\nOur domestic defined contribution plan uses an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) for certain employer matching contributions. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we expanded the use of ESOP shares to fund our matching contributions to additional participants who had previously received matching contributions in cash.\n\nWe made net income tax payments of $1.2 billion, $1.5 billion, and $2.4 billion in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. A provision enacted in the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 related to the capitalization of research and experimental expenditures for tax purposes became effective on January 1, 2022. As such, we made incremental income tax payments of $1.6 billion in 2022.  In  September and  December 2023, the  Internal  Revenue  Service (IRS) issued interim guidance, retroactive to 2022, clarifying the capitalization requirements for certain types of research and ex perimental ex penditures. The Company's analysis indicates the guidance provided in the notices will result in fewer costs being subject to capitalization, and as such, costs previously required to be capitalized are now deductible in the year incurred. These notices resulted in the Company making lower income tax payments in 2023 compared to 2022.\n\nIncluded in cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations are payments related to our operating lease obligations. See 'Note 11: Leases' within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for actual and ex pected payments on operating lease obligations.\n\nIn addition, the majority of our cash flows for purchase obligations are classified as cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations. We expect future payments related to our purchase obligations to be $40.1 billion, of which $25.5 billion is payable in 2025. Purchase obligations include current amounts committed for the purchase of goods and services under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders, and do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future. Approximately  50%  of  our  purchase  obligations  described  above  represent  purchase  orders  for  products  to  be  delivered  under  firm  contracts  with  the  U.S. government for which we have full recourse under customary contract termination clauses.\n\nWhile the timing of cash flows are subject to a number of variables, for the Powder Metal Matter we estimate the accrual for expected customer compensation to be utilized consistent with the timing of ex ecution of the fleet management plan, the period of increased aircraft on ground levels, and contractual terms with customers. We currently estimate a full year 2025 cash impact related to the Powder Metal Matter of approximately $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, which includes the impact of cash paid, customer credits applied and the timing of partner recovery.\n\n## Cash Flow - Investing Activities\n\n",

Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax  rate as a result of a change in the mix  of earnings between U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions or among jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates. In addition, our future results of operations could also be adversely affected by changes in our overall profitability, changes in tax  laws or treaties or in their application or interpretation, changes in tax  rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures. We are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations. If our effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. For information regarding additional legal matters related to our taxes, please see Note 6 - 'Income taxes' and Note 22 - 'Environmental and legal matters' of Part II, Item 8 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Costs associated with lawsuits or investigations or adverse rulings in enforcement or other legal proceedings may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\nWe are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in virtually every part of the world. We face risk of exposure to various types of claims, lawsuits and government investigations. We are involved in various claims and lawsuits related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including claimed asbestos exposure), contracts, employment issues, environmental matters, intellectual property rights, tax, securities and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business.  The industries in which we operate are also periodically reviewed or investigated by regulators, which could lead to  enforcement  actions,  fines  and  penalties  or  the  assertion  of  private  litigation  claims.    It  is  not  possible  to  predict  with  certainty  the  outcome  of  claims, investigations and lawsuits, and we could in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations or financial condition in any particular period.\n\nThe global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time. In addition, subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves. Such payments could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.\n\n## New regulations or changes in financial services regulation could adversely impact Caterpillar and Cat Financial.\n\nCat Financial's operations are highly regulated by governmental authorities in the locations where it operates, which can impose significant additional costs and/or restrictions on its business. In the United States, for ex ample, certain Cat Financial activities are subject to the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act  (Dodd-Frank),  which  includes  extensive  provisions  regulating  the  financial  services  industry. As  a  result,  Cat  Financial  has  become  and  could continue to become subject to additional regulatory costs that could be significant and have an adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our results of operations and financial condition. Changes in regulations or additional regulations in the United States or internationally impacting the financial services industry could also add significant cost or operational constraints that might have an adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our results of operations and financial condition.",

In addition, during the term of the DPAs, the DPAs' transaction-related requirements may impact our ability to execute potential future divestitures within ex pected timeframes or consistent with expected valuation metrics, which could delay or impair our ability to achieve the expected benefits from our strategic plan, or otherwise harm our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\n\nWe are subject to litigation, environmental, anti-corruption, and other legal and compliance risks. We are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks.  These risks relate to, among other things, product safety and reliability, personal injuries, intellectual property rights, contract-related claims, government contracts, taxes, environmental matters, the use of artificial intelligence, ex port control, sanctions, employment matters, securities laws, competition laws, and laws governing improper business practices. We or one of our businesses could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such matters. If convicted or found liable, we could be subject to significant fines, penalties, repayments, or other damages (in certain cases, treble damages). Product recalls and product liability and warranty claims can result in significant damages and costs, including fines, as well as other harm to our business as discussed above. As a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the U.S. and in other countries in which we operate. Those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways. They may also change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. Changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses. Uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights.\n\nWe use hazardous substances and generate hazardous wastes in certain of our operations. We also rely upon the use of chemical substances that are heavily regulated in connection with our products, manufacturing processes and operation of our facilities. As a result, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to potential non-compliance and both personal injuries or property damage that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. Personal injury lawsuits may involve individual and purported class actions alleging that contaminants originating from our current or former products or operating facilities caused or contributed to medical conditions, including cancers or other illnesses incurred by employees, former employees, third-parties' employees, or residents in the area, and environmental damage or diminution of real estate values. For example, we are investigating and remediating contamination related to past practices at a number of  properties  and,  in  some  cases,  have  been  named  as  a  defendant  in  related  'tox ic  tort'  claims.  We  are  also  subject  to  laws  and  regulations  that:  (1)  impose requirements for chemical substances and the proper management, treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes; (2) restrict air and water emissions from our operations (including U.S. government-owned facilities we manage); and (3) require maintenance of a safe workplace. These laws and regulations can lead to substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and may require the installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions, decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases, and/or reduce the risks of injury to people. We incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and other expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations. A criminal violation of certain U.S. environmental statutes such as the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act could result in suspension, debarment, or disqualification by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). A facility determined to be in violation of the criminal provisions of these statutes can be prohibited from performing any U.S. government contract work until the violation has been corrected and the EPA approves the reinstatement of the facility. Even in litigation where we believe our liability is remote, there is a risk that a negative finding or decision in a matter involving multiple plaintiffs or a purported class action could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity, in particular with respect to environmental claims in regions where we have, or previously had, significant operations. In addition, new laws, regulations, or governmental policies, sudden changes in the interpretation and enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of new clean-up standards could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\n\nIn addition, the FCPA and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to U.S. and non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. These laws apply to companies, individual directors, officers, employees, and agents. U.S. companies also may be held liable for actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives. The FCPA also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded U.S. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments. Certain of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are with governmental entities and are, therefore, subject to the FCPA and other antibribery and anti-corruption laws, including the anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws of non-U.S. countries. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery and anti-corruption  laws.  Despite  meaningful  measures  that  we  undertake  to  ensure  lawful  conduct,  which  include  training  and  internal  control  policies,  these measures may not always prevent violations of the FCPA or similar laws. As discussed above and as previously disclosed, in October 2024, the Company entered into a DPA with the DOJ and consented to the entry of an SEC Administrative Order to resolve investigations related to conduct that, among other things, violated the FCPA. We have been subject to regulatory investigations for alleged violations of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, and could be subject to such",

      "answer": "Caterpillar structures its long-term incentives through formalized nonqualified stock option awards under its 2023 Long-Term Incentive Plan, with region-specific addendums like the China Payroll Addendum, indicating a tailored, regulatory-compliant approach to global executive compensation. RTX, on the other hand, integrates nonqualified stock options into a broader performance-linked equity plan that includes performance share units (PSUs) and assumes target-level performance for 2023 and 2024 awards, with up to an additional 1,842,684 shares of RTX Common Stock issuable if maximum performance is achieved. This shows that Caterpillar emphasizes structured award frameworks, while RTX emphasizes performance-based outcomes in its long-term incentive strategy.",

        "Step 2: From RTX's 10-K, extract the integration of nonqualified stock options with performance share units (PSUs), noting that up to 1,842,684 additional shares could be issued based on maximum performance, showing a performance-contingent incentive model.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the two approaches to determine that Caterpillar's strategy is more structured and regulatory-focused, while RTX's is more performance-driven and outcome-variable."

          "chunk_text": "HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts)\n\n## NOTE 11. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING TRANSACTIONS\n\n## DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its risks related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading or other speculative purposes. To qualify as a hedge, derivative financial  instruments  must  be  evaluated  for  hedge  effectiveness  at  the  inception  of  the  contract  and  designated  as  a  hedge. Changes in fair value of the derivative contract must be highly correlated with changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception and over the life of the hedge contract.\n\n## FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nThe  Company  operates  a  global  business  in  a  wide  variety  of  foreign  currencies.  The  Company's  exposure  to  market  risk  for changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  arises  from  international  financing  activities  between  subsidiaries,  foreign  currency denominated  monetary  assets  and  liabilities,  and  transactions  arising  from  international  trade.  The  Company's  objective  is  to preserve  the  U.S.  Dollar  value  of  foreign  currency  denominated  cash  flows  and  earnings.  The  Company  monitors  its  collective foreign  currency  exposure  and  enters  into  foreign  currency  exchange  forward  and  option  contracts  (foreign  currency  exchange contracts) with third parties, when necessary, to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nThe Company has monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Prior to conversion into U.S. dollars, these assets and liabilities are remeasured at spot exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. The effects of changes in spot  rates  are  recognized  in  earnings  and  included  in  Other  (income)  expense.  The  Company  uses  foreign  currency  exchange contracts  to  hedge  its  foreign  currency  exposure.  These  contracts  are  marked-to-market  with  the  resulting  gains  and  losses recognized in earnings offsetting the gains and losses on the non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities being hedged. The Company uses foreign currency contracts to hedge forecasted sales and purchases, which are denominated in non-functional currencies. Changes in the forecasted non-functional currency cash flows due to movements in exchange rates are substantially offset by changes in the fair value of these foreign currency exchange contracts designated as hedges. Market value gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in earnings when the hedged transaction is recognized. As of December 31, 2021, and 2020, the Company held contracts with notional amounts of $12,671 million and $16,123 million to exchange foreign\n\ncurrencies, principally the U.S. Dollar, Euro, Canadian Dollar, British Pound, Mexican Peso, Chinese Renminbi, and Indian Rupee.\n\nThe  Company  also  designates  certain  foreign  currency  debt  and  derivative  contracts  as  hedges  against  portions  of  its  net investment in foreign operations. Gains or losses of the foreign currency debt and derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges are recorded in the same manner as foreign currency translation adjustments.\n\n## INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nFinancial instruments, including derivatives, expose the Company to market risk related to changes in interest rates. The Company uses a combination of financial instruments, including long-term, medium-term, and short-term financing, variable-rate commercial paper,  and  interest  rate  swaps  to  convert  the  interest  rate  mix  of  the  Company's  total  debt  portfolio  and  related  overall  cost  of borrowing.\n\n## CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nThe  Company  continues  to  monitor  the  creditworthiness  of  its  counterparties  to  mitigate  the  risk  of  nonperformance.  Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose the Company to counterparty credit risk. In addition, the Company grants credit terms to its customers in the normal course of business. The terms and conditions of the Company's credit sales are designed to mitigate or eliminate  concentrations  of  credit  risk  with  any  single  customer.  The  Company's  sales  are  not  materially  dependent  on  a  single customer or a small group of customers.\n\n80\n\nHoneywell International Inc.",

In addition, the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios, these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts. We adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions. Additionally, changes in the fair value of foreign currency derivatives and commodity derivatives are offset by changes in the cash flows of the underlying hedged foreign currency and commodity transactions.\n\n",

      "answer": "HON specifically reports the carrying value of foreign currency-denominated debt instruments designated as net investment hedges at $4,074 million as of December 31, 2021, including foreign currency transaction gains or losses directly in its balance sheet presentation. In contrast, UPS discloses that it uses foreign currency-denominated debt instruments to hedge net investments in foreign operations but does not report a specific carrying value. Instead, UPS emphasizes that gains and losses from these instruments are recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment accounts within other comprehensive income until the foreign entity is sold or substantially liquidated. This means HON's balance sheet reflects the adjusted carrying value of the debt instruments, while UPS's strategy focuses on offsetting translation risk through comprehensive income without explicitly stating the debt's carrying value.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nWe also hedge portions of our anticipated cash settlements of intercompany transactions and interest payments on certain debt subject to foreign currency remeasurement using foreign currency forward contracts. We normally designate and account for these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions; therefore, the resulting gains and losses from these hedges are recognized as a component of Investment income (expense) and other when the underlying transactions are subject to currency remeasurement.\n\nWe hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations with foreign currency denominated debt instruments. The use of foreign denominated debt as the hedging instrument allows the debt to be remeasured to foreign currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive income to offset the translation risk from those investments. Balances in the cumulative translation adjustment accounts remain until the sale or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity, upon which they are recognized as a component of Investment income (expense) and other .\n\n## Interest Rate Risk Management\n\nOur indebtedness under our various financing arrangements creates interest rate risk. We use a combination of derivative instruments as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. Interest rate swaps allow us to maintain a target range of floating-rate debt within our capital structure. The notional amount, interest payment date and maturity date of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt being hedged.\n\nWe have designated and account for the majority of our interest rate swaps that convert fixed-rate interest payments into floating-rate interest payments as fair value hedges of the associated debt instruments. Therefore, the gains and losses resulting from fair value adjustments to the interest rate swaps and fair value adjustments to the associated debt instruments are recorded to interest expense in the period in which the gains and losses occur. We have designated and account for interest rate swaps that convert floating-rate interest payments into fixed-rate interest payments as cash flow hedges of the forecasted payment obligations. The gains and losses resulting from fair value adjustments to these interest rate swaps are recorded to other comprehensive income.\n\nWe periodically hedge the forecasted fixed-coupon interest payments associated with anticipated debt offerings by using forward starting interest rate swaps, interest rate locks or similar derivatives. These agreements effectively lock a portion of our interest rate exposure between the time the agreement is entered into and the date when the debt offering is completed, thereby mitigating the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense. These derivatives are settled commensurate with the issuance of the debt, and any gain or loss upon settlement is amortized as an adjustment to the effective interest yield on the debt.\n\n## Outstanding Positions\n\nThe notional amounts of our outstanding derivative positions as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

In  particular,  lower  demand  for  air  travel  may  continue  to  cause  our  customers  to  delay  or  suspend  spending  in connection with the manufacturing, repair, overhaul or servicing of aircraft, and there may be long-term deterioration in demand for air travel that could impact our business beyond the current COVID-19 health crisis. Customers may also continue to attempt to  renegotiate contracts and obtain concessions, face financial constraints on their ability to make payments to us on a timely basis or at all, or enter into bankruptcy or discontinue their business operations, and we may continue to be required to discount the pricing of our products. In addition, unfavorable customer site conditions, such as closure of or access restrictions to customer facilities,  and  disruptions  to  our  customers'  third-party  logistics,  warehousing,  inventory  management,  and  distribution  services may continue to limit our ability to sell products, meet billing milestones, or provide services.\n- Operations Risk -The closure of our facilities, restrictions inhibiting our employees' ability to access those facilities, materials and labor shortages, and disruptions to the ability of our suppliers or service providers to deliver goods or services to us (including as a result of supplier facility closures or access restrictions, disruptions to their supply chains, and supplier liquidity or bankruptcy risk) could further disrupt our ability to provide our services and solutions and result in, among other things, higher costs which may not be recoverable under customer contracts, claims for liquidated damages in the event of delays, terminations of customer contracts and losses of revenue. Because the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our near-term and long-term revenues, earnings,  liquidity,  and  cash  flows,  we  have  taken  and  may  be  required  to  redeploy  significant  cost  actions,  including  but  not limited to reducing discretionary expenses (such as non-essential travel, contractors, and consultants), reducing hiring, canceling annual merit increases, reducing executive and board of director pay, reducing work schedules across the enterprise, shortening or staggering work schedules to match production with demand, and reducing staffing levels, as well as increasing supplier-based productivity and enhancing spending-limit controls. However, the extent to which our mitigation efforts are successful, if at all, is not currently ascertainable; also, our costs may not decrease at the same pace as revenue declines as many of our costs are less variable in nature, and we may not be able to or may not choose to significantly reduce them in an effort to remain focused on long-term  outlook  and  growth  opportunities.  Further,  our  management  of  the  impact  of  COVID-19  will  continue  to  require significant investment of time from our management and employees, as well as resources across our global enterprise. The focus on managing and mitigating the impacts of COVID-19 on our business may cause us to divert or delay the application of our resources toward new initiatives or investments, which may adversely impact our future results of operations. Issues relating to the  COVID-19  pandemic  may  also  result  in  legal  claims  or  litigation  against  us.

If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may need to use existing cash balances to service our debt, and if such balances are insufficient, then we may be required to engage in one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring of existing debt, issuing new debt, or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time.\n\nDue to the changing landscape of the COVID-19 pandemic and the responses to curb its spread, we cannot predict the ultimate impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flow. Any recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic impact may be slowed or reversed by a variety of factors.

This regulatory burden, including employment regulations, affects more than half of HON\u2019s sales that come from non-U.S. jurisdictions. Similarly, UPS notes exposure to 'increasingly complex and stringent laws, regulations and policies,' including employment regulations, which could 'materially increase our operating costs' and require significant capital expenditures. Both companies are impacted by regulatory complexity, but HON specifically highlights how compliance costs limit strategic flexibility, while UPS emphasizes potential cost increases and the difficulty of predicting future regulatory impacts.",

In  particular,  lower  demand  for  air  travel  may  continue  to  cause  our  customers  to  delay  or  suspend  spending  in connection with the manufacturing, repair, overhaul or servicing of aircraft, and there may be long-term deterioration in demand for air travel that could impact our business beyond the current COVID-19 health crisis. Customers may also continue to attempt to  renegotiate contracts and obtain concessions, face financial constraints on their ability to make payments to us on a timely basis or at all, or enter into bankruptcy or discontinue their business operations, and we may continue to be required to discount the pricing of our products. In addition, unfavorable customer site conditions, such as closure of or access restrictions to customer facilities,  and  disruptions  to  our  customers'  third-party  logistics,  warehousing,  inventory  management,  and  distribution  services may continue to limit our ability to sell products, meet billing milestones, or provide services.\n- Operations Risk -The closure of our facilities, restrictions inhibiting our employees' ability to access those facilities, materials and labor shortages, and disruptions to the ability of our suppliers or service providers to deliver goods or services to us (including as a result of supplier facility closures or access restrictions, disruptions to their supply chains, and supplier liquidity or bankruptcy risk) could further disrupt our ability to provide our services and solutions and result in, among other things, higher costs which may not be recoverable under customer contracts, claims for liquidated damages in the event of delays, terminations of customer contracts and losses of revenue. Because the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our near-term and long-term revenues, earnings,  liquidity,  and  cash  flows,  we  have  taken  and  may  be  required  to  redeploy  significant  cost  actions,  including  but  not limited to reducing discretionary expenses (such as non-essential travel, contractors, and consultants), reducing hiring, canceling annual merit increases, reducing executive and board of director pay, reducing work schedules across the enterprise, shortening or staggering work schedules to match production with demand, and reducing staffing levels, as well as increasing supplier-based productivity and enhancing spending-limit controls. However, the extent to which our mitigation efforts are successful, if at all, is not currently ascertainable; also, our costs may not decrease at the same pace as revenue declines as many of our costs are less variable in nature, and we may not be able to or may not choose to significantly reduce them in an effort to remain focused on long-term  outlook  and  growth  opportunities.  Further,  our  management  of  the  impact  of  COVID-19  will  continue  to  require significant investment of time from our management and employees, as well as resources across our global enterprise. The focus on managing and mitigating the impacts of COVID-19 on our business may cause us to divert or delay the application of our resources toward new initiatives or investments, which may adversely impact our future results of operations.

Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.\n\nWe are regularly under audit by tax authorities in many jurisdictions. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue may make resolving tax disputes more difficult. The final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, and changes in taxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions may materially adversely impact our tax expense and cash flows.\n\n## Regulatory and Legal Risks\n\n## Increasingly complex and stringent laws, regulations and policies could materially increase our operating costs.\n\nWe are subject to complex and stringent aviation, transportation, environmental, security, labor, employment, safety, privacy and data protection and other governmental laws, regulations and policies, both in the U.S. and internationally. In addition, we are impacted by laws, regulations and policies that affect global trade, including tariff and trade policies, export requirements, taxes, monetary policies and other restrictions and charges. Trade discussions between the U.S. and various of its trading partners are fluid, and existing and future trade agreements are, and are expected to continue to be, subject to a number of uncertainties, including the imposition of new tariffs or adjustments and changes to the products covered by existing tariffs. The impact of new laws, regulations and policies or decisions or interpretations by authorities applying those laws and regulations, cannot be predicted. Compliance with any new laws, regulations or policies may increase our operating costs or require significant capital expenditures. Any failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or policies in the U.S. or other countries could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations, which could materially adversely affect us.\n\n## Increasingly stringent regulations related to climate change could materially increase our operating costs.\n\nRegulation of greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions exposes us to potentially significant new taxes, fees and other costs. Compliance with such regulation, and any increased or additional regulation, or the associated costs is further complicated by the fact that various countries and regions may adopt different approaches to climate change regulation.\n\nFor example, in 2016, the International Civil Aviation Organization ('ICAO') adopted the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation ('CORSIA'), which is a global, market-based emissions offset program to encourage carbonneutral growth. A voluntary participation pilot phase began in 2021, and full mandatory participation is scheduled to begin in 2027. ICAO continues to develop details regarding implementation, but compliance with CORSIA will increase our operating costs.\n\nIn the U.S., Congress has considered but, to date, not passed various bills that would regulate GHG emissions. Nevertheless, we believe some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future. Even in the absence of such legislation, the Environmental Protection Agency could determine to regulate GHG emissions, especially aircraft or diesel engine emissions, and this could impose substantial costs on us.\n\nIn addition, the impact that the recent re-entry into the Paris climate accord may have on future U.S. policy regarding GHG emissions, on CORSIA and on other GHG regulation remains uncertain. The extent to which other countries implement that accord could also have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nIncreased regulation relating to GHG emissions in the U.S. or abroad, especially aircraft or diesel engine emissions, could increase the cost of fuel and other energy we purchase and the capital costs associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicles prematurely. We cannot predict the impact any future regulation would have on our cost structure or our operating results. It is likely that such regulation could significantly increase our operating costs and that we may not be willing or able to pass such costs along to our customers. Moreover, even without such regulation, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the GHGs emitted by companies in the airline and transportation industries could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services, especially our air services.",

The Board has appointed a Risk Committee, consisting entirely of independent directors, whose responsibilities include assisting the Board in overseeing management's identification and evaluation of strategic enterprise risks, including risks associated with privacy, technology, information security, cybersecurity and cyber incident response and business continuity. The Risk Committee regularly updates the Board on these activities.\n\nThe Risk Committee oversees the Company's approach to cybersecurity risk assessment and mitigation by, among other things, (i) reviewing the Company's cybersecurity insurance program, (ii) reviewing the Company's cybersecurity budget, (iii) discussing the results of various internal cybersecurity audits and periodic independent third-party assessments of the Company's cybersecurity programs, (iv) being briefed on cybersecurity matters by outside experts, and (v) receiving regular updates from the Company's Chief Information Security Officer ('CISO') and others on cybersecurity risks, operational metrics, compliance and regulatory developments, training programs, risk mitigation activities, key projects and industry developments. The Company's Chief Legal and Compliance Officer (\"CLCO\"), Chief Digital and Technology Officer (\"CDTO\"), CISO and Vice President of Compliance and Internal Audit participate in Risk Committee meetings and meet individually with the Risk Committee on a periodic basis to discuss and address relevant matters, including the Company's approach to cybersecurity risk assessment and mitigation. The CISO reports to the CDTO, who in turn reports to the Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\"). The CISO has more than thirty years of IT experience, has served many years in various information security management roles and has multiple cybersecurity certifications.\n\nThe Company maintains an enterprise risk management process designed to identify potential events that may affect the achievement of the Company's objectives or have a material adverse effect on the Company. Cybersecurity is among the risks considered as a part of this process. The Company's management, including the CISO, also participates on the Company's Information Security &amp; Privacy Governance Council ('ISPGC'). The ISPGC meets periodically to consider information security and privacy matters.\n\nThe Company utilizes various technical and qualitative processes to assist in identifying, assessing and managing cybersecurity risks. The Company's processes include periodic discussions and risk reviews with management. These processes also include, depending on facts and circumstances, internal audits, third-party assessments, post-remediation reviews, engagements with independent third-party service providers and key governmental agencies, regular employee training, an incident response plan and backup and recovery plans. Our periodic engagements with independent third-party service providers are designed to provide qualitative and technical cybersecurity assessments. The Company has a corporate-level cybersecurity team, led by the CISO, that, among other responsibilities, receives and reviews reports regarding potential threats, trends and remediation strategies. The cybersecurity team evaluates threat intelligence and information obtained from various sources, including internal, public or private sources, government agencies and external consultants. Certain of the Company's subsidiaries have separate cybersecurity teams that, along with the corporate-level cybersecurity team, play a role in the Company's efforts to monitor, identify, assess and manage cybersecurity risks.\n\nThe Company interacts with the information technology networks and systems of third parties for many aspects of our business. We consider and evaluate cybersecurity risks associated with the use of independent third-party service providers. To help UPS understand and mitigate potential cybersecurity risks related to third parties, we generally utilize measures such as vendor risk assessments, periodic technical assessments of third-party vendors' controls and contracts governing the use of and access to our data and compliance with our security requirements.\n\nWe maintain an Incident Response Plan that includes processes and procedures for reviewing and responding to cybersecurity incidents. We periodically test our readiness to respond to a cybersecurity incident through various scenario-based drills. The Incident Response Plan includes processes for escalation to the CISO, the Executive Leadership Team, including the CEO, the Risk Committee and the Board, and a process for consideration of whether a cybersecurity incident is material and may require disclosure in SEC filings.\n\nFor additional information on cybersecurity risks and the impact they may have on our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition see \"Risk Factors - Business and Operating Risks - A significant cybersecurity incident, or increased data protection regulations, could materially adversely affect us\".",

How does this quantification of commitments, which includes letters of credit and surety bonds, contrast with UPS's approach to accounting for contract modifications, which are instead recognized prospectively based on performance obligations?",
      "answer": "General Dynamics discloses $1.8 billion in financial arrangements that include letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds, and other commitments tied to contract modifications. These represent significant upfront financial exposure that General Dynamics manages through contractual guarantees and customer-directed scope changes. In contrast, UPS does not quantify contract modifications in monetary terms but instead accounts for them prospectively based on performance obligations. UPS treats modifications that add distinct services as separate contracts and those that don't as price changes to existing services, recognizing revenue as performance obligations are fulfilled. This highlights a fundamental difference in how the two companies disclose and manage contract modification risk\u2014GD through explicit financial guarantees and UPS through operational accounting aligned with service delivery.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Satisfaction of Performance Obligations\n\nWe generally recognize revenue over time as we perform services in the contract because our customers receive the benefit of our services as goods are transported from one location to another. Further, if we were unable to complete delivery to the final location, those services would not need to be re-performed.\n\nWe recognize revenue based on the extent of progress towards completion of our services. We use the cost-to-cost measure of progress for our package delivery contracts because it best depicts the benefit received by the customer, which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. Under this measure, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the service. Revenues, including ancillary or accessorial fees and reductions for estimated customer incentives, are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. Costs to fulfill include labor and other direct costs and an allocation of indirect costs.\n\nFor our freight forwarding contracts, an output method of progress based on time-in-transit is utilized as the timing of costs incurred does not best depict the benefit to the customer. In our Logistics business we have a right to consideration from customers in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customers of our performance completed to date; therefore we recognize revenue in the amount to which we have a right to invoice the customer.\n\n## Variable Consideration\n\nOur contracts commonly contain customer incentives, guaranteed service refunds or other provisions that can either increase or decrease the rates paid for services. These variable amounts are generally dependent upon achievement of certain incentive tiers or performance metrics. We record revenue, which may be reduced by incentives or other contract provisions, to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative amounts recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Our estimates of revenue are based on an assessment of anticipated customer spending and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us.\n\n## Contract Modifications\n\nContracts are often modified to account for changes in the rates we charge our customers or to add additional, distinct services. We consider contract modifications to exist when the modification either creates new, or changes the existing, enforceable rights and obligations. Contract modifications that add distinct goods or services are treated as separate contracts. Contract modifications that do not add distinct goods or services typically change the price of existing services. These contract modifications are accounted for prospectively as the remaining performance obligations are distinct.\n\n## Payment Terms\n\nUnder the typical payment terms of our customer contracts, customers pay at periodic intervals, which are generally seven days within our U.S. Domestic Package business, for shipments included on invoices received. Invoices are generated each week on the week-ending day, which is Saturday for the majority of our U.S. Domestic Package business, but could be another day depending on the business unit or the specific agreement with the customer. It is not customary business practice to ex tend payment terms past 90 days and, as such, we do not have a practice of including a significant financing component within our contracts with customers.\n\n## Principal vs. Agent Considerations\n\nIn our transportation businesses, we may utilize independent contractors and third-party carriers to perform transportation services. We have determined that all our major businesses act as principal rather than agent within their revenue arrangements. Consequently, revenue and the associated purchased transportation costs are reported on a gross basis within our statements of consolidated income.\n\n## Accounts Receivable, Net\n\nAccounts receivable, net , include amounts billed and currently due from customers. The amounts due are stated at their net estimated realizable value. Losses on accounts receivable are recognized when reasonable and supportable forecasts affect the expected collectability. This requires us to make our best estimate of the current expected losses inherent in our accounts receivable at each balance sheet date. These estimates require consideration of historical loss experience, adjusted for current conditions, forward-looking indicators, trends in customer payment frequency, and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data, including present and future economic conditions and the financial health of specific customers and",

However, UPS utilizes alternative methods like output-based time-in-transit for freight forwarding, while GD consistently applies cost-to-cost for most long-term contracts.

In  2024, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, using the retrospective m ethod of adoption.

The ASU requires disclosure of disaggregated incom e tax inform ation, including the effective tax rate reconciliation and incom e taxes paid. In Novem ber 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Disaggregation - Incom e Statem ent Expenses. The ASU requires disclosure of certain disaggregated costs and expenses on an annual and interim  basis in the notes to the financial statements. ASU 2024-03 is effective for annual periods beginning after Decem ber 15, 2026, using the prospective or retrospective m ethods of adoption, with early adoption perm itted.

W e do not expect that the adoption of these standards will have a m aterial im pact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\n## B. REVENUE\n\nPerformance Obligations. A performance obligation is a prom ise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the custom er, and is the unit of account for revenue. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct perform ance obligation within that contract and recognized as revenue when, or as, the perform ance obligation is satisfied. The m ajority of our contracts have a single perform ance obligation as the prom ise to transfer the individual goods or services is not separately identifiable from  other prom ises in the contracts and is, therefore, not distinct. Som e of our contracts have m ultiple perform ance obligations, m ost com m only due to the contract covering m ultiple phases of the product life cycle (developm ent, production,  m aintenance  and  support).  For  contracts  with  m ultiple  perform ance  obligations,  we  allocate  the  contract's  transaction  price  to  each performance obligation using our best estim ate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. The prim ary m ethod used to estim ate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a m argin approach, under which we forecast our expected costs of satisfying a performance obligation and then add an appropriate m argin for that distinct good or service. W e classify revenue as products or services based on the predominant attributes of the associated perform ance obligation.\n\nContract  m odifications  are  routine  in  the  perform ance  of  our  contracts.  Contracts  are  often  m odified  to  account  for  changes  in  custom er specifications or requirem ents. In m ost instances, contract m odifications are for goods or services that are not distinct and, therefore, are accounted for as part of the existing contract.\n\nOur performance obligations are satisfied over tim e as work progresses or at a point in tim e. Revenue from  products and services transferred to customers over tim e accounted for 76% of our revenue in 2024, 79% in 2023 and 77% in 2022. Substantially all of our revenue in the defense segments is recognized over tim e because control is transferred continuously to our custom ers. T ypically , revenue is recognized over tim e using costs i n cu rred to date rel ati ve to total  esti m ated costs at com pl eti on to m easure progress toward satisfying our perform ance obligations. Incurred costs represent work perform ed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the custom er.

For exam ple, the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has resulted in the im position of num erous econom ic and trade sanctions, export controls, and other restrictions targeting Russia and Belarus, and the Russian governm ent has im plem ented counter-sanctions and export controls targeting the U.S. and various foreign countries in which we operate. These actions have caused som e econom ic disruptions around the world and have exacerbated global supply chain challenges. Changes and developm ents in any of these m atters or factors m ay occur suddenly and could im pact funding for program s or delay purchasing decisions or custom er paym ents.\n\nNon-U.S. transactions can involve increased risks arising from  foreign exchange rate variability , which could, am ong other things, negatively i m pact  sal es  and  the  transl ati on  of   our  i nternati onal   revenue  f rom   l ocal   currenci es  i nto  U.S.  dol l ars,  and  di f f eri ng  l egal   system s.  Our  non-U.S. operations  are  subject  to  U.S.  and  foreign  laws  and  regulations,  including  laws  and  regulations  relating  to  im port-export  controls,  technology transfers, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other anti-corruption laws, and the International Traffic in Arm s Regulations (IT AR). An unfavorable event or trend in any one or m ore of these factors or a failure to com ply with U.S. or foreign laws could result in adm inistrative, civil or criminal  li abi l i ti es,  i n cl u di n g   su spen si on   or  debarm en t  f rom   g ov ern m en t  con tracts  or  su spen si on   of   ou r  ex port  pri v i l eg es,  an d  cou l d  m ateri al l y adversely affect revenue and earnings.\n\nIn  addition,  som e  non-U.S.  governm ent  custom ers  require  contractors  to  enter  into  letters  of  credit,  perform ance  or  surety  bonds,  bank guarantees and other sim ilar financial arrangem ents. W e m ay also be required to agree to specific in-country purchases, m anufacturing agreem ents or fi n an ci al  su pport arrangem ents, known as offsets, that require us to satisfy investm ent or other com m itm ents or face penalties. Offset requirem ents may extend over several years and could require us to team  with local com panies to fulfill these com m itm ents. If we do not satisfy these financial or offset requirem ents, our future revenue and earnings m ay be m aterially adversely affected.",
